My name is **Immanuel Leon Salomo**, and I’m currently a **Data Scientist Intern** at an ICT (Information and Communication Technology) company, **PLN Icon Plus**. In my role, I primarily work with historical customer and company asset data related to **fixed broadband services** and other infrastructure.

I'm actively building a strong portfolio to prepare myself for a full-time career in data science. I’m especially passionate about using data to solve real-world problems and uncover insights that lead to smarter and more strategic business decisions.

## 📌 About This Project

Starting on **July 30, 2025**, I began working on a project that integrates **Yelp application data**—including user reviews and business metadata—with a **simulated restaurant inspection dataset** for the Tampa, Florida area.

This repository documents the entire journey:
- The data sources used
- Key challenges and how I addressed them
- Exploratory analysis and sentiment classification
- Insights drawn from the results

The goal of this project is to **analyze sentiment trends** in Yelp reviews and explore their potential **correlation with health inspection grades and violations**, even though the grade data used here is simulated for demonstration purposes.

Thank you for stopping by and checking out my work! 😊
Feel free to explore the notebooks and results in this repo.

## 🔍 Project Objectives

- Merge restaurant inspection data with Yelp reviews (focus on restaurants in **Tampa**).
- Simulate fuzzy name matching between business datasets.
- Apply sentiment analysis using **DistilBERT (HuggingFace)** on customer reviews.
- Compare sentiment results against health inspection outcomes (e.g., grade, score).
- Visualize commonly used words in **positive vs negative reviews**.

---

## 🔧 Key Steps

1. **Data Gathering**  
   Collected datasets from Yelp (JSON) and simulated Tampa health inspections (based on NYC inspections).

2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Extracted Tampa-based reviews.  
   - Created fuzzy-matched business names.  
   - Standardized date formats and grades.  

3. **Data Merging**  
   Performed inner join between Yelp and inspection datasets using fuzzy matching logic.

4. **Sentiment Analysis**  
   Applied BERT-based classifier to Yelp reviews to label them as **POSITIVE** or **NEGATIVE**.

5. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Distribution of health grades.  
   - Relationship between sentiment and inspection scores.  
   - Most common keywords per sentiment.

6. **Word Cloud Visualization**  
   Displayed frequent words in positive and negative reviews using `WordCloud`.

## 🤖 Libraries Used

- `pandas`, `numpy`
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `wordcloud`
- `sklearn`, `fuzzywuzzy`
- `transformers` (Hugging Face)

## 📚 What I Learned

- How to **combine and clean multiple datasets** with different structures and naming conventions.
- Learned to apply **fuzzy string matching** using `fuzzywuzzy` for messy or inconsistent business name matching.
- Applied **BERT-based sentiment analysis** using Hugging Face `transformers` on real customer reviews.
- Improved understanding of **feature engineering** and **data sampling** for better model preparation.
- Practiced creating **data visualizations** (e.g., word clouds, sentiment vs grade) to draw insights.
- Gained hands-on experience with **EDA**, including analysis of relationships between sentiment and inspection outcomes.
