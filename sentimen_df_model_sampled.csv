Love the place. Worth the hour drive and will be back. The service was on point and more importantly the food was fantastic. The atmosphere was definitely a feel good Sunday vibe. Highly recommend this spot. Each dish was unique the chef has added his own flair to dishes and each bite was perfect. Everyone was super nice as well. You need to try this place.

"Feb 2018- I must continue to rave about this restaurant. Now- Old Heights Bistro is small and quaint and similar to tiny NYC restaurants. If you are looking for flashy, go elsewhere. Their flash and sparkle is their food.  The restaurant is the BEST in Seminole Heights as far as I am concerned. I would give Heights Bistro 10 stars if that was possible. The food is spot on, and I have eaten in this establishment many more times than I have checked in- and I have never had a bad experience. The seafood gumbo is outstanding, the burger is the BEST in Tampa and the service is wonderful. Natalia is just amazing and can handle the dining room single handedly. I have to give it to the owners. They have nailed what having a quality product and an amazing business is all about. Walk do not run, to this restaurant if you have not tried it yet. They also serve breakfast, and Brunch in Sunday's! 


We were invited to lunch by a local friend who is a realtor in Seminole Heights and he frequents the establishment often. I believe that it used to be Reservations to Go.

It is a small restaurant with a nice menu that also included sushi!

I ordered the burger with a large side of pasta and my lunch mates had a po-boy and the meatball sub.

The food was fantastic. The burger was so flavorful and I had it medium well with Swiss cheese, pickle, lettuce, tomato and onion. Delicious!!!!

The pasta salad is also delightful. Cooked al dente with black olives, sun dried tomato and basil- yummy.

The po-boy and the meatball sub was also delicious according to my guests.

The service was lovely and speedy as well.  We finished lunch off with a slice of carrot cake which I have to say- is to die for.

Excellent lunch experience and just another great eating establishment in Seminole Heights!!!

Gave them one star because I couldn't give them a zero. Slowest service I have ever experienced. Waited 30 minutes at the drive thru to be served and they got the order wrong.

"Whenever I'm in Tampa and staying at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, there's one thing that is an absolute MUST....besides throwing my hard earned money into the slot machines, that is. I have to pay a visit to Constant Grind, and get one of my all-time favorite desserts. It is luscious, it is decadent, and it is called the Chocolate Hazelnut Crunch. Light, airy espresso cream between several thin layers of fudgy chocolate cake and covered in chocolate ganache and crunchy hazelnuts. It's fashioned as a torte, and I'm not sure if one would call it a cake or a torte, but to me, it's simply one of the best desserts I've ever had...to the point that I recommend it to other patrons standing in line who are first-timers and undecided. If you've never had it, definitely get it, trust me.

Honorable mention goes to the Cannoli Cheesecake, which is also scrumptious, topped with 2 mini cannolis dipped in chocolate and pistachios. Constant Grind caters to sweet lovers of all types, serving up varieties of fudge, baked goods, gelatos, beautiful chocolates, and even macarons. On the savory side, they also offer various selections of tempting sandwiches and coffee beverages. 

I always take my dessert to go and devour in the comfort of my hotel room while binge-watching some random crime show. Constant Grind is easily one of the best parts of The Hard Rock Tampa, and it's great that they're open until 11pm to satisfy those late-night sweet cravings. Last but not least, a big thank you goes out to the staff for always giving such great service on every visit!

Till next time, my fellow Yeeps, support your local eats and businesses, and as always....SYOY!",5,A,Constant Grind - Seminole Hard Rock Tampa,Constant Grind - Seminole Hard Rock Tampa,C0nstant Grind - Semin0le Hard R0ck Tampa,5.0,POSITIVE
"I was visiting Tampa this weekend with some friends and we decided to try Streetcar Charlie's.  The location was great with nice views of the street car line and the atmosphere inside was light and airy in the main dinning room but very dark in the bar area where we were seated.  The menu left something to be desired.  There were salads, burgers and sandwiches as well as some higher priced entrees but everyone in my group of 5 had trouble finding something that sounded good.  We decided to go on the lighter side ordering some appetizers, a cuban sandwich and chicken salad.  None of the meals were anything special.  The cuban sandwich was heavy on the mayo, light on the meat and cheese.  The salad was ordinary and the appetizers came out cold.  Unfortunately, we later discovered that the appetizers were probably undercooked because later that evening, those that ate the crab cakes came down with a nasty case of food poisoning.  Not exactly a great way to make a good impression for a dining establishment.  The surrounding area is home to all kinds of pubs and restaurants, my recommendation is to look elsewhere and skip Streetcar Charlie's.  I know none of us will go back.",30,C,Streetcar Charlie's Bar & Grille,Streetcar Charlie's Bar & Grille,Streetcar Charlie's Bar & Grille,1.0,NEGATIVE

"I ordered the smoked salmon BLT. It comes on marbled rye with arugula, bacon, tomato, and purple onions. Normally, I ask for no onions but I forgot.

We also had the crispy chick peas. They were crisp and spicy. They were like a tastier version of popcorn. I can see this becoming a favorite snack.

"Simply Pho is located on the corner of Dale Mabry and Fletcher in a strip mall that houses a lot of other business so there is plenty of parking. If you're in this area, it's a great place to grab some Vietnamese food. I wouldn't say it is ideal for big groups though. We went with a group of 8 and had no issues being seated, but that's probably all they can accommodate since the rest of the seating is made up of small tables and  booths. 

Other than that, the food was really good. I ordered the beef short rib rice platter which came with 3 pieces of short rib.

"Very disappointing visit to Bar Asia today.  When we arrived it became clear that the place had only one person acting as server and bartender.  But three people in the kitchen and the menu is bowls and sushi, etc so how long could the food possibly take?  Well, it took over an hour and we had to ask for ours to go because we were late to an appointment.  The table behind us was about to leave but right as they were deciding, an appetizer came out so they didn't have to go hungry forever. 
I will note that the bartender/server, Krystal, was great.  She was quick with refills and kept apologizing for the slowness of the food.  Not her fault and I appreciate her service. 
While sitting and waiting, I saw a post on the Bar Asia Facebook page advertising to come have brunch/lunch today.  I commented on the post that they should have another server as we had been waiting for food for nearly an hour.  The restaurant DELETED my post.  So I posted again with a screenshot of the original post.  DELETED again!  I tried to review them on Facebook and they even blocked me from their page.  Seriously?  A simple message to me would have made all the difference in the world.  Explain what happened, apologize, invite me back. 

So I took to my own Facebook page.  Within minutes people were telling of similar experiences and several sent me the link from the Times review last week.  A terrible review, highlighting many of the issues we experienced.  You'd think on the tail of that kind of a review they would be prepared for a South Tampa Sunday lunch.  No. 
Once we were finally able to eat our food, it was just average.  Mine was white rice and vegetables.  Nothing special.  They only gave me a spoonful of sauce so it was very bland.  I was hopeful that the food would at least have made the awful experience a little better.  Also, sushi prices were outrageous.  Almost all of the rolls were $15 and over.  What?!?!  Go to Soho Sushi, Yoko's, Matoi or Kelp before Bar Asia.

The Tom Yum Noodle Soup has a spicy and Sour broth with a good amount of seafood in it . All three dishes are around $7 and will fill you up for sure. If you prefer a more spicy taste, then ask for their peppers on the side. Caution: these peppers are authentic and will burn .

"2.5 Stars

Decent pizza, but certainly not the best in the area.  What they do have going for them is that they deliver for free, if you're within a few miles.

The first time I ordered their pizza, I liked it, although I thought it was odd that the toppings of tomato and spinach were under the top coating of cheese.  The pizza was delivered barely warm that time.

Months go by, and I decide to order from them again.  They have an excellent on-line order form.  The form said that delivery would be in 50 minutes. The form also had a spot to leave a tip, and while I HATE to leave a tip before I get service, I didn't know if there would be another opportunity, so I did.  I completed the check-out, and received a confirmation email saying that the pizza would be there in 60 minutes. 75 minutes go by, and I finally receive my pizza and wings. When I go to sign the form, there is an ""additional tip"" line.  I wonder how many people they scam into leaving a 2nd tip, not realizing the person that ordered it already left one??

Needless to say, both the pizza and the wings I ordered were completely cold. Which is hilarious when you realize that I am 2.2 miles away from the store. Once heated up it was good, although I do feel they are pretty skimpy on the toppings.

We had probably about 10 people in our party, but let's just say I felt that most of the night we were serving ourselves and they just took the order, brought out the food, and cleaned up (after we left). We constantly had to go find our servers, ask about our food, fill our own water (since there was a pitcher of water nearby), and get the bill so we can leave. We had the korean BBQ and some regular items, but to make things short and simple. The korean BBQ was not worth the price and it didn't taste all that great, and what is up with the electric grill....and when they tell you each portion is meant for one person only, they weren't kidding...The only thing that was actually good out of the many items we ordered was Dol Sot Bi Bim Bap.

"Sabor Paisa means flavor Paisa, the flavor of the Colombian state of Paisa. The different states of Colombia have different cuisines. The Paisa region is known for the city of Medellin and coffee growing, Juan Valdez is a prototypical Paisa. 

The menu here also uncludes some Peruvian dishes, lomo saltado and arroz chaufa (Peruvian fried rice) for example, as well as dishes from other regions of Colombia.

Probably because of the drug wars and civil war centered around Medellin, many Colombians left home and there are several Paisa bakeries and restaurants in Tampa especially on and around  Armenia Ave.

The hot chocolate is good here and everything I've tried is tasty. It's not a ritzy area and it's not a ritzy place. But it's fun to try.

The people next to me had a casuela de mariscos, a kind of creamy seafood stew, so I got it too. I was impressed. 

Bandeja paisa, a platter with rice, beans, egg, thin steak, spicy sausage (chorizo), corn discs (arepa) and fried pork belly (chicharron) is a Paisa specialty. I like it with avocado but it doesn't seem to come that way often. It's a hearty meal!

Kick back, try a Colombiana cream soda type soda or an apple soda (soda de manzana) or an Aguilar beer or aguardiente (firewater) and enjoy.

"I want to like this place a lot more, I really do. I mean anywhere that offers completely vegan takeout should be five stars in my book. So what's the problem?

First, I'll start with what's not the problem. This small hole-in-the-wall store is completely filled with vegan items. Some of these are items I've seen at Whole Foods, Nutrition S'Mart, Chuck's, Trader Joe' s or Abby's, and some of them I've  never seen before (different brands of salmon patties, tuna and fried chicken just to name a few). Items for sale include canned goods, frozen foods, condiments, snacks, baking items, spices, homemade baked goods and fresh smoothies. All of these seemed to be priced pretty close to your local health food stores like Chuck's, Abby's or Nutrition S'Mart.

Our original reason for visiting was to order some take out. The menu was hard to find (it was behind you when you walk in, not on a big sign over by where you order). Once I found the menu, I asked for a tofu wrap. The wrap was full of fresh veggies and nicely textured tofu. The tofu was some of the best I've had recently. I loved that the sandwich could be topped with any number of vegan condiments including chipotle mayo. I opted for plain old mustard since my daughter was sharing it with me. Speaking of my daughter, that child started crying from hunger while we waited for our sandwich to be made. What did the employees do? They offered her a homemade carob cookie absolutely free. The crying immediately stopped (hmmm...maybe I should teach her to cry on command so we can get more free stuff) and a huge smile spread across her face.

The owner of the shop was very knowledgeable. She took me on a tour of the store, talked to me about the products, shared which ones were vegan and not (they have like three or four things in the store that have eggs in them) and gave me recommendations based on customer feedback and popularity. Not sure if you like something? Instead of buying an entire box, Natural Detox/Vegan Take Out will sell them in smaller increments. Buy only two vegan chicken patties or nuggets instead of an entire box. That's something I've never seen before.

So why only three stars? Well, the reason I needed a tour of the store is because nothing is labelled. You'd find the same products at two different places in the shop. The refrigerators aren't clear, so you have to open them to see inside. Then you stand there looking around and rearranging things. All the while energy is being wasted unnecessarily.

The owner did apologize a lot and kept saying she was in the process of defrosting refrigerators. I'll give them a few weeks and then stop back in. With a few simple tweaks, like better organization and labels on the outside of the refrigerators telling you what's inside, this store would easily be a four or even five star one.",19,B,Natural Detox Nutrition Shoppe,Natural Detox Nutrition Shoppe,Natural D3tox Nutrition Shopp3,3.0,NEGATIVE

Espresso is somewhat average and so is the food but it's just good enough to make this a great addition to the Westchase slate of coffee shops, bakeries, restaurants and bars. The staff is very good, hard working and attentive, one of the Tiger's best features, they have good indoor and outdoor seating and it doesn't feel anywhere near as crowded nor corporate / sterile as the vacated Starbuck's. Love the walkup, neighborhood vibe and the corner coffee shop inconsistency.

"""Yay! I'm a fan"" perfectly sums up my experience at Zydeco. I had the day off from work and because all of my friends work the old 9-5 Mon-Fri schedule, I went by my lonesome. I walked into a new, clean, and fairly empty brewery around 2:30 on a Tuesday and was greeted by a friendly and chill bartender named Mike. I asked about happy hour times and he said they didn't have that set-up yet (a bummer and the only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars) but he did offer me a ""locals"" discount which was very generous. I ordered a flight based on Mike's recommendations and was blown away by the beer. The red ale was excellent but what really took the cake was the ""Champagne Wishes and Caviar Dreams."" It weighs in at a whopping 7% but is as light and fluffy as a light domestic beer or unsurprisingly, a dry champagne. I ordered a pint of that after I downed the flight and my total was $15 before the locals discount. The food looked good but I was on a liquid diet at the time so I did not indulge. I will be back.

This appears to be a family operation, and the people could not have been friendlier.

The Rapid Pick-Up option is awesome.  It's always ready when I expect it and they have designated parking spots for that service.  There are only 2 spots, but only once was one not available to park at.  So no complaints about waiting in line.

"Really nice new indoor/outdoor spot that is easy walking distance from the University of Tampa baseball stadium.

I knew this place would be worthwhile because it comes from the same quality guy that has spent years at various good spots in the early Channelside days, the original Lee Roy Selmon's and then in South Tampa. Many of the South Tampa crowd has already followed him here based on what I've seen and they haven't even done the ""official"" grand opening yet.

There's plenty of draft and bottle beer options at both the main bar and the ""sidecar bar,"" plus wine and full liquor as is to be expected. 

For you day-drinkers, their Happy Hour runs 1130am - 7pm every Monday thru Friday and I'm also hearing of some ridiculously good $2 deals on drafts and Fireball shots once the real Monday Night Football games start.

The menu features many quality choices for appetizers, salads, mac and cheese specialty dishes each day, sandwiches, fish tacos as well as tots/fries with your choice of about ten different seasonings. 

Seems like virtually everyone loves the burger here and both the meatball or meatloaf sliders made me happy as well. Not many places offer a quality brat and Station Grill features that on the menu too. Oh, and the house made ranch sauce that comes with the chicken tenders, jalapeño bottle caps or friend avocado bites is a signature item in its own right. Just ask for a taste and you'll see what I mean.

Easy place to drink and/or eat and/or chill and/or watch the Rays or upcoming college or pro football from virtually anywhere indoors or outdoors at the bar or any table. There are 15 tables inside and about ten tables outside and nice girls working all over the place.

"Coming from a small town in Southeast Missouri, I regularly went to a family-owned, family-run Thai restaurant.  The food was authentic.  More importantly, the people were very warm and welcoming.  I was sad when I left this in MIssouri, however, the family at Café de Siam welcomed me with the same hospitality.  

I ate the massaman beef and the curry puffs.  The beef was creamy and rich, as I expected.  Authentic.  Curry puffs were awesome! It was amazing how the recipe from Café N' Me in Missouri and this Café de Siam were surprisingly similar in both texture and taste.  Maybe famililes were from the same region in Thailand, perhaps?  

With all of this hospitality I couldn't help but be reminded of my grandparents back in Malaysia as the lady was serving me.

"One of the regulars at Al's BBQ told me about this soul food restaurant that serves really good food and is only open on Sundays. I trust his judgment since we're both big fans of Al's so I decided to check it out today. If I wasn't told about the restaurant, I would never been able to find it because it's tucked in a residential neighborhood in an area I rarely venture to. So it's fitting that I ""discovered"" Food 4 The Soul on the day before Columbus Day. And just like America was already ""discovered"" before Columbus did, Food 4 the Soul was already known by at least one Yelper.  

Food 4 the Soul is located in a bright orange house that was converted into a restaurant. I was a little surprised when I walked in at how small the place is. Just 4-5 tables that seats about 20 and you walk up to a little window and place your order. When I came in, there were a few customers waiting for their order, which was surprising to me because the place had just opened. It was very evident that the restaurant is popular with the after church crowd as a steady stream of people in their Sunday best came in. 

I ordered the turkey wings, with a side of mac and cheese and cornbread dressing and homemade ""fruity tea"" to wash it down. When I saw the lady notify a customer that they don't have yams and are replacing it with sweet potato souffle, I called an audible and asked if I could switch my cornbread dressing to the souffle, which turned out to be one of the best decisions I made this year.  After a long wait (25 min at least), I was starting to get restless. Fortunately, the food was well worth the wait. And usually I would knock off a star for that but that just goes to show you how good it was for me to give 5 stars.  The portion size was huge, like two meals. I didn't realize that the turkey wings would come on a bed of rice (plus cornbread). Everything was awesome but the sweet potato souffle was the star of the show. Very sweet but very delicious. I'm not sure how often they have this on the menu, as the menu seems to change weekly but it's definitely worth a shot to ask for it if you don't see it on the menu. So impressed with my meal that I decided to try out their red velvet cake. Again, awesome. 

And the ladies and gentleman working there were really nice, asking what my name is, asking how everything was, holding the door open for me as I left, ""come back to see us"", etc.  Without a doubt, I will.",9,A,Food 4 The Soul Diner & Bakery,Food 4 The Soul Diner & Bakery,Food 4 Th3 Soul Din3r & Bak3ry,5.0,POSITIVE

"So nice to have another healthy option close by! I love a healthy bowl or salad and this cafe has it...along with tacos! 

I heard about the grand opening today (March 5, 2019) from a Facebook event that popped up on my feed. On my way home from the airport post office I decided to stop in to grab lunch. The owner, Debbie who is a sweetheart and a fellow Westchase resident was working the register and assisted me with the options on the menu. Everything is 'build your own' and you can create a bowl, a taco or a salad. I was happy to see sweet potato noodles and zoodles on the menu as bases. There are also bowl, taco and salad suggestions if you can't figure out what to create.

I created 2 bowls: 

HubbyStanks Bowl:  Sweet Potato noodles, Quinoa, Roasted Brussel Sprouts, Chick Peas, Grilled Steak (grass fed), & Mediterranean Olive sauce. I also added and extra: Avocado Half

My Bowl: Sweet Potato Noodles, Zoodles, Mashed Cauliflower, Roasted Sweet Potatoes, Garlic Lemon Shrimp (wild caught), and I chose Curry Coconut sauce. 

I want to note that my bowl didn't need sauce when I was eating it. Everything is seasoned and tasty on its own that I just used the curry coconut as a dip for my shrimp.

So while I waited for my bowl Debbie asked if I wanted to try her house made Queso (a family recipe) and freshly made tortilla chips. Why of course I said yes! I raved about the combo. The chips are thin and, crispy and seasoned perfectly! I can eat them alone, however the warm queso was amazing! Debbie then brought me some pico and guac to try as I waited. She explained to me how everything is freshly made and NON-GMO. This is important to me because I love food and restaurants, but because I eat mostly non-gmo or organic at home, I try to limit the amount I eat out because most restaurants are using standard ingredients. 

I ordered the hibiscus iced tea and the person who made the tea told me that it's actually hibiscus and blueberry. Hello! 2 favorites in one tea. I want to point out that I was handed an individually wrapped straw and when I popped the straw out it was paper. Now, I know that it's good for the environment, but I have been recently disappointed by many Tampa Bay restaurants who provide cheap paper straws that fall apart after a few sips. This straw held up perfectly! It's quite sturdy and I'm a slow drinker (I can babysit a drink for 2 hours or so) and the straw never fell apart! Did I mention it was individually wrapped? I know, such a small detail, but I appreciate it being the germophobe that I am!

After trying the chips, queso, guac and pico I can't wait to go back this week and build tacos! (or create nachos if they'll let me)

I really hope Nature's Cafe & Pantry does well here. It's close enough for me to pop in for a healthy lunch or dinner when I'm too busy to cook. My only wish is that it continues to use quality ingredients. So many restaurants in the area lose business once they slack on quality. The restaurant's location on Memorial Hwy hasn't been so lucky. This used to be the spot Thai Gourmet (who later changed to Noodle Kitchen) and more recently Azteca Rojo was located. Fingers crossed.

The pricing is reasonable for the quality of ingredients. $9 for a Bowl, $7 for 2 tacos and $8 for salad. Ingredients, pricing, taste and quality are comparable to Fresh Kitchen IMO...it's just closer to me!

I had driven by this place several times and had been wanting to check it out. I stopped in on a Saturday morning for some coffee and ordered the café con leche and some buttered Cuban toast. The service was extremely slow for what was ordered. The coffee was ok..I've had better. The buttered Cuban toast was not on authentic Cuban bread.

"We love our restaurant street at old height. This restaurant I have bookmark for some time. I love the creative chef went out their own and have their independent restaurant. This business owner did a good job for themselves. We were here on Friday night late after 8 pm. There were seats in this restaurant. The seating area is limited. Very nice clean bathroom. 

Tonight we order three small plate. The escargot, the sear blue fin tuna, and the mussel. The escargot is seat on the bread and pour in wine sauce. It make it perfect when they are soak. The escargot is in good size and they about 10 pieces. Sauce is about the right touch for the escargot. The mussel come with creamy sauce. It is a good dish to pickup not over power the material. 

I like the tuna the best. This a blue fin tuna in belly section. It is a bit fatter and rich in taste. They are likely seared top with a bit soy sauce with fragrant  taste and lay over a special chili sauce. 

The price for the small plate is good. The price of the large plate in about the medium to high side. Not much of seating area but good enough for the night.",28,C,The Olde Heights Bistro,The Olde Heights Bistro,the olde heights bistro,5.0,POSITIVE
"So the obvious joke would be to suggest this place change its name to Yesjaks. Because any time I am thinking about  where I want to eat I will undoubtedly think to go here. Yes, please. 

The truth is that whatever the name, and there is nothing wrong with Nojaks, the food is no joke. I have been searching far too long, and in far too many wrong directions, to find a tasty veggie burger. This, Is. It.

Everything about it just worked. The presentation is not messy or sloppy but neat and really well constructed. The aroma, texture and taste are, in my humble opinion, transcending. I don't often eat meat but do remember how good a really good burger can be. And this rekindled that memory.

Located on a downtown side street with little to distinguish it except that it is just around the corner fro the infamous Hub bar and the historic Tampa Theatre, it might be easily overlooked but make the effort to find it and try it.

Place your order, pay for what you requested, pick it up and take it away. Nice and easy. There is a burger made with tofu and another featuring grass-fed beef so pick your preference and enjoy. All are served on a house made potato roll that is the perfect accompaniment for these sandwiches. 

Sides are available and the beverage selection includes sodas, natural wine, beer, cold brew/cold brew latte * oat and H2O and fizzy H2O.

Love having a place like this that provides quick service, is convenient to where I live - and anywhere in downtown Tampa - and makes it easy to get really enjoyable, and really healthful, food.

Maybe the name should be changed to Gojaks! As in, what are you waiting fo? Just go!",12,A,Nojaks Tasty Foods,Nojaks Tasty Foods,N0jaks Tasty F00ds,5.0,POSITIVE
"Nothing fancy but tasty, consistently high quality food -- breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Highly recommend if you are looking for a clean, mid-priced meal or dessert. 

Restaurant has been in south Tampa a long time but was recently renovated. Service can be less than speedy during peak periods (due to the kitchen backlog), but not so bad to keep you from coming back. 

Free pie slice on Wednesdays:  not all pies, but still a great deal. Note:  the restaurant will be more crowded on Wednesday night because of the pie freebie.

It was great to see Yelp Tampa Bay represented in the wonderful dance performances that included Tina K. (a.k.a. Tinokios) and Kat. They did sets of traditional Greek dances in traditional clothes and a racier sailor attire dance set. Both were superb. Tina stole the show.. ;)

There were also jewelry, t-shirt, and souvenir vendors. A silent auction. And lots of friendly Greeks. There were church tours and a kids play area. A great selection of drinks, leaded and unleaded, as well as fun bands performing.

Lemon Sherry Chicken Breast with Red Potato Mash | Roasted Carrots | Steamed Broccoli | Lemon Sherry Cream Sauce 8/10 tasty but bland. Had to add hot sauce and spices 

Cilantro Turkey Bowl with Lean Ground Turkey | Cilantro | Spinach | Brown Rice | Herb Hemp Sauce 7/10 very bland but loaded with protein. 

Egg Roll in a Bowl with Ground Turkey | Carrots | Peas | Cabbage | Peppers | Green Onion | Brown Rice 9/10 tasty but bland so I added some spices.

Beef Mac n Cheese with Ground Beef | Jalapeño | Roasted Red Pepper | House-made Four Cheese Sauce

"I was recently invited to a Yelp event at the Longhorn Steakhouse. I had never been to a Longhorn Steakhouse so I didn't really know what to expect. Someone told me it was similar to a Salt Grass but they throw peanuts on the floor. When I arrived I was pleasantly surprised by a much classier atmosphere.  I think people are getting Texas Steakhouse and Longhorn Steakhouse confused. Do not mistake the two...they are completely different.

From the moment I walked in the door the staff treated me like a celebrity.  Our group was seated at a cozy little section that was perfect for a group of 20.  The waitress first brought us out hot bread with butter. Next we were served Wild West Shrimp and Grilled White Cheddar Stuffed Mushrooms.  I still cannot make up my mind which one was my favorite.  They were both delish. Then came a Strawberry Pecan Salad. I am not one for fruit on my salad but this salad full of strawberries, oranges, grapes, purple onion, pecans and blue cheese, topped with raspberry vinaigrette had a wonderful flavor. For my steak and side, I chose the Renegade Sirloin and loaded baked potato. When we were served our steak the staff came out with bowls of spices and herbs and simmered a steak sauce on the table. The steak was great alone but I couldn't resist dipping every other bite of steak in the sauce. It was really good.  I wasn't sure if I could eat dessert until they sat the Chocolate Stampede in front of me. What a treat!  It is like a magical hunk of chocolate goodness with vanilla ice cream with more chocolate drizzled all over the plate.

Hopefully that sheds some light on the state I am in when I eat here. It's ALWAYS good. But it's ALWAYS after 1:00AM and I'm NEVER sober. And neither are most people around you, so you won't feel like the lone drunk.

The outdoor seating options are my favorite. I prefer to dine on what I like to call ""curb pizza"". I sit on the curb and try to avoid being run over. If a table is available, I will take it and watch the half-naked boys at the gay bar next door strut their packages.

"We get dinner from Kwan Ming at least once a week; it's THE place to go for Chinese take out. The dishes are authentic and very delicious. Many of the sauces and soups start with homemade chicken stock that give a real depth of flavor. They also make their own duck sauce, chile oil and Chinese mustard.
 Some of my family's favorite starters are the Kwan Ming Shrimp Egg Roll and the Sliced Roast Pork Hong Kong Style. The House Special fried rice was the first dish we ever tried; we were hooked from the start. But where they really excell is the sauces. The Kwan Ming House Special, the Kwan Ming Double Squashes w.Mushroom (I like to add pork with it), and the Pork with Garlic   Sauce exemplify the flavorful sauces that meld soy (which the owner blends himself),  ginger, garlic and the homemade stock without being cloying and thick. The General Tso's Chicken has a beautifully fresh flavor that my wife loves. She also adds extra zing to it with the homemade Chinese mustard. The Lobster with Ginger special they have offered recently is subtle and sublime, showing the care and expertise of the chef. 
 It's always best to order ahead, but you will miss out on the huge variety of fish offerings that need to be added to the online menu.

"I found out about Viitals from Groupon many months ago.  I quickly jumped at the chance to get half off vegan baked goods.  Who wouldn't? Too bad I let the coupon expire before I got to stuff my face with $20 worth of cupcakes (for only $10!).  My body says thanks and wants to remind the general public that just because a cookie is vegan, doesn't make it healthy.  I have to remind Dave of that often.

But that isn't always true.

At Viitals, there is a small, but varied selection of vegan baked goods - cookies, cupcakes, macaroons, muffins and breads.

I was looking for a meal not just sweets when I landed at Viitals.  After reading less than stellar reviews online, I was prepared for what was to come.  I decided to give them a try anyways and decide for myself.  Plus, any restaurant that caters to vegans deserves my business.

I arrived at Viitals which is situated between a deli and an upscale pizza joint in a strip mall off of Dale Mabry.  The atmosphere is crisp and clean - a nice mix of modern and comfort.  There is free wifi and a nice selection of health books to browse as well.

I studied the menu online before my arrival, so I knew exactly what I wanted - the Unexpected.  Kinda ironic, eh?

The owner warned me that the sandwich was small, but I knew this already as an online reviewer warned me too!  I asked for a side salad, chips, fruit, anything, and he told me to go next store for a salad.  Mm, okay.  What's with the big salad on the front page of your website?

I decided to eat the sandwich sans side and then come back for a treat.

The Unexpected wasn't anything exceptional.  When I eat a sandwich I prefer it overflowing of fresh vegetables versus being lost among the bread.  Unfortunately this was the later.  The bread was rather sweet which makes sense considering Viitals is a bakery.

The Unexpected wasn't quite filling enough for me to call lunch over, so I went back for round two.  Next up, was a coconut-poppy seed macaroon.

I'm not one to count calories, but I always like to know what's in my food.  One great thing about Viitals is that the nutrition information is listed for all of their items. So for 160 calories, 5 g of protein and 5 g of fiber, this little treat hit the spot.  I could have used a few more consider my sandwich was only 270 calories.  I'm not very good at math, but 270 + 160 = way too little calories to consider this lunch a done deal.

So, I went home and made a smoothie.

While I can't say I'll be back to enjoy another meal at Viitals, I will be back for a cupcake.

Soup/ Sandwich combo- French Dip & French Onion (Bonjour!)

We both ordered identically and inhaled our lunches! Savory, delish...nice portions & we were both interested in more (Oliver Twist? Please sir...more?).

Customer service was grand! The gentleman (manager? owner?) who took our order welcomed us, asked about our previous dining experience and thanked us for coming in. He then came by the table later to see how we were enjoying our meals & this place was hopping.

"Junmai Station is a new Japanese takeaway spot in downtown Tampa at the bottom of the new Hyatt Place/Hyatt House. It is by the same duo that runs Ebisu Sushi Shack, so I expected good things. I wasn't disappointed! This eatery specializes in onigiri, which are scrumptious rice balls that are often in triangular shape and have various fillings. For my first visit, I got the shake (salted salmon $3.95) , shiso ume (shiso leaf & plum $3.50), tsukune (chicken meatball $4.25), and the rainbow (which is a whole plethora of ingredients $5.25). The shake and shiso ume were absolutely perfect! They were warm, delicious explosions of flavor in my mouth that were somehow so comforting. The shiso ume in particular, while the flavors were unfamiliar, was a real treat. Definitely try this one out if they have it! 
A selection of donburi (rice bowls) are also available, so I will try one of those next time. They only have a few seats at the window, so it's primarily a grab-and-go kind of place.

"Visited 5/1/2016. They advertised  $.59 Krystal burgers, $.79 Krystal with cheese and $.99 Krystal chicken between  2 and 5PM. At 4:20PM, I attempted to order several of each. They informed me that a computer managed the sale prices and it was offline so they were unable to honor the price that was displayed in the window. The computer that charged full price was just fine though. I asked if a manager could adjust the price manually. They replied no. So I advised I would not pay the elevated price, and I left.

I stopped by with my boyfriend around 11pm on a Sunday. The place was empty except one worker who was very helpful and friendly. She was well versed in all of their products and happy to explain everything to us. While their menu had so many different options that sounded delicious, we wanted to try it straight our first time to see what it's all about. My boyfriend got a double ""shell"" of kava (aka bula basic) and I got the same thing but with the coconut creamer (at the workers recommendation). The taste is definitely nothing to drool over. It really does taste like dirty, exactly as the worker told us it would. I actually did like it with the creamer however. It cuts the bitterness without covering the taste. We both took our sweet time sipping on our shells while sitting in the rope swings. The atmosphere is very zen and inviting. Overall I had a great experience and look forward to coming back to try other kava drinks as well as giving kraton and their CBD drinks a try!

"I was happy to see this restaurant reopened after several months closed from COVID. The hostess was too busy with her phone to do more than shoo us towards the seating area. The waitress told the crab legs and supper extras are extra fee, ok.. We found the food worse than before, half warm and very old from setting out too long. The soups had thick film coating, and most of the entree items shrunken from age and rewarmed too many times. We had to ask twice for the tool to crack crab legs, but obviously the waitress was correct and no need...as I've never had crab so over cooked the entire shells were soft and cracking tool certainly of no use. Even with low customers, the waitress difficult to flag down for needs. The male worker totally ignored customers, only concerned with watching every move of the female waitress. We found enough to eat and called it quits....already decided to never come here again, but the worst shock was yet to come. Obviously for their down time and lack of customers, they scandalously have upgraded their prices. I can only wish I were joking, but credit card statements can verify $110 and change for two weeknight dinners with crab additions. First of all we will never go to this establishment again. If you want to spend $110, highly recommend going two doors down to Mr and Mrs Crab... or just save a lot of money and go 2 minutes down the road to Panda Express, or even McDonalds.

"This place is awesome...like going back in time! When my wife and I were getting our bike trailer tuned up at Velo Champ, I noticed that a little bakery had popped up next door. Mikey's had a window-full of wedding cakes that looked like contenders for yet another Food Network reality show. But down in the corner sat a bottle of Cheerwine...and that is what made me stop and go inside.

We had our 18 month old with us so once we were in the door there was no turning back. Mikey's is a charming bakery cafe with an elaborate display case and lots of antique accessories that were so appropriately well placed that I might have thought that we stepped back in time for a minute...back to a Seminole Heights soda fountain in the 30s or 40s. In actuality, I found out they just opened last Wednesday! Our son walked right up to the case and insisted that he must partake.

Much to my pleasure, there was a semi-familiar sight. Many of the gourmet concoctions resembled French pastries. After living for a few months in the south of France, I grew an addiction to Pain au Chocolat. Sure enough there on the bottom rack my little son was pointing right at them. Well done my boy!

Of course these did not feign to be authentic...just amazingly good as the ribbons hanging from the case attest to. There was a label announcing that they were chocolate croissants. And that they truly were. Unlike their French twins, they didn't leave anything to the imagination as they were oozing out the sides with chocolate. In fact, after ordering one (served warm) I determined that it was 50% chocolate at least. Yummy, and the flakiness/tender thickness of the rectangular croissant was almost right on.

My wife and I determined it was time for lunch and promptly ordered their Southern Philly on Cuban Bread. And watch out Geno's...this cheesesteak was gooood! What makes it Southern I suppose is the thin spread of delicious peppercorn ranch dressing that compliments the juicy roast beef, green peppers, onion, and provolone melting in your mouth on that fresh soft cuban bread.

Did I mention that they also had two shelves of pies (including a gooey pecan) which means I am going to have to bypass the chocolate croissant next time? When I return, I'll try one of their homemade soups too, like Tomato Basil or Chicken n'Dumplings.

"The smoke drew me in...

Great BBQ joint in Brandon. Line was long when arrived for lunch this saturday but it went quick. I like the idea you can see where your food is coming from. Watching the meat being chopped fresh. 

I ordered the combo platter and a drink. I had Chicken and Pork with beans and fries with some bread. The sauce is good no doubt about that. I wish they had a spicy version or even a mustard sauce but I did not see any. The chicken was good but a little dry. The pork was flavorful and moist. The sauce made the meal. The beans were ok, probably order something else next time. The fries were fresh, not very crispy. 

All in all the food was good, definitely will be back to try the corn beef.",29,C,First Choice Southern Bar-B Que,First Choice Southern Bar-B Que,First Choice Southern Bar-B Que Inc.,3.0,POSITIVE
"So disappointed.  Been there twice before and thought it was fairly good. Then went there last Friday afternoon for a late lunch and I ordered a Corned Beef on Rye and Hubby had a Pastrami on Rye. After our waiter took our drink order he disappeared for 10 minutes. We had to ask for him and the other waiter said oh he was doing his side work because his shift is over. Wait, what? Then when the food finally arrived we got SCRAPS on STALE RYE BREAD, with a side of STALE CHIPS. I asked for a manager and he told us the bread is made fresh daily. AAANNDD??? That was all he said. When I told the waiter I wasn't sure which was more stale the bread or the chips, he said ""The Chips!"" NEVER AGAIN!

"I love trying new restaurants so when a friend of mine told me about this place and after seeing all the pictures of course I wanted to go! I went for a belated birthday dinner for me with my sisters. First impressions when walking though the door was that the decor was beautiful but was overshadowed by the volume of the music, I felt like I had to shout in order for my sisters to hear me. As for my experience there were a few things that put me off about this restaurant. First off I used the Open Table app to create my reservation earlier that day to ensure we got seats and did not have to wait. When my party arrived (small party of 4) we waited an extra 30 minutes before we were seated. Secondly, our server did not seem very knowledgeable about the menu or the wines they offered. In addition as she was filling our glasses with water she accidentally split water on my sisters phone. Accidents happen that is understandable, but what aggravated me the most was that she continued to fill the glass while spilling water on her phone and said verbatim ""oh its a LifeProof case it's ok"". Without any apology she walked away. That in itself is completely rude. Thirdly, the food was not at all what I was expecting. I ordered the Baked Lobster & Crab Rotolo. In my opinion the pasta was too thick and the overall taste was average, not worth the price. In fact the only part of my meal I enjoyed was the bread they brought out to the table. Overall I felt like I was paying for the ambiance, not worth a second trip.",16,B,Sacred Pepper,Sacred Pepper,S@cred Pepper,2.0,NEGATIVE

"I've eaten here twice now, and both times I have loved it.  Helpful tips for a newbie:  order at the counter, get a number, claim a table.  Grab your silverware and extra napkins at the counter where the soda machine is.  If you need to-go containers or a lid for your soda cup, you need to ask a person behind the counter.  I've just saved you countless steps, so you totally owe me.  Oh, and the light switch for the women's restroom is hidden below the towel dispenser; you're welcome.

My favorite sandwich (and yes, I've had it both visits) is the Rustica- grilled chicken, prosciutto, mozzarella, tomatoes, pesto, balsamic vinegar, all on focaccia.   Served with homemade potato chips.   To me, this sandwich is the perfect combo of flavors-sweet, salty, fresh, and tasty.  My first visit I also tried the salted caramel cake off the May specials menu.  It was incredibly moist and delicious.  This last visit I split the roasted portabella stack appetizer with my friend, also off the May specials list, and both of us couldn't stop raving about how great it was.  Again, it was the combination of flavors they have married together: mushroom, goat cheese, spinach, mozzarella, arugula, pine nuts, and dressing.  Served warm, and really outstanding.

"I've ordered take out from here twice now. Once on a Friday and once on a random weeknight. I have to say I don't plan on ordering here again, mostly because I feel like I'm always disappointed by their rolls. I've gotten one of their tuna rolls twice now, a California roll, lobster tempura roll, and the volcano roll. 
Decent California roll, nothing special to rave about. 
And their lobster roll was good, at least the outside of it was warm, but the rest was kind of cold....
Volcano roll was great, plenty of crab on this roll, and the avocado on it wasn't the freshest, but it tasted fine (it had inklings of the black parts of an avocado going bad). Their raw tuna has been the most disappointing, it's always mushy and has a heavy fishy smell, which I know if it's fresh, it shouldn't be. 
First time I ordered, rice was warm, and it was readily prepared, took only 15mins to wait for two rolls. 
Second time, same quick service, but really cold rice and fish, I was disappointed.
I'd come again to try their specialty rolls, and their volcano is very popular, but I don't plan on getting raw rolls from here. I don't like salmon, and their tuna is just too disappointing for me.

"Michaels has been one of our most favorite restaurants to go to for years. We always look forward to the treat of dining here. 
Not sure if the ownership changed but the service was not at all what we have been accustomed to. We were ignored for 15-20 minutes after being seated. Twice they tried to deliver food to us that belonged to other customers while still not acknowledging us. They finally determined we had not been served at all and then began the process. I had the salmon Rockefeller which had a red sauce that definitely did not compliment the fish along with a quinoa mix that equally did not blend with the other flavors . Disappointing but we shall return as we would hate to give up our favorite based on one mediocre experience. Not at all, however, what we expected. Update: thank you Michael for your response and offer. We had no intention of wanting anyone to lose their job over one mistake. Equally, we have no expectation of free meals.

"Went here for breakfast today. Ordered an omelette with crispy scattered hash-browns.   I sent back the hash-browns because they were uncooked, then they came back scattered but not crispy so the waitress said the home fries are better and deep fried tastes best.  I ordered that thinking it would be diced squares but they were thin slices like potato chips.  I barely ate any of those they tasted burnt.  My omelette was a spinach, broccoli, mushroom, and cheddar with a side of two pieces of bacon and two sausage links. The mushrooms were canned and the sausage links tasted like the frozen precooked kind we used to microwave as kids.  (Not good).  The omelette was OK but fresh mushrooms that were sautéed would've tasted so much better! 

Then to pay you have to have cash which majority of us never have anymore. So I got to pay $2.50 to use their ATM. My bill came to $14.30. Seems like Disney World prices.

We went for broke today and tried a bite or two of everything and I can promise you there is nothing here that is not well prepared and delicious!!! The surprise today for me was the hot and sour soup. I've never been a fan, I've never ordered it, but I tried it today and it was amazing. The variety here for such a small venue is impressive! Spicy crispy chicken, orange beef, General Tso's chicken, Honey chicken, bourbon chicken, Mongolian beef, Bbq spare ribs, spring rolls, chicken and broccoli, served with fried five or lo mein. Everything a round eye who likes Chinese food desires. The staff as always is friendly and helpful and you are always greeted with a smile and you are treated like Ming Dynasty royalty.

We ordered doormet (as we have many nights) thru uber eats - all was well until a small roach crawled out of the salad on my moms plate.

When I finally did call the manager - she asked if I took a picture and proceeded to tell me that they checked the lettuce and there was no sign of any bugs. She wasn't very apologetic.

"Why 5 stars? Because it's a food court of food trucks... what else needs to be said??

   ---   ---   ---

I only wish it could have happened sooner, especially before I just moved away from Seminole Heights :)

A daily gathering of food trucks is something I've seen in other cities, and I was stoked to find out that it was starting up here! I've been twice now, and definitely see the potential for plenty of growth. The concrete is a little beat up, the parking can be lacking, and there's not a ton of places to sit, but they are just getting their start. I think the popularity will continue to grow, which will allow those issues to be taken care of. Rome's food truck court wasn't built in a day!

And for the record, I didn't experience any parking issues during my two visits, but I have heard from others, that when it's crowded, parking can run thin. And I didn't need to worry about places to sit, because I took my food home both times :)

I love the creativity of the themes. I've seen an all Asian food truck day, as well as an Orlando takeover. The latter was my favorite, as I got to experience one of my all-time favorite meals from a food truck - Swede Dish, which will be my next review!",29,C,Generation Food Court Tampa,Generation Food Court Tampa,G3n3ration Food Court Tampa,5.0,NEGATIVE

She thinks it's cute and maybe some people enjoy this type of behavior. Not me. Everyone enjoys a little sass from a little old lady, but this lady was not. She's just a mean ole' hag.

"4.5 stars rounded up! This North Austin-based Ramen eatery first opened in May 2012... as a food truck! It took just a few months for Michi's first Brick & Mortar eatery to open. And in 2015, it earned the honor of ""Best Ramen"" in Austin. At that time, Michi offered two basic broths. One was Miso-based while the other was soy-based. There are currently 3 Austin locations. All the Michi Ramen locations are owned by one man: Fredrick Lee. How's that for trivia! 

This particular Japanese Ramen eatery had the unfortunate luck of having a soft opening in mid March 2020. Just two weeks later, the establishment was closed due to Covid restrictions. That May, it opened only for Takeout, & didn't fully reopen until mid September 2020. I have wanted to stop in for the last 8 months; today was the day, & I was NOT disappointed.

This Japanese Ramen restaurant has a most interesting menu: 16 appetizers that range in price from $4.50 (Edamame & Shumai) to $9.50 (Soft Shell Crab). I tried two appetizers: the $6.95 Fried Chicken Wings w/ Sweet Thai Chili Sauce & the $5.95 pan seared pork Gyoza. The Gyoza was VERY GOOD (see pic), but the Fried Chicken Wings were unimpressive. Although they had a nice flavor & the Thi Chili Sauce was excellent, the wings were overly breaded-- see pic. (I; however, am normally not a big fan of most fried foods, so I may not be the best critic.)

The menu also includes 2 soups (Miso & Clear) & 5 salads, w/ the most expensive salad the $6.95 Ika Sansai (squid & Japanese veggies).

If a Ramen entree is not on your culinary agenda, there are 3 available Bowls: Braised Pork ($13.95); Gyu ($15.95); & Eel @ $17.95. 

Last, but definitely not least, are the namesake bowls: 7 Ramen offerings that include my MISO bowl that included flour noodles; ground pork; sliced pork chashu; scallions; chives; cilantro; bean sprouts; & a half soft boiled egg-- all in a ""rich golden chicken broth."" I opted for ""Regular"" seasoning, but Spicy Oil & Paste, as well as Black Garlic were also available. SEE PIC of my INCREDIBLE Ramen-- seriously, just $13.95! SEE MENU PICS to read what the 6 other bowls include! Curry Seafood Ramen, the most expensive Ramen dish @ $16.95 is on my culinary bucket list. The shrimp; squid; crab leg; scallop; fish cake; & fish balls sound just too good not to order. What I found most impressive about Machi is my taste buds were NOT hijacked by a surplus of sodium, as has been my experience w/ Ramen elsewhere.

Oh, let us not forget the 17 Additional Toppings diners can add to their Ramen. Seven are just $1 each! The most expensive is the Shrimp @ $5.50. For Fried Tofu lovers, adding it will cost you $2. 

Service was EXCELLENT; the friendly  young woman greeted me the moment I walked thru the door. She took my order @ the host/hostess counter before offering me ice water while I waited. While handing my order to me after a short wait, she thanked me multiple times. She appeared genuinely friendly. 

The restaurant has a ""full"" non-alcoholic bar. Some drinks @ the Michi Tea Bar are Peach, Strawberry, Grape, Lycee, Mango, & Passionfruit Yogurt Drink, as well as Milk Tea, Taro Milk Tea, & Macha Milk Tea. 6 Green Teas are also available in all the same flavors as the Yogurt drinks. All sell for $4.50 each.

The restaurant is divided into four sections: The exterior kitchen area that has barstools; the Michi Tea Bar that also offers barstool seating (see pic); the center section w/ wooden tables (see pic), & the Eastside interior wall that has available booth seating. The dining room appeared spotless. However, I was just Patron #3 of the day. 

Michi Ramen is open 7 days weekly. Cash; Mastercard; Visa; Discover; & American Express are accepted methods of payment. This restaurant offers the following options: Dine-in; Order Online; Takeout; Curbside; & Delivery w/ DoorDash; Grubhub; ubereats; & possibly others.

Not only was my Miso Ramen the MOST FLAVORFUL Ramen I've eaten, but it was definitely the least expensive. What a wonderful addition Michi Ramen is to the New Tampa area! I already look forward to returning to try the Curry Seafood Ramen; the Pork Chashu Bun; & just maybe the Eel Rice Bowl! My eyes are definitely larger than my stomach. Lol.

"Decor + Atmosphere + the Atrium + Fountain + the Floors! = My favorite hands down

OE is sexy and they know it! I have not been to any other place remotely close to this in the surrounding area. Not feeling like a meal No problem! The option to have a coffee or tea and sit is there if you want it. They have a book store and a accessory/small items for the home store that is adorable.

I have now been 3 times to this lovely place and when im there i feel like i have been transported to Europe or some delightful vacation space far away. 

First visit I wasn't feeling like breakfast so I tried the Chicken Burger -  avocado, jalapeño, tomato, feta, cumin aioli, toasted bun with sweet potato fries was great! Spicy and very filling for little old me! I could have shared this burger and been fine. 

Second visit, fell in love! I will forever and always order for Brunch -  Lobster Benedict - poached eggs, bacon, biscuit, corn fondue, poblano relish, micro cilantro. Perfectly done and Delicious! This is what dreams are made of people! Huge lobster claws on fresh homemade biscuits I mean come on!!! With the perfectly poached eggs and everything else on top, I have found my dish! 

On my third visit I went with a friend in the afternoon for coffee. We sat on the couches and chatted. Its such a beautiful space! Buddy Brew makes homemade caramel used in their caramel latte. Its the best cup I have had in Tampa by far.

Service is always good never too quick bc they are always busy! No complaints here though there is so much to look at and enjoy while here its always an afterthought.

"Okay where to start...we walked in and the person working looked almost pissed off that we walked in.  No big deal, I get it, work is a drag and I like to give people the benefit of the doubt.  The menu looked fairly tasty so it didn't bother me.  I ordered the gyros pita, a veggie pita, and a cheese pizza.  Fairly simple right? So I get the food, the gyros wasn't bad, but wasn't great either.  Fairly filling but the meat was lukewarm at best.  My wife's veggie pita was good.  Nothing to complain about there.  My son's cheese ""pizza"" was nothing but a pita and cheese sprinkled on it and melted.  No tomato or pizza sauce.  This is where I start to get irked.  I will say, at least the cheese on there was very generous but I wasn't looking for cheesey bread.  

Now, in the middle of eating, the fire alarm went off and continued to go off for 15 minutes.  Not to the owner or workers fault but a simple "" hey sorry about the noise but there's nothing I can do about the alarm"" would have been nice to hear.  He looked miserable sitting behind the counter on his tablet watching YouTube so I just let it be.  Next, I go to refill my drink and decide to get some iced tea.  The second I start to dispense it, a flurry of fruit flies scatter from the spout.  With no joke, about 5 dead fruit flies in my drink cup now.  That's when I was done. Before I left, I was going to take my son to the restroom but my wife said ""he doesn't need to go"".  After we left, she said she didn't want our son using it.

Onion rings were very good, great sized portion and yummy dipping sauce. Fries were good as well. Everything was hot and served at a good pace. 

Our server, Megan, was excellent-prompt, attentive, friendly, but didn't hover. Replenished beverages without needing to ask. (This may seem insignificant, but it's not the norm when we dine out.)

When these first started popping up all over the place, I thought it was kind of weird, but now I understand why they did so. THIS PLACE IS AWESOME.

It is one of the most quick ways, also because you order your food, and then you go over and pay for it, and then your good is ready. I would definitely not rank it in the same league as even a really nice Race Trac, because this place has some food that is actually good. While the Race Trac may look good at first, it will not be maintained as well as a Wawa will, and it will not be near as clean.

"Let me start off by saying the food here is great. My husband and I have been here numerous amount of times and have not been disappointed by the food yet. We have ordered sushi, noodles, curry and sautés. Their food is on the pricier side but it is well worth it. The entrees (not including sushi) come with a healthy portion of meat with a side of rice. This entree can easily feed 1-2 hungry people.  

Why am knocking off a star? The service. The service though friendly is inconsistent. Sometimes the wait is longer than expected or it is too fast. Also the ambiance is a little confusing. The music they play has ranged anywhere from country to old school to top 40. We are a fan of all but it is confusing as to what kind of experience we will expect. 

Overall, come for the food. You will not be disappointed!",36,C,Thai Prime Kitchen & Bar,Thai Prime Kitchen & Bar,thai prime kitchen & bar,4.0,POSITIVE

"Stopped in on a Saturday during lunch time (12:30-1pm)

1st off - Very Clean.. the cleanest I have seen a Vietnamese restaurant

My family is new to the area and we wanted to explore all the different restaurants Brandon and Tampa, FL had to offer.

We saw this open and my husband LOVES Pho so we decided to try and hope to see if it would give me a break from making Pho at home.  My husband had the combination Pho bowl and when he got it, out came the critique... too much oil floating on top, broth was light in color and very bland as well as too sweet (for his taste)  I guess that means I will continue to make Pho at home :) but at $9 for a large bowl for one person I don't mind making it.

My kids had the combination port sandwiches.  My son liked it, but then again he basically likes everything.  My daughter had a more adventurous time with her sandwich... first she accidentally bite into a jalapeno which brought her close to tears (gave use a good laugh) and then after half of her sandwich was eaten, pulled out a few pieces of the pork skin, which still had a few hairs on it!!! She was done.

I had the vermicelli bowl with shrimp.. it was good, but basically it was a spring roll
unwrapped.  No seasonings other than a separate small condiment bowl of sweet n sour sauce which was not nearly enough.

It doesn't look like we will be back to Saigon and so I will continue to cook at home.",1,A,Saigon Cafe,Saigon Cafe,S@igon C@fe,2.0,NEGATIVE

"Went here as it's closer than the Palma Ceia location, albeit neither are too far of a distance.  Tend to only come on the rare occasion my husband has a hankering for wings. In the past, we've had questionable service and were hoping that this had improved, as it's been at least  a year since the last visit. We quickly realized things have remain unchanged, if not worse.

We weren't sure if we needed to wait to be seated or seat ourselves as there wasn't a sign or staff around, so we sat ourselves near the entrance. Server eventually came to our table and meals came quickly enough. Husband eventually needed a refill and we both looked around occasionally (5 mins or so), no sight of our server. I finally got up and walked over to who appeared to be the manager and requested the refill. Came shortly after by our original server.  Not sure where she had been?  When we were ready to pay the bill, again, no server in sight - waited for quite some time (again) and finally gave up and walked up to the bar to have them sign us out. It was hardly a busy night, it was actually fairly empty, so that was not a possible factor into the poor service.  

If the food was great, I would have given another star, but my food, coupled with the terrible service is just unacceptable.  Husband said wings were ok, while my food and our app left much to be desired. I know I will not return and not sure if I will even go to another location.

Their baked goods to pair with the coffee were uninspired and boring. The normal danishes, muffins, and biscottis. They had individual packages of oatmeal that they were trying to showcase with ""fancy"" flavor combinations.

Tried the insalata pizza and the tagliatelle pasta entrees.

Loved the insalata pizza, crust was perfectly crisp, great garlic flavor, combination of fennel, arugula, capers was great and it was perfectly dressed with a citrus vinaigrette. 

The pasta dish was a bit disappointing, didn't really get any truffle flavor, and it could have used a bit more seasoning in general, just tasted like a buttery fettuccine dish. But the pasta was nicely cooked.

"It was a cute hole in the wall near Busch Gardens, and I love Cuban food so we gave it a try. I wanted Picadillo but everyone makes that differently and they had ingredients I don't prefer and I like mine with fried potatoes in the meat. So my husband and I ordered various other things I can tell you about. The shredded pork was a little dry, black beans were too liquidy, yellow rice had no taste, tostones also had no taste, and the Cuban sandwich was all ham and almost no pork! They also put salami in their Cuban sandwich which I ordered without because I'm not trying to Italianize my Cuban. But the bread was good. I have had Cuban sandwiches from Key West to all over florida, but for some reason the best Cuban sandwich I've ever had still comes from a food truck in Austin TX called the Texas Cuban. They are from Miami though, I think.

The price is right (a few buck cheaper than the corporate run), the staff is friendly & the food is really good (the homemade spaghetti sauce & their super-chunky homemade bleu cheese is my fave!) There menu is pretty big, so its easy to find something that suits your palate. My husband loves the Black&Blue Angus burger... Not to mention you get waitress service at your table through the whole movie. Definitely comes in handy during the long movies! They collect towards the end of the movie, so make it easy on yourself & be ready for a small interuption. It takes less than a minute to check your bill & slide'm your c.c.

"I really loved Shah's when it opened, but the quality has completely gone down the drain. It feels like the owner started the business then left his employees to take over with no oversight or help. Absolute chaos. Portion sizes are tiny (we got half a portion of rice and maybe 5 pieces of meat), they barely put any sauce on (none on the rice), salad was soggy, and the meat feels reheated. Food was barely warm. And they got our order wrong. 

The staff was very rude, hard to get ahold of, and two of the employees weren't wearing masks or gloves. No one was wearing hairnets. Everyone's hands were dirty from trying to fix the truck itself. I saw someone comment on them messing with the generator then getting back to making food - this is exactly what I saw too. If your generator isn't working, maybe it's a good idea to close for the day. Also, they had a weird system where they can't take credit cards but want you to send money on Zelle or Cashapp and show them your phone screen when done. I thought this was bizarre. 

They also got our order very wrong. We ordered 4 platters and a gyro. We got 2 platters and 2 gyros. When I asked them for what was missing, I got a very rude ""I gave that to you already"" in reply. When I showed her every single container, she finally accepted the mistake. Extra sauce is an extra charge, and they're out of hot sauce and falafel. You get a drink with every order - the choices are Mountain Dew and ginger ale. Huh?

I saw multiple people ahead of me tell them they ordered ahead and be met with looks of confusion. I'm not sure why Shah's is on Uber Eats or any other platform if they don't allow delivery/pick up.

Went back for lunch today and thoroughly enjoyed bartaco.

They have a great lunch special and being that i'm gestational diabetes I had to try to cut out my bread and fun stuff. I opted for lettuce leaves on my tacos and had the side chopped salad. I did the fish, chicken and mushroom taco they all turned out well. The deal is pretty good at $11 and I was surprisingly FULL.

Served almost as a sandwich, and with some highly addictive potato chip type thing that seemed like a yam that was sliced, fried, and salted. My buddy destroyed those before he even got to the kota.

I also can't wait to try the grilled cheese... I've yet to encounter a food truck that doesn't make an amazing one, so this is next on my list.

"On the pricier side, but everything was absolutely delicious.

This won't be a cheap or fast lunch, but it will be a delicious one. Here are the two dishes that I thought were absolutely superb.

SEAFOOD COBB: This is a light salad. It has huge chunks of shrimp and lobster and I walked away feeling healthy yet satisfied. 

TRUFFLE MAC AND CHEESE: I have a hard criteria for mac and cheese. For it to be worth the calories it needs to be very good. Usually I find something wrong, like the noodles are too mushy, or the cheese is too heavy, but this one is amazing. The noodles stay firm and the cheese just pours right over it. The truffle adds the finishing touch. I can't remember the last time I loved a mac and cheese this much.

I was trying to get in and out in less than an hour, but did not succeed. I actually had to leave my lunch companion so I could get home in time for a meeting. This is the place for a more leisurely lunch, even in the middle of a workday.

Parking is easy and plentiful. 

The dining room is quite beautiful. There is tons of natural light from the wall of window. It made taking a picture difficult, but I'm sure that wasn't their main priority when creating this room.

From the moment walking in and being greeted with a big smile from a nice woman (I had the impression she was the owner) to walking out with a fully belly I was happy.

The people behind the counter were all very pleasant (lead by the aforementioned woman) and their menu was easy to read with a lot of options.  Even when my wife asked to make a change on her sandwich it was no problem and they were thrilled to accommodate us.

While sitting and waiting for the sandwiches to be made fresh, we loved seeing the quaint decor with things that you could tell the owner was proud of... Even a quilt!

"La Teresita Café and Bakery is now located at 3248 W. Columbus Drive at the intersection of W. Columbus Drive and Lincoln Avenue, immediately adjacent to it's famous sister Cuban restaurant - La Teresita.

The café and bakery looks like a little out building next to the main restaurant and cafeteria / diner next door, but walk through the doors of this smaller building and you'll find a terrific little Latin bakery that also serves very good Mexican food. The Capdevila family, though Cuban by birth, works their culinary magic on a Mexican menu filled with traditional appetizers like nachos, guacamole, ceviche, and quesadillas; as well as chicken, beef, pork and seafood entrees. These folks really know how to cook, and everyone who works in any of their restaurants is super friendly.

The Mexican restaurant is small, and you'll be looking right into the bakery where the guys are busy baking Cuban bread and other goodies. Your eyes can't help but drift over to the display cases filled with pastries and baked goods. After your meal you must walk over and look at the incredible selection of cookies, flan, cheesecakes, pastelitos, buñuelos, croqueticas in the display cases, and all of the amazing cakes in the big cooler.

This is also the place to come to place your orders for catering and party platters with roast pork, turkey and ham as top favorites, along with all of your favorite sides and spectacular baked goods to go.

For lunch today I had the Mexican steak which was a marinated skirt steak grilled with tomatoes, onions, peppers, and some Jalapenos, then served with rice, refried beans, and fresh tortillas. That also came with chips & salsa. Delicious and inexpensive!

Inside, you'll also find a small counter which serves the incredibly popular Cuban cortado coffee which is an espresso cut with a small amount of warm milk. You'll be buzzing along happily after one of these!  : - )

"My friend told me this place was legit and with me being from LA, I had to try it. 

So here are the pros:
-Near my house
-Cheap prices
-Great ingredients
-Tortillas are made from scratch
-The avocado/tomatillo cream sauce is to die for!
-Covered eating area that is clean (napkins and sanitizer!)
-Inside of truck is very clean
-Menu is not hard to navigate
-Drink selection includes mexican sodas which is always a plus!


Cons:
-Tacos are very small! ($2 a piece); I had to order 3 to get full
-The Al pastor was pretty spicy - for ppl who love spice, this is for you; but I am used to my Al Pastor being mild
-Not all the food is fresh; I saw the ladies microwaving beans and rice, so I am unsure if they cook it in the morning and re-heat it or use it from the previous day?
-I feel they give you too much sauce in a cup and too many limes. They could probably save $ by cutting back here
-On the menu, there are no sides listed; I wasn't sure what in all I could put on my tacos, so I had to ask. (Sour cream, hot sauce and the avocado/tomatillo cream is what I was told)
-Parking is tight due to the truck being in the lot of the market

Tips to the owners:
-Maybe have a pic of each item so people can see what they are getting before they order?

"A hole in the wall place in Armenia. I saw several good reviews so I had to venture out. The chicha morada was an excellent alternative refreshing drink made of corn and I could see it would working well spiked with vodka. The fried wantan with this delectable green sauce was the comped appetizer. I
ordered the ceviche mixto, this is made daily they say.
The plate as you can see is large, it had a combo of seafood including squid, fish, mussels and shrimp.
Super fresh tasting. I ordered a side of white rice and it worked great satisfying the Chinese Cuban in me. Not too excited about the whole hominy and the hard corn that comes with it. The boiled yam  that accompanied was very nice. The place filled up on Sunday for lunch. The menu is in Spanish and Ingles, so all is good.

Amuni is now Uncle Giuseppe.   They have a deli and premade foods in addition to the pizza. They also have some seating, both inside and outside. You order at the at the deli counter or the cashier (for pizza), then they bring you the food when it is ready.

They do not sell alcohol, but there is a wine bar next door where you can buy a bottle to drink at Amuni. Or you can bring your own bottle. Note: Amuni has a corkscrew but no wine glasses. If you dont want to drink out of plastic cups, you need to buy wine from the wine bar.

"To preface this review, I feel compelled to include that *I absolutely loathe writing bad reviews & I feel awful doing this.*

Yesterday evening, my family and I excitedly visited the new Midtown Tampa Shake Shack, but sadly, we left deeply disappointed. I had been hyping up the franchise to my family for some time, seeing as I've been a lover of Shake Shack since ~2016 when I had my first magical experience at a Las Vegas Shake Shack franchise. Since then, I've been to various SS franchises around the country--Chicago, San Francisco, etc. Every time, it's been a delicious, memorable event. Top-notch burgers, shakes, fries, chicken, sauces, etc. The Midtown Tampa Shake Shack is severely lacking in more ways than one. 

Cons:
1) Parking is atrocious 
2) We waited ~30 minutes for our food to be ready to take to go--there was only 1 single order ahead of our own
3) The shake machine was down/broken 
4) Staff were seemingly careless, preoccupied, moody
5) The fries & hot dog were both overdone 

Pros: 
1) Clean environment

Gave this two stars just because of my love for chipotle as a chain but this location is poorly run and is one of the few focused purely on profits and not on customer service/satisfaction.  I eat at chipotle at least twice a week and get the same ingredients; I know what a normal burrito looks like.  The one they made for me at this location was at least 30% smaller than any burrito I have ever had.  It was smaller than a typical taco.  When I politely asked if I could have a new burrito or just supplement with a taco the manager gave me the fifth degree about what was in the burrito and that sizes always vary.  I didn't really feel like arguing so just walked away with a poor experience and walked out the door still hungry.

So far I've only tried the CHURRASCO SKIRT STEAK PLATE ($14) with yellow rice, but I honestly don't know if I will ever try anything else because it was SOOOO GOOD! Seasoned by angels and cooked with such perfection that I will absolutely crave this for the rest of my life! THIS, my dear Yelp people, is EXACTLY what I mean by ""flavorful"" seasoning. They have completely ruined skirt steak cooked by anyone else because I can't go back to anything less than this level of satisfaction! Even the Strawberry Banana Smoothie ($6) is excellent!

the bread/rolls that come out are warm, but are obviously some prepackaged rolls that they likely picked up as they were buying bags of salad at the grocery store. 

$17.99 for an amazing entree that includes salad, decent. but that same price for obviously prepackaged foods, umm, not so decent. but in the end it tasted good, but the feeling that it was prepackaged and not as fresh as it should be and the lack of culinary skill or imaginative food, I was a bit dissappointed.",22,B,Sunset Grille,Sunset Grille,Suns3t Grill3,3.0,POSITIVE

"I've been to London Heights quite a few times. Typically, my go-to is their Jameson Whiskey Bleu Burger, which is delightful. Here lately, I've been counting my calories and generally trying to eat a bit healthier. So I decided to switch it up this time.

I ordered the Jerk Cauliflower ""wings"" as a starter. I enjoyed the spicy flavor, but the cauliflower was very soft and mushy (is that a good thing)? It was also much smaller than I imagined. The blue cheese and ranch were each $1 extra, but neither of them were hardly touched because the wings were gone in a minute!

For my entree, I had the Chicken Curry, which is chicken with curried vegetables and served over white rice. It seemed like there was an over-abundance of carrots in the bowl, again cooked to the point of mush. I found myself wishing that I had ordered my usual burger.

My girlfriend ordered the Burrita salad and added a side of chicken. The salad came served on an enormous bed of tomato slices, with basil and mozzarella then drenched with a balsamic vinaigrette. Again, the portioned chicken was very small and unfulfilling.

Overall, it was a very uninspired meal. The Diet Coke was served flat and it seemed like the kitchen was very slow getting our food to the table after the appetizer.

This place serves superb Mexican street food such as elotes, fruit cups, mangonadas, tacos and tortas. 

I came in search of a mangonada and birria tacos. I was delighted to find both, and how! The mangonada was refreshing with lots of mango flavor. I wish it was spicy too, but mostly it was sweet with a little tart and salt. Maybe next time, I'll go with a fruit cup instead, since I love fruit served with salt, chili pepper and lime. The birria tacos were excellent. The meat was tender and flavorful, so much that I didn't need the consomme, although that was awesome too! (Actually, the consomme was so full of meat and herbs, that I ate some of it with the radishes and onion garnish. It was too good to waste.) The tacos were hard to eat as it's a 20 minute drive from this location to my home, and there's nowhere to eat in the store, so by the time I ate them, they were soggy. But I powered through! My only criticism was the double tortilla thing. I'm assuming they were doubled because they were not homemade, so they were flimsier. But I'm so in love with the birria, that I'll forgive the tortillas.

Prices were very reasonable, and serving sizes were excellent. My tacos were about 50% bigger than the birria tacos I had at Crazy Burrito earlier this week.

I'll happily return to try more of their menu.",22,B,Tacos El Flako,Tacos El Flako,Tacos El Flako Inc.,5.0,POSITIVE

"The Silo Eatery-Coffee-and Bakery is a great place to stop and have breakfast or lunch. As a retired employee of the school district I was well aware of the quality of the food as I used to work at the downtown main office which housed the first Core Cafe. The eatery as it was referred to by my friend that I met there for lunch, actually works at the site and assists clients with having events at the building as well as several divisions of the School District to conduct training and other culinary demonstrations. I was able to take a tour of the facility with my friend and took several pics of the well appointed decor that surrounds the training area and where the events are held. For Lunch we got the Margherita flatbread and the Haystack sandwich which is offered half or whole with several choices of sides. Everything is made to order on premises and is fresh. Also they have a wonderful choice of salads daily and several fresh baked pastries with an in-house pastry chef. Today they had several cookies with seasonal fun decorations on them. They also have fresh cupcakes and fresh Jeffrey's brand coffees available. This cafe is tucked away in the Silo bend office complex and can be accessed by anyone. Hidden Gem would best describe this place. The Menu changes weekly and there is a digital board for you to view or check the website.  They also can cater for your office as well. Check them out if you are in the area for your next quick bite.  They offer indoor and outdoor seating. The cafe was very clean and all the employees were very helpful.

Stellar service, great chips. Authentic Mexican cantina vibe. Good prices! 

The not so good:

Beans should've been more caliente , less limón in the guacamole, and the delish house salsa is 1000% too liquidy - like it's made w tomato Juice. The fajita ensalada was skimpy - please make a nice plate with shredded cabbage, tomato and onion, limon, crema and guac as is the custom . Juke Box was muy ruido. Turn it down please for nice background música. Use nice, nice thick napkins, not the tissue- thin kind. And please clean the glass front doors, add some plants and freshen up the mood! 

And pleeeeaaaassseee add chile rellenos, more grilled veggies for vegetarian fajitas (cauliflower, broccoli, hongos, eggplant), free sour cream, and a Baja fish taco (crispy) plato!

"We happened to be on that end of town and I wanted something to eat that would be somewhat satisfying. It had on the check in 'Hot New Place' so we said why not. It seems like it was either an old diner or Chinese restaurant before because the booth we ended up sitting at was already full of red masking tape where there were rips in the seat. 

There is a check in special, so make sure to take advantage of it coz don't know if you'll be back...It was for a free appetizer or drink. We ended up picking the appetizer and got crab rangoon. It didn't seem to have much life to it and was definately no flavor even my kid spit the pieces back to me. The prices for the sushi rolls were a bit much so we just ordered a pad thai with shrimp.  It seemed like it was slopped together and the padthai packet paste that they used seem to be more sticky and made the noodles super gummy.

Disclaimer: We did get there 45 minutes before the restaurant closed- if that says anything.

Service-... it was my table and another table and we kind of never saw our 1 server... so we ran out of water and napkins and kind of were just waiting for our check so we could leave. I understand we only ordered one thing but I mean come on ... the waiter was chit chatting with the owner and sushi chef most of the time.

"Went to dinner here for my birthday tonight. Made reservations for 7:30. We were promptly seated at a small table for 2 (which is fine). The table was up against the window and the sun was literally right in my eyes. I asked the hostess if there was anything she could do as far as covering the window and she said she would see. The server (Adam) told us that there was nothing to cover the window, he's asked a million times but management hasn't come up with a resolution. Here's my resolution - don't sit people at that table when the sun is setting.... Also, they cram far too many tables in a small area. So, the manager came and asked if we would like to move to a different table, which we did and appreciated. This table was now close to the live band ...so dinner conversation was slim to none :(. Although the live band was nice ...a tad loud.

We ordered an appetizer (calamari) which was good and came out quick. 

I then ordered the chicken piccata and asked for a side of pasta with it (as it doesn't come with any pasta or any other sides). 

Our food came out and I took a few bites and realized that they served me veal piccata. I asked the server if this was veal and he said yes, that's what he heard me say. I don't eat red meat so I know I didn't say veal. He asked if I wanted him to take it back for chicken and I said no (I did not want to wait for a whole extra meal to be made again) and just swapped with my boyfriend (chicken parm). The dinner entrees were mediocre ... Nothing to brag about. The piccata tasted nothing like your normal piccata dish- looked and seemed more like Marsala.

The server was so weeded ..we barely saw him. I understand they moved us from his section so we were away from the rest of his tables, but if you can't handle that then just let the other server take us. My boyfriend never once got a refill on his water or asked if he wanted another beer. 

We ordered dessert ...the cookie. It was taking a while, but we didn't mind or say anything. The server came up and told us the kitchen burnt the first one so they were making a second and he was sorry for the wait. The cookie came out shortly after and was decent....still burnt though.

We then waited about 20 minutes before we saw our server -- who I actually had to flag down to get our check . The manager actually came to our table (because he probably noticed we have been sitting there forever) and Asked if we were ok and needed our check... The server shortly after came speeding to our table, dropped the check and went back to the party in his section. At this time, we were ready to go, as we had been there an hour and a half. 

When the bill came, I noticed the server didn't even have the order changed from veal piccata to chicken piccata ($6 difference). Which truly isn't a huge deal, but you think with all of the issues, they would either change the bill to reflect what I originally ordered or remove the cookie .($9)...something.

I probably won't be returning here. The service was not good and the food was mediocre , especially for how pricey it was. Happy birthday to me...",5,A,Timpano Hyde Park,Timpano Hyde Park,Timp@no Hyde P@rk,3.0,NEGATIVE

I was really surprised. They have always been so helpful and cool before. The owner has always been awesome. Today I go in to get a product and inquire about some juice. The girl that waited on me acted like she couldn't be bothered from the first second. Every question I asked she rolled her eyes and acted put out. I bought the device but opted not to buy any juice. I'll get it elsewhere. She was so rude that I almost didn't buy the product either. If I wasn't going out of town tomorrow I would have driven 2 miles down the road to another vape shop. In addition, the last 2 times I have been there none of the staff are wearing masks at any time. Maybe a different owner but it has definitely changed for the worse and that is a real shame.

"Why 4 stars? I'm sad it took Tampa this long to get a Shake Shack, but I'm glad I was able to patronize it before leaving.

   ---   ---   ---

I can't even remember how long we've known that Shake Shack was coming to Midtown, but I feel like it was possibly all the way back in early 2019. I'm sure the pandemic did not help matters, but as soon as we learned of the opening date, I knew I'd be stopping in shortly thereafter.

I might say something controversial here, but I prefer Five Guys. Especially when it comes to the fries. But Shake Shack does a very solid job. And at least at this location, the customer service can't be beat. I think the main thing they do well is that they are just branded and marketed as a cool place. Maybe it's because Tampa was pretty much the last major city to get a location (or at least, it seemed like it). It could just be the scarcity effect. Either way, the sorcery worked on me and I was incredibly stoked to visit.

I actually went in twice and, as I mentioned, every employee we dealt with was super friendly. The first time I dined in and the second time I ordered online with a pickup time of 7:30p. I walked in at 7:25p and the place was p-a-c-k-e-d. I was pretty nervous that I was going to be waiting for my food for a long time. But at 7:28, I got a text to approach the counter and let the person know that I arrived. I did that, and literally within 10 seconds, she handed me my food, hot off the grill. For only being open a couple of weeks, I was blown away with how prompt that experience was.

"So here's the thing, my husband and I visited this place while on a weekend away and we sadly used a Groupon which was a bigger deal than I thought. BEFORE we visited this restaurant we called and made sure there were no restrictions with using a Groupon and made sure they were accepted. We got to the restaurant and felt lost. Lol. Someone saw us looking confused and finally directed us that seats are available in the back. We finally sat down and our server greeted us and before we ordered we AGAIN mentioned our Groupon, she then told us that they accept it. We ordered but our food took a while to get to us.

We had to ask for our bill otherwise we probably would have been sitting there for another 30 minutes.

Our server already had passed that information on to us, letting us know that her manager ""did us a favor."" Let's be clear though, our dinner was not free, we paid Groupon before hand. It just rubbed us the wrong way by how he went about telling us. We were planning to head out after we ate but something about the food just did not sit well with our stomachs.

She blankly stared at me and waited for me to just tell her, which I did. After all ingredients were added, I asked her what kind of finishing ingredients there were. Such as salt & pepper, etc. She pointed to the containers without a word. Obviously,  the containers were not labeled. When I inquired what the containers contained.

"While not the most experienced with Boba tea, I am very pleased with my experiences here. Quality has been consistently good. I mainly order and go, but it looks very clean and is well lit. I suppose you'd say it has a 'young' atmosphere with a few arcade cabinets in the back and stylish furniture. A book case style shelf partitions the room and has books, board games and super hero statues on it. 
The menu is huge! I've tried 6-7 of the drinks and a few kinds of jelly and Boba. We've been happy to return and try more. They also have Macaron cookies. They have been some of the best we've tried or ordered. 
Staff have been friendly and courteous. Service has been rather quick as well.

"When you're here for a hockey game or a convention, the Chase Club is definitely a great spot in Amalie Arena.

Specifically for hockey games, the array of food offerings is unreal...I cannot name all the items they had the last time I was here but, there were salads, (I had them make me one specifically with the things I could have...),there were snack type foods, there was a Thanksgiving sandwich (carved turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce and rolls), the desserts were lovely, the ice cream near the coffee is always a fun touch....there must have been 30 other things....you won't go hungry here....  And the drinks are all included too.  Not just beer and wine.....all your liquor as well.

Bathrooms are nice.
And the seats aren't so bad either...

It's a great place to mingle with other fans and enjoy the game.  It's nice to come to the Club!",35,C,Chase Club,Chase Club,Ch@se Club,5.0,POSITIVE

Regardless its a great dinner, Sunday brunch place to get together with friends and family. Outdoor seating is great. They have music playing some times.

"Got towed at 9am in the lot while it was closed. Got a pickup order from Starbucks and my vehicle was towed within minutes.

I acknowledge I shouldn't have parked there, first and last time as well as a customer ordering from this business as I live in the neighborhood and do love pizza haha; But will unfortunately not use papa Johns in the future. 

There was a man parked in a Johnson fire control van parked next to me when I pulled in and was on the other side of the lot when my car was towed. I drove by 30 minutes later and he was still there, I believe being used as a spotter for Bilal towing which is illegal.  The manager of the towing company essentially told me to screw off and see him in small claims court if I wanted to see any photo or video footage of my vehicle prior to the tow to see if there was damage prior.

"This is memorable night from The International Culinary School at The Art Institute of Tampa. This dinner no doubt is one of the best in the Bay now. The cost is low, the food is great, and we even get Chef Treatment. Tonight dinner is one that closer to my heart. The restaurant or the institute is naming as Tutored Chef and they only serves dinner on Thursday and Friday night from 6 pm to 8 pm. Please call 813-393-5395 for reservation.

The menu has ten items to select. Each item not more than $6.95. You also can try their special combination of the ten items from the menu with three to five course meals. The three courses is $13.95, four courses is $15.95, and five courses is $17.95. This is a steal and price buzzer. They are currently serving the spring menu. The summer menu will be start at July. I would encourage the patron go to support them. However, if you want to get the best cooking skill, come after four to six week later when they are familiar with their menu. That is when the food is goooooood. The food and the tip are going to the school. You can tip extra with cash and mention it is for the people who serve you. It is good for the student who serves you. 

Tonight we have everything in the menu. The restaurant starts with crouton with herb dip and enhance flavor butter. Then follow by baked empanada with passion fruit and Cajun Spice for opening. We started with grilled asparagus in asparagus puree and bacon bit. This is a well presented dish and it is elegantly presented. The asparagus is well cook and go well with the Canadian type bacon. The second initial entrée is the Egg - it is soft broil fried egg serve over the Mushroom Ragout. When the egg is cut, the egg yolk is spilled over the mushroom. The mushroom is cook with wine sauce. When it mixed with the egg yolk, it has added the flavor. The egg is fried with crust and tasty to eat. The third initial dish is the soup du Jour. The soup is one of the student creations. Creamy soup is served with smoke bacon. 

The main dish starts with the lamb - Chilled Grilled Leg of Lamb serve over the Israeli Couscous. It also has the touch of the Chimichurri sauce that makes the grilled lamb more desirable. The second main dish is shrimp - The shrimp is cook with Tarragon Tomato Relish and Chive Oil. It serves over the risotto. The taste is like old bay seasoning for the Maryland Crab. It goes well with the risotto. The third main dish is pork - They are two type pork is served here. Braise Smoked Pork Shanks and Sautéed Pork Tenderloin.  These are two different type of preparation. And both are good. It also serves with Potato Gratin, Baby Carrot, and snow peas. It is a balance meal. The fourth main dish is the beef - Slice Grilled Beef is place on top of the crouton and place on top of sweet Onion Marmalade. The onion is sautéed to soft and good for the mixed with the beef.

We close the night with Blueberry financier on blueberry sorbet and blueberry compote. It is pretty muffin cake over blue berry ice cream and syrup. We also have the Chocolate Marquis top with Ice Cream and roasted pistachios. Chocolate is same as mousse.

Jian-Yu was a very inattentive, sloppy and rude server and I'm surprised he has the job that he has. My boyfriend ordered a beer which came out promptly, but 20 minutes passed and my drink order was no where to be seen. I ordered the restaurant's version of a Bloody Mary, and at the time I ordered it Jian-Yu interrogated me about how I like my Bloody Mary (he specifically called out to me that the drink would come with a salted rim). After 20 minutes I followed up with him on the drink and he seemed to have no recollection that I had even ordered something. He finally brought me a drink after I followed up, and it was a fruity drink that definitely was NOT a Bloody Mary and did NOT have a salted rim. I alerted him of the wrong drink order and he tried to argue with me that I had ordered the tropical drink despite the fact that he had spoken to me at length about the salted rim and what was in the Bloody Mary. My semi-correct drink finally came 30+ minutes after I ordered, but again without a salted rim that I specifically requested and was told was how the house Bloody Mary was made.

Armature Works is one of my favorite spots in Tampa and Empamamas fits right in.  The day that I tried it I went for the cheeseburger in paradise and the Tampa girl.

"I have never been soo disappointed. :(  I drive by this place every day and when I saw the signs and lights change I thought nothing but happy thoughts.  I listen to Bubba on occasion and I grew up watching Hulk, so to find my experience so disappointing really stings.  Lets start with the walk-up...
  At the very least I expect a warm smile and a pleasant greeting at the entrance... Nope.  You first walk down a long hall, first past the bathrooms (ugh) then the kitchen entrance (ugh ugh, I'll explain later), then past some Hulk Memorabilia (actually quite cool but poor location), then to the server station.  No smile on this hostess.  It looked like I inconvenienced her to stand up and seat us at an outdoor table, a situation I assumed was within her scope of work.  She waved for us to follow her, picking up menu's from what appeared to be an angry group leaving, handing her the menu's as they walked out.  She seemed surprised, but relieved she didn't have to go searching for menus.  
 And then we were seated, at the worst outdoor table in history.  There are 50 tables outside, 49 of which have an umbrella.  The hostess (attempts) to seat us at the outcast table, to which my (easygoing and laid-back) fiance suggest we sit at a waterfront umbrella'd table.  Ok, we're now seated.  All is well right?  Not so much...
  About 10 minutes later our kind hearted server takes our drink order, 2 on-tap beers.  10 minutes later I walk up to the bar to re-order our yet-to-be-delivered drink order, when I get a tap on the back.  It's our server, with our drinks.  I reluctantly walk away from the bar, having stood there for 3-plus minutes without getting any attention from what surprisingly appeared to be a well-staffed, low-occupancy bar tonight.  So I sit down and order another round immediately, not knowing whether our next round will come before midnight.  It's 7pm.  Server apologizes for the 1st time.  Then we place our food order, this is when the fun begins. Ha.
 We start with the calamari app.  Pretty easy from a chef's standpoint right?  Don't over-fry it and serve it over a tasty tomato sauce.  Yep, WELL overcooked  (calamari was like chewing on thick rubber bands, but the sauce, the sauce was actually quite good)  And the quantity was lackluster at best.  Of the 20% that was edible, it didn't let us enjoy a sauce that could have really made the appetizer. On to entrees.  Yay.
 I order the Mahi Mahi tacos.  They come in 3's with sea-salt thick-cut fries and homemade cole slaw. My fiance ordered the yellowfin tuna burger, and the server asked her how she wanted it prepared.  Hmm, I don't think yellowfin tuna works well with anything less than ""cooked"".  So she asks, ""How do you prefer it be prepared?"" Which he responds, ""to be honest we haven't had one second of training on this menu so I have no idea""  Well that kind of sent our already disappointing dining experience right down the drain.  She ordered what I ordered and once again we were dining ""sans-server"" for 20 minutes, until the overcooked calamari graced us with it's rubbery presence.  It was at this time the server ""up-sold"" us to a pitcher of beer, which we would have accepted regardless, but moreso since we didn't really feel like waiting another 30 minutes for him to come around again.  
 Then the food came.  It's really hard to mess up mahi tacos.  But somehow they did it.  The fish was as rubbery as the calamari, which is actually quite impressive.  I mean, to make a flaky white fish the consistency of a gelatinous tentecaled sea creature takes some creativity, but they nailed it.  It was almost returnable, but seeing as that process would have taken another hour-plus of server interaction, we choked it down and looked around.  It appeared that every other table around us was in a similar situation.  Someone asking for a server, someone asking where their drinks are, someone asking for their check, someone asking for a noose...  Ok, maybe not that bad but... ok, it was that bad.  It's too bad our taco's were the worst part of the entree, the fries were perfectly cooked and seasoned nicely, and the coleslaw was absolutely delicious.  We loaded the tacos with the 'slaw to ease the agony of eating ridiculously overcooked Mahi. 
  I saw a sweet elderly couple walk from the parking lot, on to the outdoor dining area, approach the server to ask to sit at an empty table, ONLY to be re-directed by the server to the hostess station for seating.  For God sakes man these people don't have much time, seat them, THEN TELL the hostess that the table was seated.  You have to be flexible and accommodating.
 It was when we asked for our check that we finally got the pitcher of beer we ordered during the appetizer. I'm running out of room, but all in all, this place needs SERIOUS WORK.

Pizza was cold, once we FINALLY got it, and halfway through the second slice my friend notices a bug in her cold piece of pizza.

"Stopped by on Saturday at 4:00-ish to grab some chicken tenders to snack on while my wife and son and I watched the FSU/BC game.  Must have been the grand opening as there was a DJ outside and 4 or 5 people dancing to music.  I placed a to go order for some chicken tenders.  I was quoted a wait time of 10-12 minutes.  What became immediately obvious is the kitchen was not up to speed yet.  I'd say most people waited at least 30-45 minutes for to go orders. It seemed that the kitchen could only handle one order at a time.  I heard one gentlemen comment that he thought he'd have to come back tomorrow to get his order.   What sent me over the edge is that a young man who ordered after me and might have been an employee or might have known the staff ordered 10 minutes or so after me and got his food 10 minutes before I did.

For a place that only has ""six tables"" we were expecting amazing food, fun presentation, something different and that attention to detail that lacks in almost all your larger restaurants.  What we got was just a mediocre meal with nothing really standing out as memorable or amazing.  I believe they would do better with less options and more detail to each plate.  With so few tables it should be like dining at an amazing chefs house.  They show you the menu and you eat it, maybe post the menu online and through email to past guests then perfect that menu and blow peoples minds.

I will say this, the staff was so very nice and hospitable so there is a chance we will be back.

Hostess wasn't particularly friendly. It was a busy night so I waited about 30 minutes for a table for one.

Once I was seated, the service was great. Very attentive server. Ordered a Crab Trap drink, which was delicious and well-priced at $6/6.50. Ordered my favorite food in the world, Alaskan King Crab, with a skewer of sugarcane shrimp. The shrimp was melt-in-your-mouth delicious. The crab wasn't cooked correctly (you ask: how hard is it to steam/braise crab? I know!) The problem was with the texture of the shell. It was bend-y, so it wouldn't crack open easily. It took me FOREVER (like 2 hours?) to get the meat out. Otherwise, the flavor of everything was great.

It was A-OK. I prefer Legal Seafoods at home, but this was a decent substitution while on the road.

"********  IGNORE THE 3, 4 AND 5 STAR REVIEWS  *******

Here we have the textbook definition of an overrated Tampa restaurant that is in fact a total and complete shithole.

Case in point. Went here for breakfast (at new Tahitian Inn location) and my dining companion had the good sense to ask the waitress whether the sausage gravy was from a can. I sort of thought it was a rude question, because there's no way it could be, right? Especially not a 4-star rated breakfast place on Yelp, where people talk about the ""home-cooked"" food?

And then the waitress said ""It's from a can.""

Who serves people sausage gravy from a can? Pach's Place does!

The rest of the food, from the bacon to the french toast to the eggs, tasted artificial and was just plan horrible. The bacon was thin and horrible quality. The eggs tasted artificial. Everything pretty much tasted like it was microwaved. For the love of God, do not even think about ordering a biscuit. I think the ones from a fast-food drive through are better.

The only people who could possibly think this is good food is people who A, don't have taste buds, or B, eat Stouffer's frozen meals daily from a microwave, and think this is a step up from that.

It is a step up from Stouffer's, but not a big step.

"HIDDEN GEM ALERT!!! 

Man, I wish I had read Dayna P's review back in '09. If you're a fan of Acapulco Mexican Grocery, you would be a greater fan of La Fiesta, as it is really a hidden gem with even cheaper prices than Acapulco Mexican.  The food is actually better than Acapulco, in my opinion, and there's more seating.  

It is located in the Palmetto Beach neighborhood of Tampa, which is the area south of Ikea as you go down 21st St.  You have to take a left on one of the side roads to get there (or go behind Ikea and drive around the neighborhood at your peril), so that's why it truly is a hidden gem. Be cautious though as it is not the best area. 

The place is deceiving because from the outside, it looks larger. You walk in and the grocery area is pretty tight. Walk through one of the aisles and head back and it opens up a little. You'll be greeted by one of the friendly women working there who provide great service in the restaurant and store. The menu doesn't list all the drinks on it but they do have horchata, aguas frescas (Just ask for the daily flavors), etc.  If you prefer, you can grab a Jarrito, Fanta, Mexican Coke or whatever. And being that it's in a grocery store, there are various beers (even some of the Mexican ones I never heard of before) that you can drink with your meal. 

I have had the horchata and watermelon agua fresca.  The horchata is awesome, a little different than other places. It was more like an iced chai. I asked the waitress (fluent in both Spanish and English) about it who explained that the rice is soaked in water for a day and that they use more milk than other places, which makes it more unique. Nice and smooth, no sandy taste, which is how I like my horchata.  Tonight I tried the watermelon agua fresca. At first glance, I thought she gave me a glass of water, but then I tasted it...YUM!  Nice choice, refreshing.

I've tried the steak and carnitas tacos.  I like them simple, with just cilantro and onion but they have salsa if you prefer. OK, here's the kicker....$1.25 each! Not a typo. $1.25!! Insane!  The premium flavors, such as lengua, tripa, pastor and chorizo, cost $1.50. Craziness. They're very good, authentic tacos. Are they the best in Tampa? No, but I can tell you where to find those (message me). But again, $1.25.  (you'll need to order at least 3 for a full meal) UPDATE: prices have gone up slightly. Still under $2

I've also had the Torta Fiesta Mexicana (sandwich with pork leg, Oaxaca cheese, lettuce, onion, tomato, mayonnaise, avocado) which comes with French fries.  Wow, this thing is huge! I could only eat half as I ate all the complimentary tortilla chips and salsa verde (tasty) while waiting because I was hungry.  But let me tell you, it was delicious. That pork with the cheese and mayo. Awesome combo. 

Aside from that, the store offers paletas from La Reyna de Michoacan. I've had the egg nog (I know, weird choice) and the Pine Nut (pinon). FYI: the date on the package is not an expiration date,  it's the manufacture date.  They also carry other yummy desserts in the fridge and a small pastry selection (again extremely cheap). 

Well there you have it. I didn't really want to write this review for fear that if the masses find out about this place, they may raise the prices. But no one really reads my reviews, I don't think. haha

The seasoning was absolutely perfect on both the bread and the pizza and the toppings were very fresh.  I'd definitely recommend the Roma crust.

Our party of 4 --without reservations--showed up on a Friday night at prime dinner time and were able to sit immediately at the bar.

We sampled the Fruity & lemonade, High West Old Fashioned, Cali-Fashion, and the Paper Plane. Each of them were excellent...but for $7 the Cali-Fashion is phenomenal. I hope this signature drink never changes including the happy hour price!

"I've driven by here countless times and today I finally caught them open. I was beginning to lose hope that I would ever get to taste the food here because Big Mike is only open three days a week. 

Wouldn't you know that the guy in front of me bought every last piece of brisket he had made for the day. Geez man, you could have left one piece... I settled for the ribs and sausage with mac n' cheese + greens. All I can say is ""damn!""  Juicy and flavorful at the same time. Mission BBQ was high on the list but I'm giving Big Mike's the nod in West Tampa because of how good his macaroni & cheese is. The sides didn't seem like they were an afterthought like most places. 

Come here when they're open and you'll probably see Mike on the pit and his son Avery helping him in the food truck. Can't say enough about these guys. Service was excellent, as well as the food. It's a good thing they're only open three days a week because if not, I'd come here from lunch and diner everyday and blow up like a balloon.",3,A,Big Mike's BBQ,Big Mike's BBQ,Big Mike's BBQ,5.0,POSITIVE

Service was slow to bad the first time we went for dinner. It was terrible this time when we went back for lunch. We were the only table in the restaurant when we ordered on a Monday at lunch and it took over 40 minutes to get our food.  We had to have it boxed up because it took too long. A table of three Hispanic guys came in about 10 minutes after us and got waited on by the owner. They were done eating before we got our food. The food we finally got was just like the last time. Mediocre to less than good.  The first time we went it was 80 min for dinner with no one else in the restaurant. They have no idea what they are doing.  I hope the three guys they chose to serve before us come back a lot because we never will. We orderd steak tacos and chicken tacos.

"I have ordered from this location numerous times and have never had this happen. So tonight we ordered a couple of pizzas and waited the average amount of time to get our delivery. I met our driver at the door and noticed when he handed me the bag with our two liter of Diet Pepsi that the pizza container tipped to one side. I did not think anything of it as he caught it midway. However, upon further investigation we found the pictures below. I called the location we ordered from asked to to speak to the manager. The young girl who answered and told me she was new said we are really busy and I said that she could please have one of them call me and left my cell number. Its9:48 pm now and still have not received a phone call. Being in management, I would want my people to let me know when a customer has requested to speak with me to find a solution. But, the manager at this place must not be a good manager and assume that because I have not called again that everything is fine. Well, It was not. Paid $50.00 for two pizzas delivered with a two liter of Diet Pepsi. To receive pizzas in this condition is unacceptable. I don't care who you are. It does not fly with me.

"In 48 hours I flew into Tampa, flew out to Key West, then flew back to Tampa.   It was late, I was hungry, and I was disappointed I couldn't find a decent BBQ place in Tampa.   So I just drove down the street from my hotel and found.....Sonny's BBQ

It's a chain but has been around for 40 years.   So as I scanned the menu....I spot the Super Combo...a little bit of everything....for $12.99....SOLD.   And here is how it went....

1.  Ribs:  Much like Rudy's in Albuquerque, the rib meat pulled off the bone but was not overcooked.   Silverskin still attached, the ribs had the chew, smoky flavor and pulled from the bone clean.   I was happy.   4 stars
2.  Pulled pork:   This pork was clearly roasted not steamed and mushy.   However it was a little dry.   It was ok but not great.  3 stars
3.  BBQ chicken:   Moist and tender... hint of being BBQ'ed...but not too bad overall.   Sauce not overpowering and complimenting the chicken.  4 stars
4.  BBQ Beef:   Like the pork, really nothing special here....edible but just plain beef.   It's ok.   3 stars
5.  Corn bread.   Pretty good cornbread...tastes homemade rather than a standard restaurant mix taste.   Good crunchy crust.   4 stars
6.  Sweet potato:   Baked in some butter in foil......locked in flavor ....good taste.   I really liked it.    4 stars
7.  BBQ Beans:   Good beans but nothing special.  3 stars

Overall 4 stars because it was the best BBQ place I have found so far in Tampa and it's a great value for the amount of food served.   Two people could have made a meal from this one take out.",25,B,Sonny's BBQ,Sonny's BBQ,Sonny's BBQ Inc.,4.0,NEGATIVE

"There's a lack of good barbecue in this area and we were hoping for great things.  However, things were just okay. Start with the Amber Bock on draft.  It was sour!  Bad, like dirty lines or the keg was sitting too long.  The waitress nicely apologized, saying they didn't move a lot of it.  My suggestion?  Take it off draft and offer it in bottles. Iced tea was a disappointment.  Now, I know how your mama brewed ice tea, cause my mama did the same thing.  Boil the tar out of the water, drop in the tea bags and let sit till cool.  Well, guess what, Mama.  There's a better way, and it would be nice had Big Papa's not hewn so closely to tradition.  Let Steep Up To 5 Minutes Then Remove Tea Bags!  Chill and serve.  That way it's not bitter and cloudy. 
    Next up, dinner.  The ribs were tender and delicous.  The smoked chicken quarter was yummy tender. Sauces were good, with big sweet being the best.  Baked beans, not so hot.  I don't care for crunchy (onion) in the baked beans.  In all fairness, baked beans are very individual to each person's taste.  These weren't mine.  They were a good flavor, though. They did have fried okra (yay!) that was not on the menu.  And it was good!

Literally enough meat for 1/3 of a sandwich pushed to the center and then cut.  last inch and a half of the sandwich was completely bread on each side.

I mean, come on! They don't make their own gyro meat either (it's from Krynos). Which could be fine, but I didn't see more than one small spit cooking either, instead of 2-3 big spits. Likely pre-sliced and heated up on the grill.

Fries frozen, and served cold. Anyone who thinks this food is good has obviously hasn't had decent Greek food (and I lived in Chicago for 6 years, so I know my Greek food). No tahini  sauce either, all tzatsiki.

"This pizza is great from the sauce up, but I just think the crust is kinda like cardboard. It does the trick for holding the good stuff, it just is like the heel of the loaf of bread that noone wants for a sandwich. 

I really do like their sauce. It's a little on the sweet side and I like that. And they use lots of gooey cheese and I like that too. 

The picture of the sandwich shows half of a meatball sub. It's probably a foot long sub! My daughter said the meatballs were great, and was super happy with her choice.

We got half extra cheese on our pizza and half meat lovers. Plenty of meat, and yummy! Again, if only that crust was better...it'd be a slam dunk.

We went on a Friday night about 6:15 and it was hopping in there! 2 people at the counter taking orders over the phone. Lots of tables inside, mostly full but a few empty so we could sit right away.

"Breakfast

This review is only about the breakfast.  Precious wanted a bite to eat before taking off.  She saw this place.  She got a bowl with scrambled eggs and what they portrayed as chorizo, but let me tell you, it really wasn't chorizo.  It was more like the taco meat from Taco Bell, spicy ground beef.

The eggs were below average, no salt, no taste.  The chorizo [sic] was as described above.  It's one of those meals that you regret having.  There are only so many calories one can eat without getting fat, and we wasted 500 plus or minus on that.

Also, a heads up, I strongly recommend NOT eating here outside of the peak lunch and dinner time.  The food is precooked, and it sits for who knows how long before it is served.  With an inexperienced staff or on a slow day, that can sit there long enough to get nasty.

"Stupidly I didn't read the reviews for westshore pizza before ordering my food. So I'm sitting here in the restaurant (empty on a Wednesday night at 7 PM is not a good sign) there's a soda machine near the entry doorway that is leaking all over the dining room floor. The two pizzas under the glass at the counter were so sad looking that I should have known better than to order. 
Obviously I was so hungry that I wasn't thinking straight and I ordered slices anyway. a slice of plain and a slice of pepperoni and a bottle of water not a bad deal for six dollars if it was actually good. 

Unfortunately the pizza was so undercooked and soggy it was inedible. I didn't think the girl behind the counter looked like she give a hoot if I complained so I asked for a to go box and finished baking it at home. 

There's no reason that I would come back to this Westshore Pizza. It didn't look like a single person that works there was doing anything except for the girl behind the counter who was trying to keep busy by spraying already clean counters w stinky disinfectant cleaner 2 feet from where I was standing.

The sandwiches took about four minutes in their oven and can out hot and crisp. Overall they hade nice texture and flavor.

Beware that they use extra small to-go containers so the portions you get are much smaller than average. I took a regular sized container there and they said they would have to charge me more to use that one. I refuse to be overcharged for under portions of food....I will not go back! Also they are expensive for a food court joint.

"This is probably the best pizza I've had in Tampa. We decided to stop by on a whim after dropping by the mall for a quick return, and I'm SO glad we did.

We had a large pizza with the classic sauce, ricotta, Italian sausage, jalapenos, and onions. We did order bacon as well which was accidentally left off, but the pizza was so loaded with the other toppings it honestly didn't matter. Both our waitress and the manager still stopped by more than once to ask if we needed anything and apologize. It was a stark contrast to the service we got at another restaurant the night before, and it was much appreciated.

What can I say about the pizza that hasn't been said? The crust is the perfect balance or crispy and light, with a slightly sweet flavor. They go light on the sauce which I love, and they are extremely generous with the toppings. I mean, our pizza was just completely covered in toppings. I was barely able to take on two slices. Our waitress Mitzi was super nice and attentive. 

So, why four stars instead of five? It's really more of a 4.5. Mostly, I just wish they had more specialty options! The menu is a little limited. They had one specialty option(with chicken sausage and broccoli rabe), but I would just love to see what they would produce if they had some options similar to Mellow Mushroom.

Anyway, I might find myself making excuses to pop by the mall around lunch time. Will definitely be back.",32,C,Grimaldi's Pizzeria,Grimaldi's Pizzeria,Grimaldi's Pizz3ria,4.0,POSITIVE

"The word ""legit"" is overused. But this sandwich shop is definitely legit. I've been here twice this week and had fun experiences both times. 

During my first visit, I ordered the Cuban sandwich for which they're known. When you go inside, you can go straight to the register if you're planning to just get a sandwich. The lunch special includes a side--I got the big bowl of yellow rice and black beans. The sandwich was delicious. The food was fresh, well-prepared, and served in generous portions.

I asked the owner (Frank) about his favorite meal. He told me to return on Thursday to try the pigs' feet. So I did.... and... wow! Pigs' feet = lots of bone, small amounts of very tender meat. I can't say I was a big fan of the pigs' feet, but now I can eliminate ""eating pigs' feet"" from my bucket list. (Okay, they weren't on my bucket list but I'm adding them to my list of accomplishment nevertheless.) 

If you eat here, strike up a conversation with Frank. He seems like an awesome guy who is very passionate about this little hole-in-the-wall. He arrives super early every morning to prepare the daily specials. And, yes, they're open for breakfast at 6.30a every weekday morning.

"Arrived the Sunday before Christmas for lunch with my family. The place was empty. It was a little past noon and the weather was nice after a few days of miserable rain. So we asked to sit outside where there were about four tables of patrons to add to the two or three dining inside. The bowling alley wasn't busy either. While we were promptly seated, we waited at our table for minutes on end. No service. Then another family was seated and within a couple of minutes someone was at their table taking their drink orders. Several servers passed us, two even stepped outside to the patio and were talking and looking out at the courtyard. Still no service. We gave it almost three more minutes, on top of the almost ten we were already there, as we watched several servers walk past our table and fail to acknowledge we hadn't yet been helped--no drinks and open menus. So we got up and left. We weren't going to give them a chance. My children wanted to sit down and eat at a restaurant, never mind the cool options to eat at the Wharf. So we wound up at Hooter's, where my seven year old, yes seven year old was able to clearly verbalize how much better the service was there because within a minute of us being seated a server came by for our drink order.

Well, She stopped in, and I circled the block because parking was a total nightmare. I found an illegal spot to wait on her, and she came back out with two lattes and a croissant.

"Went here as it's closer than the Palma Ceia location, albeit neither are too far of a distance.  Tend to only come on the rare occasion my husband has a hankering for wings. In the past, we've had questionable service and were hoping that this had improved, as it's been at least  a year since the last visit. We quickly realized things have remain unchanged, if not worse.

We weren't sure if we needed to wait to be seated or seat ourselves as there wasn't a sign or staff around, so we sat ourselves near the entrance. Server eventually came to our table and meals came quickly enough. Husband eventually needed a refill and we both looked around occasionally (5 mins or so), no sight of our server. I finally got up and walked over to who appeared to be the manager and requested the refill. Came shortly after by our original server.  Not sure where she had been?  When we were ready to pay the bill, again, no server in sight - waited for quite some time (again) and finally gave up and walked up to the bar to have them sign us out. It was hardly a busy night, it was actually fairly empty, so that was not a possible factor into the poor service.  

If the food was great, I would have given another star, but my food, coupled with the terrible service is just unacceptable.  Husband said wings were ok, while my food and our app left much to be desired. I know I will not return and not sure if I will even go to another location.

I am very perceptive about ethnic food.  I can tell the difference between the real thing and the thing they water down for commercial audiences in the US.  The cooking and seasoning here are the real deal, meaning it's flavorful and strong, not weak. 

It's not about being hot and spicy (unless we are taking Mexican).  It's about being well seasoned and flavorful.  The food here is certainly that.   The Lumpia was nice and crispy.   The pork on the Manila Nachos was delicious, although I'm accustomed to nachos that are more loaded.

My girlfriend had never been to the famous Oxford Exchange, so we ventured on over to cross a restaurant off her bucket list. Unfortunately for some reason, Oxford Exchange had an insanely long hour wait on a Sunday afternoon. I guess I don't hang around this area enough to know how popular it really is. 

Luckily, the gf spotted OE Market while we were looking for parking, so we walked on over. I was a bit skeptical, based on the price for some of the juices in the cooler. Some of them were like $10-$20, which non-literally, left a bad taste in my mouth.

But I ordered the JR sandwich, because anything with red meat and horse radish is always going to be an obvious choice for me. The result? One of the best 2-3 sandwiches available in Tampa Bay. I just could not believe how perfect it was. 

And just like you'll find at the original OE, you can score the freshly cut, sweet potato ""chips,"" which are heavenly.

"We moved to Wesley Chapel in January and one of the selling points is the many many golf courses.  My hubby is an avid golfer and we also are an active family, so having full access to a course with unlimited golf and fitness was hugely appealing.  Additionally, there is a Kids Club where we get 2 hours included a day of childcare.

Right now (as of June 1st) the entire tennis athletic area is being renovated. They are adding a small put put course, water slide and splash pad.  They are gutting the restaurant and adding a brick over pizza option to the grille and putting in cabanas around the pool, which is heated year round.

Because we are under 40, we get a special rate and for us, it is worth it, especially with the social aspect. There are nightly specials at Fazios, they just redid the menu and the staff is amazing.

It is also VERY family friendly which makes it nice since our kiddos are super young and a bit obnoxious.  We like that it has a ""Cheers"" feel at the bar, and familiar faces are always around.  We hope to be able to make friends and grow business network connections as well as enjoy lots of fun activities all summer long.  

I would say the one thing I would like to see is a bit better wine list on the main menu, but outside of that, it is wonderful.

"This is only my second experience eating at a Columbian restaurant,  so bear with me as I learn more about the food and what to order.
I ordered the combination plate which came with a salad, a big mound of white rice, a corn cake, a grilled hanger steak, plantains, a chorizo sausage and what looked like a blood sausage, but wasn't.
Ok, like I said I need to learn how to order, next to me were beautiful shrimp and specialty rice, on the other side some yummy looking cheese dish.
First all my food was great and well prepared. The restaurant itself is beautiful with wall murals and homemade pottery. I dined with a table of fellow YELPER'S,  so that is always fun.
My expectations were off about the Columbian food. I expected the sausages to be spicy or have some kick and that just wasn't on my plate. The salad and rice were naked...no toppings or dressings. There is nothing wrong with this, once again my expectations were nust plain wrong. 
I enjoyed the  meats and nice caramelized plantains very much. Personally I felt the naked rice and salad were a waste as I never eat them like that. I am learning about Columbian food and learned  last night from my fellow YELPER'S things that will help me in ordering better choices the next time.
The restaurant is great and I heard no complaints from anyone about their food.  Unfortunately due to my lack of knowledge and poor ordering, I have to take away a star. I am quite sure on a return visit I will be able to give that extra star.

"After my most recent visit to Poke Falls, I felt like I had to update my review and drop it to 4 stars. The food is still fresh and delicious - however, the portion sizes for their proteins seems to decrease upon every visit. This time I requested 3 proteins (all the same) and when I got home and opened the package it looked more like 1 protein serving. This has happened on my last several visits, so I not it is not a one-time issue - I waited to update to see if the prior visits were flukes. 

I wish they would quantify the ""serving"" size for the proteins so we know that we should be getting what we order (and pay for) - is each protein serving a 1/4 cup? 3 ounces? It seems like it varies and has been on a swift decline over the last few months.

Took my cup, and went to the single drink dispenser.. and no cherry coke, it was greyed out. So I tried regular coke... same, no coke. 

I went to the counter and let them know they were out of some drinks, and the response was ""yea, we know""! Really?

Got my sandwich and fries. No ketchup or salt, or napkins available anywhere in the entire place, you have to ask for it at the counter.

Opened my sandwich and did a double take... the menu picture of this sandwich shows a meat patty that is a lovely golden brown, and bigger than the bun... this patty looked burnt and was about half the size of the bun. I took it back and asked for a manager. 2nd try... slightly better... not much (see images I uploaded).

Their little muffins they bring you are great and the service is TOP NOTCH. When that happens I don't mind paying the required 18% gratuity. Every time I eat at a place that has a required tip the wait staff is always superb. Maybe more places should start doing this??

"The meals have been generally good, but not at the top of the chain steakhouse list, particularly when factoring the top-dollar prices.  On my most recent visit, I had a filet which was tender, but not particularly flavorful.  I don't believe they season their filets, although if they do, it is too light.  One person had the bone-in ribeye, which was excellent, juicy, and flavorful.  The third person had one of the specials: filet with lobster meat on top.  The lobster meat really didn't add anything worth the extra cost, and it actually took away from the steak.  The lobster was bland and looked like it had been minced.  For appetizers, we had the calamari tossed in hot peppers, which was excellent and a huge portion.  One person had the lobster bisque, and he proclaimed it was delicious.  For sides, the hash browns were very nice, with a  creamy texture and large; the asparagus was average, as was the sauteed spinach.  Overall: good, pricey, with excellent service and a pretty nice atmosphere.

"What a treat!!!  I'm so glad we chose this place.  A friend and I were catching up after some major life events and told our friend, Sadie (I'll call her friend because she was so much more like a friend than a server), that we'd be a while.  She was totally cool with us taking our time (*ahem* we were there 3 hours!)

We ordered the egg rolls and tuna mini tacos for appetizers.  I did not try the tacos but my friend loved them.  I also loved the egg rolls.

For drinks, I ordered the tropical depression. It took me a minute to get used to the flavor, but then I *really* liked it!  Sadie took note that I had mentioned I like spicy food and asked me if I wanted her to tell the bartender to put in some muddled jalapeño in the next one.  Why yes I would, thank you very much!  My friend had the lavender drink and loved it as well.  I was going to order that, and after trying hers, I can say that's a great choice as well.

The entrees were truly the star of the show however.  I ordered the pork tacos expecting some run of the mill carnitas.  Oh no no no!  These were easily the best pork tacos I've ever had.  They didn't need anything, they were perfect.  My friend had the short ribs upon our friend Sadie's recommendation and she loved her entree as well.

The restrooms are gender neutral and clean and I feel it important to mention that they have Dyson hand dryers!  That's right!  Not only were my hands dried lickety split, but my hair was whipping in the wind as well!  (OK I'm a bit of a Dyson nerd)

Anyway... this place is cool and so are the people.  And the food is phenomenal.",4,A,Mekenita Cantina,Mekenita Cantina,Mekenit@ C@ntin@,5.0,POSITIVE
"I hate to sound elitist or high and mighty, but I was really uninspired by their food. 

It can't be doubted for a second that the service is excellent, the cashier was more than willing to go over all the items and the pricing for me. After I had gotten my sub he eve came out again and asked if I needed anything. I just wish the food was as good as the service. 

I ordered the French Dip sub which was just roast beef, Swiss, and an au jus. I added lettuce bc I was pretending to be healthy. 

When it came out, again, I was asked if I needed anything. Finally I dug in. It was warm, and the sauce was warm, it just... Didn't work. The roast beef didn't have much flavor and the sauce didn't add anything to it. It made my sandwich wet, and that's it. The bread was boring. It was all just so sad. I want to like this place, I really do! They even cleared my table for me and got me a refill on my drink. But this sandwich was so ordinary 

I could be biased because my boyfriend's family is from New Orleans. And I'm used to authentic. So maybe I'll try one more time, but with a cold sandwich!",33,C,Lenny's Sub Shop,Lenny's Sub Shop,Lenny's Sub Shop,3.0,NEGATIVE

"A very good seafood to-go shop.  Also sells a limited list of fresh fish/shrimp, but the business driver is fried seafood, well cooked with good sides, nice combo meals, low prices and some unique items.    There are a few tables for eat-in, but mostly occupied by customers waiting for take-out, and the decor would not induce you to linger.  Clean and bright, but very utilitarian.  Specials include a fried mullet lunch with 3 sides for $5.99...and sides include the usuals.....slaw, greens, fries, hushpuppies, beans, etc.   Unique items include fried conch as a dinner or by the pound.  
This is one of the few places you can get smoked mullet....an old-time Florida favorite.  They do it well.....good smoke taste improved by seasoning, and smoked til done yet still moist....so not dry like beef jerky.     This is a dish for people who truly like the taste of fish, not those who look for fish that tastes like anything but.

The shop is located on the south bank of the river on 40th Street......a part of town that does not bet much Yelp attention and is not blessed with lots of fine eateries...but this one is worth a try by fish-eaters...and not just on Good Friday.",38,C,Riverside Seafood Market,Riverside Seafood Market,riverside seafood market,3.0,POSITIVE

"I would never consider eating lunch in a restaurant in a department store, but, after all, this is Nordstrom and it has great reviews on Yelp. We were not disappointed. 

I tried the chicken paillard, pounded chicken breast with arugula, red onion, and cherry tomatoes tossed in a lemon balsamic vinaigrette. It was delicious. Our server was very conscientious and kept filling ans refilling our iced tea. 

Sophia tried a not-on-the-menu lunch special of pasta tossed with chicken sausage and fennel. Delightful!

It's a wonderfully upscale environment,  as you might expect. Filled with happy and hungry shoppers, Bazille has a nice vibe conducive to eating and enjoying food.

This is no food court emporium. Sitting in Bazille, you would never guess that a department store was steps away. By the way, the menu was varied with sandwiches, salads and hot entrees. Plus gourmet pizza (the pizza served at the next table looked fabulous). Next time we shop at International Plaza, we'll stop for lunch here again.",2,A,Bazille,Bazille,Bazill3,5.0,POSITIVE

I can't say I've ever had to add salt because of a lack of flavor to anything involving a sub(until now).  Even worse, it was the Chipotle chicken, which should have been packed with flavor....  If that one was that bland, I would hate to see what the turkey sub is like.

"I was feeling lazy, and did not want to cook! It does happen, right? And I wanted meat... grilled tasty meat! I was thinking maybe Churrasco... or Mediterranean Kabobs.  And then I remembered I had bookmarked Perdigon El Sabor... and it had good reviews. I love any kind of Latin food... and some of the Latin countries do some awesome things with a grill, and some meat and skewers!

Grabbed the girlfriend, and off we went. The location is really close to us, and fairly easy to find. Nice on the inside, if a bit small... but it was cozy! A large TV on the wall was cycling images of the various dishes, and they looked wonderful. Another screen in the corner was showing an ad for an advertising company, but was also showing some food pics too, and not too blatant or annoying.

Service was good...  we got water, and batidos right away. Ordered some Calamari for an appetizer, and it was delicious... crispy chunks of yummy squid, and two wonderful sauces to dip it in.

Then the main courses arrived. And they are beautifully presented, and are just mouth watering to look at.. much less eat! Girlfriend had ordered the Parilla de Venezolana and I had ordered the Parilla Mar y Tierra. It was a small mountain of well cooked meat and seafood... with an aroma that was heavenly. The grilled shrimp (two skewers) were the best grilled shrimp I have ever had in a restaurant, absolutely delicous. The beef and pork were also very good... the chicken was bit dry, but definitely edible. The Chorizo was delicious! The Tostones served with were good also. The citrus sauce and pico de gallo were very good too.

The mango Batido's we had were excellent... and if they had only had a bit of rum in them, OMG!  :) 

We did not do the desserts, as there was no room left... but I do want to try the flan and the Tres Leches cake... I love them, and will just have to take them home with me, next time!

"Hands down some of the best pizza I've had in Tampa! I've lived here for going on 8yrs and I'm kind of kicking myself for just now trying this spot - but better late than never, right?

This pizzeria is located right off Fletcher Ave., just a minute or two from USF. When I went, they were getting ready to close down for renovations starting the following day, so I can't really be critical of the interior conditions or disarray due to that.

I ordered one small 5-cheese and one small Seafood pizza. And OMG...I can't say enough good things about them!! They are generous with their cheese, so both came out piled with melty goodness. They seem to bake their crusts a bit longer, achieving a wonderfully crunchy outside, but slightly chewy inside. The Seafood pizza is topped with crab and I believe shrimp as well - and it seriously tastes just like garlic/seafood scampi pasta...but as a pizza! And what made the 5-cheese pizza for me was that on top of all those gooey cheeses, they place random dollop of creamy ricotta cheese, and it is just flavor and texture perfection!

Great flavorful pizzas, friendly service - whenever they reopen from renovating, I'd highly recommend giving them a try!",28,C,ABC Pizza,ABC Pizza,ABCPizza,5.0,NEGATIVE

Eats is a hidden gem. From the outside it doesn't look like much and gives off a tacky look but the food is solid. They have a massive menu and their prices are extremely fair. They have a full bar with great drink prices. On Mondays they have the $5 Burger which is a substantial burger. You have to add on extra for toppings but it's a great deal. They often have a Groupon available as well. There a lot of flat screen TVs but the restaurant is rather small and dingy. The staff is very friendly and helpful but they should probably wash and press their uniforms better. The parking lot is small but it's never too busy that you can't find a spot. One of the menu items was featured on the Food Network - that's their fried pork chop sandwich and it is to die for. Be sure to check out the desserts as well.

"This place is a gem that you would normally drive by because it's in the middle of Jack-shack city. It's right across from a place that's called the Playhouse theater which is an adult theater/gay bathhouse. So be aware that the location is downright terrible, because being in the middle of Drew Park is seedy business pun intended. So, I put my trust in Google to suggest someplace new for me to eat today and it brought me here.

No one here speaks English so if you can't communicate with basic knowledge in Spanish it might be difficult for you to order food. Me being a huge food lover I have no issues with this, because I can order food in almost any language. 

One last thing to get out of the way. Not only is the location terrible but the building is a tad bit dumpy and dirty. 

I must say though the food shines and it came out fast plus the service was good. I got three tacos, rice, and beans for $7.99. The barbacoa meat was exquisite and Juicy.

"This is a review of the casino. my daughter and I wanted a fun day out without my grandson. We decided to go here. Never again, this place is not worth the time or money. We drove an hour, even thou it stated 45 mins. We parked in the garage, later when we asked what garage, we said the white one, she said they all have white which one did you park in. What a joke, they named all the garages with the same colors. We then had to wait to get our cards, but in a smoke ridden room, I will be surprised if I don't get cancer from the second hand smoke, it was awful. We then went and found the smoke free section, where we learned that there was no games at all to play that cost less than $1 a row, there were hundreds of games in the smoking section but non in the none smoking section. We started to play, and asked for a complimentary drink of soda, we waited 45 min never received our complimentary soda and walked to another sec, which again we asked for our complimentary soda, 30 min later we were still waiting, we had hit our limit within 10 mins since not one single game in the non smoking section was less than $1 a line to play, and we waited now more than 1hr 30 m8.

Yes, you can find some of their goods at the bigger Asian supermarkets, but you can NOT get a tray of fresh uni (just shipped in from Santa Barbara) or specialty Haku soy sauce, at the typical Asian supermarket. The uni was expensive but that's the price for the heaven in your mouth. I haven't had fresh high grade uni in Tampa. I think you have to follow their Facebook/IG to see what specialty fresh ingredients they have. I'm looking forward to going back to try their poke bowls and I'm planning to one day check out their main Omakase restaurant around the corner.",4,A,Noble Market,Noble Market,Nobl3 Mark3t,5.0,NEGATIVE

"I don't write reviews that often, but when I do, it's either for a place you should avoid, or a place you should frequent. Alas, the rating has already stole my thunder, so you know which way this review is going.

I love Thai food. I've been a Thai aficionado for over 20 years, so I've eaten at a variety of Thai restaurants across the country, from California to NJ, but mostly across Florida. This place is located in a gas station strip mall, along with several other restaurants, which does not give the best vibe, but as soon as you walk thru the door, it changes quick. I scanned the place, Thai Buddhas, check. Thai shrine, check. Thai lady servers, check. Quick look at the menu, papaya salad, check. Ok, I'm in. 

I have two dishes by which I judge every Thai restaurant. Tom Kha Gai soup and Pad Thai. I ordered the Tom Kha Gai with our drink order, and was pleasantly surprised they had ginger tea. I failed to mention I've been nursing a head cold, so I was looking forward to the therapeutic effects of these two items. The soup was good, had a nice hint of lime with a slight touch of spice. What it did not have, at least to my taste buds, was coconut. I called the server over and asked if this was Tom Kha or Tom Yum, and she said it was Tom Kha. The lack of coconut milk / cream was made up by the overall balance of the soup. My sinuses felt better after I couple of sips.

I ordered the Roast Duck Noodle Soup, which is not one of my normal ""go to"" Thai items, but again, I'm nursing a head cold and soup sounds awesome right now. And, what the hell, let's throw in an order of Pad Thai, not because I'm hungry, but because I want to do a full-on appraisal of this place. Dad ordered the Amazing Duck, which was essential a Thai style sweet and sour crispy duck dish with a good amount of veggies. 

The soup was basically a Duck Pho, and it was one of the best Pho dishes I've ever had (I love Vietnamese food as well. I also love putting side note in parentheses, but I digress.) Dad's Amazing Duck, which I had a taste, was a dish worth noting. And the Pad Thai? Let's talk Pad Thai for a quick moment. Either it's on the sweet side, appealing to American tastes, or it's on the sour side. This Pad Thai was a very nice balance, with just a hint of sweetness mixed in with the lime and peanut. Oh, and instead of choosing, it comes mixed with chicken and shrimp, a nice touch.

You'll most likely see a bunch of newer reviews on this place, because they are offering 10% off your meal if you write up a review and show them before your check comes to the table. Excellent marketing. Now, did I partake of this discount? Yes, and I've come home to flush out the review. Why? Because this is one of the more authentic Thai restaurants I've been to, the food was excellent, service was good, and the place was empty. That make my heart a bit empty, because I *know* Bonefish up the road is packed every single night, and this place deserves the same. 

So, if you're in the area, and you're wanting really good Thai food (they have Chinese style dishes as well), please give them your patronage. Don't expect over-the-top Americanized service. The ladies do the best they can, in a friendly manner. I think you'll enjoy the experience.",24,B,Thai Lanna & Sushi,Thai Lanna & Sushi,Thai Lanna & Sushi,5.0,POSITIVE

"I feel a moral obligation to write this review. 

My husband and I had dinner here last Sunday, we arrived at dinner time and the place was a ghost town (should have been a clue) the service was good heck even the food tasted good however shortly after eating the appetizer my stomach became irritated. I didn't think much of it I figured I ate to fast. I was to full to eat any of my dinner so I had it boxed to take home. My husband on the other hand ate his meal which was grilled chicken. We paid the bill and headed home (which is only 15 minutes away). We didn't even get halfway home when suddenly my husband started getting severe stomach pain then he became increasingly nauseous. Luckily we made it home without any real troubles... that came later. My poor husband was in and out of bathroom all night. 

Now... I can't say for certain that he got food poisoning because he didn't see a doctor and we didn't get the food tested in a lab but in my opinion and his he got food poisoning.

"4.5 but rounding up. Expensive but I don't mind paying for unique and tasty dishes. I did find a hair in one of my dishes but I'm pretty sure all restaurants have this problem / all are kind gross in my germaphobe perspective, and I know I overanalyze my food so notice this more than those that just dig in, so I'm not gonna blackball them for it. 

- wood-grilled butternut squash, almond crunch mole butter, avocado crema, charred lime - holy shit this was delicious. I wish I ordered two. Everything was great. Great balance of texture. I think there were some nuts and goat cheese on it. The avocado crema and the mole butter were sooooo good! 

- crispy patatas bravas, fermented black bean tomato sauce, whipped binchotan aioli - not crispy but I was a little late in picking up my order so I'm sure that was part of it. I didn't care for the tomato sauce. It wasn't bad, just didn't add the right flavors for me. The aioli was food. I think they added an everything but the bagel seasoning and it was a fantastic touch IMO. 

- ras el hanout spiced wood fired globe artichokes celery root tahini puree, preserved lemon brown butter, morrocan tomato jam, almond dukkah - pretty good but not sure I'd reorder. Maybe. 

- warm country sourdough for two artichoke parmesan butter - I received a tiny bit of this artichoke butter. It was ok. Nothing special. Wouldn't order it again.

"The Pho Truck has been visiting our apartment complex lately so I have now had the chance to grab dinner from them on three separate occasions. I always enjoy talking to the owner. He is very friendly and seems very passionate about Vietnamese cuisine. 

My favorite items on the menu are the fried dumplings and Bún Tht Nng (Vietnamese Grilled Pork & Vermicelli Rice Noodles). The dumplings are hands-down some of the best dumplings I have had in Tampa. I always regret not ordering a second order of the dumplings. The grilled pork in the Bún Tht Nng has tons of flavor and this is one of the most filling dishes on the menu since it includes a fried egg roll. This dish is a steal at less than $9!

The Pho isn't my favorite because it doesn't include all of the garnishes that you usually receive in a sit-down restaurant. My husband and I have tried the beef and the chicken pho and we both agree that the beef pho is the more flavorful of the two.

"Hey there yelpers, im here to do a honest cut down the middle real review. Here it goes :)

So when I walk in the staff asks me what my purpose there was. So I sit down and then the waiter pours the water. I went to the buffet table and I saw many assorted dishes.

On to the food lol. So my first plate grabbed paneer masala, i think a veg korma, dal tadka, idly manchurian, nan, rice and uttapham. So when I sit down and look at my plate my dal was green colored, i was a bit hesitant to eat green colored dal but it was just like regular dal. The veggie korma was unlike any ive had reminded me of some kinda gravy ive had, I could be wrong with the dish but that is what it reminded me. Now although some might say that the paneer masala had too much tamarind, I love how it challenged my tastebuds. It definately stands out alot. the idly manchurian reminded me of chinese food, like sweet and sour but thats indo-chinese for ya. The first time I ate the uttapham i will say it was between cold and warm no lie. Nan was very fried unlike any nan I had before, it was not really the way im used to my nan thats whatever. Rice was a ok.

Second round a grabbed more paneer masala yum, idly, and hot uttapham(this time) rice, and some butter aloo dish. It was actually not bad the aloo that is.

Lastly I tried the desserts. Well I had the rice pudding and plenty of rose water. But I like rosewater it was very sweet. Also I tried the carrot halwa, something about it i didnt really like as much compared to all the other ones I had. 

I know im being hard on this review but i've been to many indian restaurants. I am going to be very honest, I originally was going to go to either indian grill kennedy or bombay masala because of nothing but great reviews but due to convenience i tried taste of india and also an indian dude recommened it.

The main reason I am giving this place a 3 stars because of the service. All of the staff were VERY polite and worked hard to make all the food come together. So I can respect that. And when you see indian people go to an indian restaurant and eat that is usually an indicator that its ok. Now I didnt try too many things there so I cannot really speak for all of the dishes.

In retrospect, alright food, and great service, it was an ok experience.",10,A,Tamarind Indian Cuisine,Tamarind Indian Cuisine,Tamarind Indian Cuisine Inc.,3.0,NEGATIVE
"Had lunch here today: Yummy.

This place has been here 15 years or so, and could be easily overlooked. They are just open for breakfast and lunch M-F. Guess dinner never worked out. I used to live around the corner and we did have dinner there a few times in those days - what I had today was far better than I remember the place being then.

So: Food - delish. I opted for the Persian Stew - beef, pesto, beans, gravy and such, with fresh tomato, green pepper and onion slices added for color and flavor. Big pile of basamati rice and perfectly toasted bread with garlic/spice/olive oil for dipping or as a meat condiment. I did both.

Problems: The food came out cold. The rice was perfect, but the stew was - less than tepid. Sent back, heated in the oven, epic hot plate on return - it kinda took away from the texture and over cooked the rice a tad, but still for 8.95 was a good dish. 

Also: Heavy handed on the salt. PEOPLE! I can add salt, but I cannot subtract it. Stop with the over seasoning.

Seems they do a bang up breakfast biz, and lunch is second (If i understood the waitress right - she seemed to be having an off day)

Verdict: very good, could be great. 

Aside: Two other patrons were served what looked like an amazing mixed chicken salad and a wonderful hamburger. Gotta try those next time.",26,B,Ruby Cafe,Ruby Cafe,Ruby C@fe,4.0,POSITIVE

"One star is honestly being kind. This place needs to get it together because they will be the next out of business restaurant in that location if they don't do something to improve.

I chose this place because they had no wait. I knew as soon as the hostess sat us in the back we'd be treated as yesterdays forgotten lunch. Considering it was a Saturday evening, the restaurant was not full and plenty of open tables I should have been way better attended to!! 

The servers move at a snails pace. For a restaurant I have never seen service staff move that slow! Especially for a half filled restaurant. Additionally two men I'm assuming management or owners were just walking around aimlessly taking up space and not helping at all. The busser was the only one that kinda seemed to know what to do as far as helping tables. The whole time I was sitting there I could not wait to post this review because people really may want to consider how unfavorable the restaurant is.

The hostess took our drink order and I put in an order for my daughter's meal with the hostess. A different server brought us our drinks. Then 20 minutes later a server asked me if I wanted to order something else besides the kids meal. I asked her if my daughter's steak order was in she said yes and I ordered crab dip too. Ten minutes later the dip came out. No sign of a kid's steak. 

The crab dip we devoured only because we were starving. I knew it was gonna be a hit or miss with crab dip. It was tasty but it honestly seemed like a pile of cream cheese. Plus we were hungry waiting almost a half hour after ordering to actually get food. I don't think there was actually crab in the ""crab dip"". It also was Luke warm when it came out as though the dip had been sitting or just not heated up thoroughly.

Someone I don't know if it was the hostess or our server forgot to put my daughter's kids meal order in because I had to remind 3 people about it after we were finished the dip. The server didn't even apologize for forgetting she just tried to act like it happened to take 45 minutes for a kid's meal. I even saw her tell the management guy what happened. I've been a server so I knew exactly what was going on. I mean the staff was friendly but they we EXTREMELY inexperienced and just sucked as far as being personable.

Considering my total was $26 it was not a worthwhile experience at all. The menu is pricey so I expected to be treated way better as a customer. I would NOT recommend this place at all if you want quality food and service. I guarantee this restaurant won't last another six months. I hate to say it but these people need to make a drastic change. The fact that all the other restaurants had wait times on a Saturday night and this place had plenty of open tables is a huge reflection of what to expect.

The kids meal was ok when it came out. The steak was super thin. The kids meal is over priced at $10 a plate and it doesn't include a drink. 

I wanted to walk out even before we got our food that's how bad I felt as a customer here. I had already ordered so I stayed but it was not worth our time or money at all. Very overpriced menu too! 

I do hope for the sake of the economy amd because I'm sure someone wants Alma to be successful, I do hope they can improve because this place is hopeless as far as I can tell.",24,B,ALMA Rest And Bar,ALMA Rest And Bar,ALMA Rest And B@r,1.0,NEGATIVE

"The food's nothing special but the setting is nice.  It's really nice to sit outside on the beach where the bartenders are the best servers in the establishment.  We had typical beach bar drinks, my mojito was fine, grouper sandwich was okay, made for a nice few hours hanging around without any work to do.  It's much better to arrive just as they open, the crowd doesn't come until just after noon and long before then we had the best seats at the bar.  This has to be the most child friendly bar (the outside, ""barefoot bar"" part) in town.  I feel sorry for the wait-staff hopping the tables in the sand, a workout with platters of food and drink with small fast moving obstacles (i.e. children) in the sun, and yet I couldn't help notice some cheap tipping going on around me.

"Portillo's, originally called The Dog House, started out in a 12 foot trailer in 1963 on a bustling corner in Villa Park, Illinois. This quintessential Chicago staple, now serving in Indiana, Arizona, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Florida & California, is an uber efficient American restaurant chain that specializes in serving Chicago-style food such as Hot Dogs, Maxwell Street Polish, Italian Beef, Burgers, Salads and the iconic Chocolate Cake Shake. Here's the rundown on the Italian Beef-this juicy monster of a sandwich, known as ""Chicago's #1 Beef"" is about the size of an average man's head, and there is absolutely no shame in devouring every last bite. I suggest adding some zesty giardiniera & melted Mozzarella cheese...or in Portillo's terms....""hot with mozz"". The Hot Dog with ""Everything"" includes yellow mustard, neon green relish, celery salt, freshly chopped onions, sliced red ripened tomatoes, a hefty kosher pickle spear and hot sport peppers piled high into a perfectly steamed poppy seed bun.

I ordered the mini Cuban with the small soup I ask the waitress for samples of there beans soups, she gave me free samples of the bean soup's which to me in my opinion I have been to Cuba I have been to Cuban restaurants in New York City also California and it was disgusting. All of the soups that I tried including the chicken and rice soup was terrible. I don't know who is cooking in the back there but not only was the soup horrible which I actually sent back but the sandwich barely had any pork in it this Sandwich shop needs to definitely get some new management and some new cooks, and New Recipes..

"Two stars because I just feel bad. The vibe and menu is all very confused. I don't know what chef would think that a menu with this much variety would work. How do you focus your skills?

We accepted the Yelp offer for a free appetizer and got the curry mussels. The sauce was okay but these were definitely frozen mussels. About four of them weren't open and they didn't taste fresh. 

Server didn't know anything about the beers, kept pushing the ""blonde ale from St. Pete"" which I insisted was the Beach Blonde from 3 daughters, to which she had no reaction. 

For dinner, my roommate got pastitsio and I got the special flatbread, which was Thai Chicken. The pastitsio was very bland. Just nowhere near worth the price. The Thai Flatbread definitely had Purdue chicken strips on it, you know the kind that come in the plastic in the refrigerated section? They just tasted dirty. Also had big strips of jalapeno on it, which I thought were probably green peppers but was in for a surprise when I bit in; and I like spicy stuff!

"So here's the thing, my husband and I visited this place while on a weekend away and we sadly used a Groupon which was a bigger deal than I thought. BEFORE we visited this restaurant we called and made sure there were no restrictions with using a Groupon and made sure they were accepted. We got to the restaurant and felt lost. Lol. Someone saw us looking confused and finally directed us that seats are available in the back. We finally sat down and our server greeted us and before we ordered we AGAIN mentioned our Groupon, she then told us that they accept it. We ordered but our food took a while to get to us. Our drinks were never filled and it took a awhile for our server to pay us some attention. The service was ehhh. We had to ask for our bill otherwise we probably would have been sitting there for another 30 minutes. Anyway, we finally left and was walking to our car when this guy, who I think was the manger, came up to our car and told us that he did us a favor by accepting our Groupon and that we had ""a free night out."" Our server already had passed that information on to us, letting us know that her manager ""did us a favor."" Let's be clear though, our dinner was not free, we paid Groupon before hand. It just rubbed us the wrong way by how he went about telling us. We were planning to head out after we ate but something about the food just did not sit well with our stomachs.

Half an hour later, a delivery person was at my door with the food.

Please understand this isn't American! It's very unique and they experiment with different flavors with really delicious ingredients. The condiments are made in house and seriously get the chipotle mayo. Don't be scared, and try the Lithuanian bread sticks. Be warned it's Lithuanian bread (similar to pumpernickel) with light salt and doused in butter served with the cheesiest in house blue cheese dressing. changed my life! The salmon burger is insanely delicious with always decadent and generous portions of salmon on this insane potato bread bun. Honestly, words don't do it justice.

After waiting even longer for them to search and search, each time disappearing into the kitchen, we were told that the order was never put in and that it would be another 30 mins to one hour for the food.  We left empty handed, without even so much as an apology!   I have never been treated so rudely at any establishment.  Needless to say Jasmine Thai is off my list.

A lot of the things you can find on their menu, you can find elsewhere too and probably taste better. But it's okay for cheap food. I ordered 10 wings for 8.99 and it was okay.

"Nice little hidden gem at the backside of International Plaza near Nordstrom. It is accessible from Bay Street, but easier to get to if you park near the Renaissance Hotel. You can have them valet your car, and then have the restaurant validate your valet ticket, as well. Signs clearly mark the restaurant. Make sure to use Open Table for your reservation, as they often give 1,000 pts for booking at this restaurant, especially during the weeknight evenings. They also aren't ever overly busy, so you can dine in peace. 

I've come here with my book club ladies on two occasions and come for a date night on another two occasions. Each time, the drinks were great and the food was delicious. My favorite is the brussel sprout salad, which sounds gross but is a masterpiece. Must try! Their flatbreads are also really good, and they have some very rich pastas in many varieties. 

On one of my visits, they were having a problem with fruit flies (hopefully that has since been taken care of). It was pretty bad. They were getting in our wine (which the waitress replaced), and were even in one of our salads. Yuck. The manager came and gave our table this huge dessert spread for the inconvenience. Then, at some point someone pulled a fire alarm, which didn't seem to phase anyone but us. We still aren't sure if that was a tactic to get us to leave!

I can understand having fries made if you have a line of people waiting, but I was the only person there.

"Wanted to try a new pizza place, and Hanks was close, and highly rated. It is ok inside... pretty basic, but clean. Smells really good with the pies coming out of the oven. They had a small selection of pizzas ready that you could buy by the slice... and it looked decent.

Staff was friendly and helpful. 

House salads are very basic, but very large... lot of green lettuce (not iceberg, so at least healthy), 2 cherry tomatoes, a couple slices of cucumber, and lots of onion. 

Pizza looked and smelled great when delivered to the table. First slice was yummy, not heavy on the toppings or sauce, but adequate. Crust is sort of thin to medium very soft crust, only crispy on the edges.  Second slice was soggy about halfway through... and was not nearly as good. That was all I had... the slices are large...and I hate soggy pizza. Took the rest home and will preheat my stone and heat it up that way... hopefully cook some of the sogginess out of it. 

They also keep it pretty cool in the place (probably cause the cooking area is hot), and there are ceiling fans all over... so the pizza does not stay hot very long on the aluminum pans they use.

"As any frequent reviewer of my posts know, I like to periodically (annually) re-review my reviews as things can change. Sometimes businesses close, get bad, or sometimes, better. This is one of those posts. Yes, I know I've been bad about checking in, but I just had a son, so I've been a bit busy. Plus, since the Pandemic, we've been getting deliveries from here more than actually picking stuff up.

TPA is my secret to traveling to Disney on the cheap. Eventually, there will be a train option here, but until then, you can usually get a much cheaper airplane ticket to TPA. Then, you can rent a car to drive to Orlando. For those that rent cars anyway, it's a win-win. Plus, it's only about a 1-hour drive, which is definitely doable. Once the train option is active, for those that do not want to rent a car, this will solve it. And, depending on the travel costs from your home location, it still may be cheaper.

But, I digress. This review should be about TPA, not the fact that it's a hidden travel cost saver. This is a normal airport terminal with the standard lengthy TSA line, but it is MUCH shorter than the Orlando airport, which is always packed.

The food options are Starbucks, Chick-fil-A, Burger 21, and Pei Wei. There may be a few other options, but those are the ones I remember. Of course, there is plenty of seating, but unfortunately, no lounge. Not having a lounge is terrible, but if you save money flying through here, who cares?

Mitmita is no exception. We dropped by here for an early dinner late one afternoon after seeing the rave reviews here on Yelp. It had been more than a year since I had eaten Ethiopian and to say that I was long overdue is an understatement. Nonetheless, we had already scanned the menu prior to arriving and knew we would be getting the sampler to share. As a last minute decision, we got the veggie sambusas too. For those who have never eaten Ethiopian food before, not only are you missing out but let me let you in on a little secret: you will NEVER leave hungry. Although several of the dishes are vegetarian, even carnivores like me are blown away by the flavor packed in each scoop. The injera is so good that you end up eating way more than you'd think, too. Lastly, the service here was top notch. Athena was warm, helpful, and kind throughout the entire dining experience. The decor of the place also complemented the cultural dining experience at Mitmita.

"--- Short Synopsis ---

Cena has great quality food. I would just come here for their awesome and interesting take on a tiramisu alone, but they also serve other amazing dishes, like the seafood risotto.
 
--- Detailed Summary ---

I was able to find some parking across the street next to Cena. Inside Cena, there is a open and modern feel to the place. Our server was a helpful and kind gentlemen.

I came here for restaurant week and my girlfriend opted for the three course option for restaurant week. I also ordered three (separate) dishes because there was so much I wanted to try.

The complimentary bread is good and comes with the usual olive oil and balsamic vinegar, so i cannot really argue with that. The bread also goes really well with any (leftover) sauces you may have from your other dishes.

For appetizers, I was able to try their calamari and octopus scachatta. I never had octopus on a scachatta before and it was delightful. The dish was tasty with the tomato sauce, sausage, spinach, cheese, and octopus. The calamari was not bad as well. The squid ink aioli and salsa (pico de gallo) were interesting accompaniments to the calamari. The pico de gallo had a nice spicy kick to it from the jalapenos. 

For entrees, I got the seafood (shrimp and scallops) risotto and got to try the wild game meatballs with polenta and garlic broccolini. Both were rich and had great flavor. For the risotto, it had a nice creamy/cheesy texture and flavor and the seafood was seared nicely. The wild game meatball was delicious!  

For dessert, I got tiramisu and was able to try the restaurant week's watermelon grattachecca with pistachios and lime sorbet. Both were not bad, but the tiramisu absolutely took the ""cake"" over the other dessert.

Cena's take on the tiramisu is awesome! It is interesting and I absolutely loved it! The mascarpone mousse with the soaked cookie in a ellipsoidal shape was cool, but the taste is even better. The taste is not too sweet, but has good flavor. The (thin) outside layer was like a light vanilla bean mochi texture/flavor. The small crunchy coffee crumbles provide a good texture contrast. Also, the cookie inside the mascarpone is not soaked or soggy, which is sometimes a problem with some tiramisus I have had. A great dish overall.",40,C,Cena,Cena,Cena,5.0,POSITIVE

"Since Trattoria168 is located inside the same building as The Clarion Hotel & Conference Center, it is conveniently located for anyone staying there in a room. I found this place on Groupon, so I came here for a late dinner with my boyfriend in December 2015.

When we went, the place was dead. The cliché attempt at Italian decor looked pretty low-budget: a checkered red-and-white tablecloth, fold-up chairs, among other things. Oh well, I'm more concerned about the food. I liked how they started us off with a small loaf of ciabatta bread with a seasoned olive oil dipping sauce. I'm a sucker for bread, and the dipping sauce was delicious!

I ordered the Mediterranean Shrimp Scampi pasta ($17) and my boyfriend ordered a Meatball Parmigiana sandwich with french fries ($9). The food was alright. My linguine pasta was underwhelming, even with the sauce (comprised of garlic butter, olive oil, lemon, and white wine). For me, the sauce was too fluid/liquid-y. It tasted like it was made with too much olive oil and not enough other seasonings (like garlic butter). There were 8 shrimp on top, and they were a pretty good size. Brownie points to Trattoria168 for serving the dish with de-tailed shrimp! So many other restaurants serve shrimp with tails on, and it drives me crazy.

At the end, we ordered a chocolate lava cake to-go. Our waitress told us that the cook(s) had already left, so she would ask the guy doing the dishes if he could get that for us. I guess that goes to show how not-so-popular this place is.

Overall, our dining experience was okay - nothing special.",37,C,Trattoria168,Trattoria168,Tr@ttori@168,3.0,NEGATIVE

"This Pizza Hut is the bane of my existence.  This is ""my store"" for delivery and I now drive to other Pizza Hut locations of that's what I'm in the mood for.  

The last 4 times I've ordered my delivery has been late.  I usually do online or order through the app, which goes smoothly.  I get confirmation which is usually 30-40 minutes, which is acceptable to me.  However it usually takes 90 minutes to get it to me and I'm only 2 miles away from the store.  The worst was 2.5 hours, but there was a a Lightning game going on I believe.  Each time it was late, the pizza was cold, obviously.  

Other times I've gotten notice that delivery was going to take a long time, I've gone to pick it up. The store is always in disarray.  It's dirty and old looking, on need of a remodel fit sure.  For a while I think they only had one delivery driver. And I've only seen on girl in there at the counter that was friendly and happy to help.  Everyone else working there seems to hate their jobs.

Story begins with the owner John Kruks that was a  baseball player for the San Diego Padres, Philadelphia Phillies during 1980s 90s. He wanted to start out an authentic Philly Cheesesteak Shop and was able to do so in 2015 in Florida.

As I came in and looked at the menu, I notice they sell different types of cheesesteak, not just the one were accustom to. So i went ahead and tried there Pepper Cheesesteak. Simply delicious! Very delighted with the taste. Authentic indeed.

My only setback on the place is thier combo. They should put more fries with thier combo. A little more generous on that. But other than that, the place is nice and decent.

"Renny's Oki Doki food trucks came to our offices a couple of times with that ""Okinawan Feel Good Food"" and a review for them is overdue because people need to know that this food truck is one of the best food trucks out there and a solid go-to option for those craving unique Okinawan food. My favorite dish of theirs is the Seoul Food Bowl with Marinated chicken, stir fried with onions and Korean red pepper paste, over cabbage salad and jasmine rice, topped with our creamy  ""habu sauce"" and kimchi salsa and it was absolutely delicious. I have also had their Teriyaki Chicken Rice Bowl with Teriyaki marinated chicken stir fried with onions over crisp cabbage and carrots and jasmine rice, garnished with scallions and red ginger and it was pretty tasty as well.  I have not tried their Katsu Chicken featuring Crispy chicken cutlet with sweet and tangy katsu sauce over seasoned jasmine rice, with Asian cabbage salad but look forward to it the next time they visit our offices. My coworker like their Ma-san Soba which is a Japanese Soup with Okinawan soba noodles in a rich pork broth, topped with braised pork belly, scallions, pickled ginger and ""togarashi"" which had a Japanese red pepper & sesame blend.  Renny's Oki Doki also serves a side of seaweed salad and egg rolls. You can make any entree a meal deal with an egg roll and drink for $10. My only gripe with this food truck is that they don't stock enough food and quickly run out of their most popular items and then all of their items. I went the other day at 1:30PM with a half hour left of their promised food delivery and they were already all out of food. I was forced to go to another vendor. Other times, I got out there a half hour after they started serving and they were already out of their Teriyaki Chicken Rice bowl. So if the Renny's Oki Doki food truck appears somewhere, make sure to get out and hit them up as early as possible so that you can get as many options as possible from their menu.  Staff was friendly and explained all the dishes.

They have Blue Bell ice cream to make milk shakes. If I weren't so full I would have given it a try. They hand spin them so I'm willing to bet they are delish!

Fries were good, no complaints and they gave plentiful for the amount. Driver was courteous and showed up a little after 5pm and I seriously have no complaints. The food was good and reading prior reviews, I am glad that I went with take out.

"I stopped in here for a quick lunch while I was serving jury duty at the nearby District Courthouse. I was sat very promptly, and my order was taken quickly.

If you order an entrée, even at lunch, it comes with a cup of soup and spring roll. Those dishes also came out quickly. The spring roll was small but decent, while the soup was just salty chicken broth with a scoop of rice thrown in.

My meal took quite some time to come out. I ordered the tofu and vegetable stir fry, and it was quite a disappointment. There were about five pieces of tofu, and the vegetables were overwhelmingly sliced carrots.  Had the sauce been good, that still would have been okay, but the sauce was almost flavorless, and embarrassingly watery. Plus, after such a long wait, the dish was not served hot.

It took quite some time to get checked out, so my quick lunch ended up being about 50 minutes. This is one of those places that I've been wanting to try for some time, but I will be in no rush to go back.",4,A,Si-Am Thai,Si-Am Thai,Siam Thai ,3.0,NEGATIVE

I couldn't believe everything that was offered on the happy hour menu and for an affordable price. That being said, we did order off the cocktail menu. I really loved the aviation cocktail, it was a perfect blend of refreshing without being too sweet. I also had it's all about time, wasn't a big fan but the colors are really pretty.

"If you find me anywhere, please return me to myself. Hectic and chaotic does not do justice to my last couple of weeks. Thank goodness I had promised to not misbehave. I have not stopped. Aurora (my car) can testify that she has not rested. Indecisive me. Fickle me. Restless me. Today I went into four eateries. I was very hangry.

The one who loves ribs wanted Chinese food today. He hinted and sighed and eventually just asked as I drove him to crew camp. Orient Express it was...

Had Agatha Christie ever visited here, she might have not written her novel at all. Had she used me as one of the characters... I would have wanted to be murdered first. My nose is rather high maintenance. The food looked interesting (my mother uses this adjective when she does not want to criticize my accessory choices, the ones she really disagrees on.) Let me make clear that I don't mind cafeteria style places. But I felt odor-slapped as soon as I walked in. I also feel very pressured when asked for my order immediately. Perhaps others feel catered to... or welcomed when that happens. Not me. So I was a tad nauseous over the smell (mind you, it was not a foul smell at all. It was the overwhelming combination of food choices mingling and marrying, overpowering and divorcing all at once.) 

Had I fallen in love with the bareness of the decorations... wait! What decorations? No, that did not help to distract me either. Have I mentioned how visually sensitive I can be? I love beautiful things. The Libra in me seeks beauty. Anywhere. Everywhere. 

I will refrain from reviewing the place in detail even when, until today (yes, no more), I called for deliveries and found the food okay. They serve abundantly. Huge plates to share... if you wanted to share okay food with family or guests. I have delivery-tried (which was like blind tasting until today): fried rice, white rice, egg rolls (quite oily tasting), bourbon chicken, orange chicken, egg drop soup, steamed dumplings, pepper steak and Lo Mein. Call and order with enough time so that your hangriness does not get the best of you.

I went today. I felt catfished like in the MTV show. Our relationship platonic and beautiful. Maybe not the best, but okay. Nice... and nice is often good.

As for our pizza we ordered ""The Big Pie"" which is basically their supreme with a variety of meats and veggies. Best part of the pie was the sauce. I love saucy pizzas and our pie had a lot of sauce. The sauce had a nice sweet flavor that you would get from fresh roasted tomatoes.

"My wife and I decided to go to BGR on a Friday night for our date night. We arrived around 6 PM. and found the restaurant buzzing with people, but it never felt too crowded. There was a steady stream of people at the restaurant. The décor was very unique with record covers from the 80s on the wall and chandeliers that my wife took pictures of right away. The menu was a tad bit overwhelming at first as there were lots of choices beyond the normal Hamburger and Cheeseburger. Selections ranged from your typical Hamburger to Tuna Burger to Cuban to Greek Burger. Choices for sides include the classic French Fries, to the popular Sweet Potato Fries and Onion Rings to the most surprising choice: Grilled Asparagus. We decided to stick to the classic Cheeseburger. We both added the secret secret Mojo sauce and as a side we decided to split an order of Onion Rings. I also was able to get a tasty imported Palm Beer from Belgium and they also feature Tamps' own Cigar City Brewery (a huge plus in the book of a beer connoisseur like myself). Since we were there for dinner we didn't have a chance to try it, but we saw a $7.99 lunch deal on the menu that looked great.

After ordering we were given a pager and the food took about ten minutes to come out as it's all cooked to order.

While waiting we made the acquaintance with the Coke Soda Fountain of the future. There were literally 100s of possible combinations to choose from.  Just to illustrate the large amount of options: My wife got a ""Cherry Vanilla Mr. Pibb"". Go figure :)

Once the pager went off we went to pick up our food and we were very pleasantly surprises at how well put together the burgers were. Usually ""gourmet burger"" are stuffed over the top with toppings that slide off the bun onto your plate and put a huge downer on the entire experience. However, at BGR they hit all the fundamentals on the head and took them to the next level: a tasty firm bun, fresh crispy produce, and of course a perfectly cooked juicy burger. As far as the onion rings go, there were plenty to share for 2-3 people and they were delicious like they had just been made and. 
 
The best part of the experience at BGR was that my wife loved it. She is not usually a burger person, but she absolutely loved the Cheeseburger and Onion Rings she had.

"First time ordering from TPC and ordered online via UberEats. Went with a large pepperoni pie. Food arrived with no issue, still warm. Pizza was pretty tasty, no complaint there.

One recommendation.... since everything is to-go or delivery, I would recommend maybe using a sticker to help seal the pizza box, to avoid the food from being tampered with. Other restaurants staple the orders (bag) or seal them with tape. If the seal is broken, the food was tampered with. 

I would have never known if the Uber driver tampered with my food.

"5 guys burgers are awesome.  Anyone that compares their burger to fast food fare are WRONG!  These are not pre-packaged warmer bin burger or ultra spiced double dipped candy coated comes with a toy crap.  They make their burgers fresh with never frozen beef when you order, and are served just how you want them.  They have fresh jalapeno peppers, grilled mushrooms and onions, hot sauce, and all the regular fresh toppings you might want.  They are absolutely the best hands down.

Now on to the fries... some folks say they are worth a pass, but you have to understand why.  These are not crappy little shoestring fries that came out of a frozen bag like at fast food joints that we have been programmed to believe are good.  These fries are never frozen, are cut with the skin on for added flavor, and taste natural not manufactured.  A word of advice, if you are going solo order a small and if you are with someone just order one large fry.  Last time we got a large they filled the cup up, and then filled 1/4 of the large paper sack with them too.  The portions are ridiculous, but is that a bad thing??

"Came here on a girls night with my mini last night.  We booked a reservation online as I wasn't too sure how they were operating w/seating given COVID.  When we arrived, the parking lot was dead which made me sort of question if they were open.  Upon entering, we felt hot air hit us in the face and we were like wow, what the heck.  As we entered more into the place and approached the staff to get seated we were advised that their A/C was having issues but they had fans circulating in some of the areas.  We still chose to dine in as the area where we sat was not unbearable.  The waiter was very nice and quick --- probably one of the best services we ever received while dining here.  He took our drink order and brought over bread very quickly; took our meal order and had that out in no time.  I did feel bad for the staff given the A/C issues and how hot it was in there.  I'm typically one to freeze in restaurants so I was comfortable but my mini gets hot so easily and did complain a bit.  She couldn't wait to get to the car to have the A/C blow on her and cool her down.  We actually stopped into Target since it's located w/in the same plaza to take a walk around a cool place and hang out some more since we sort of dined and dashed (after paying of course) due to the heat.",1,A,Romano's Macaroni Grill,Romano's Macaroni Grill,Romano's Macaroni Grill,4.0,NEGATIVE

"Camille's is located on the first floor of a medical building, so I expected ""hospital food"", perhaps burgers and dogs.  What I found as I entered was much different.

The first thing that impressed me was the large menu of imaginatively formulated entrees; Wraps, Sandwiches and Flatbreads.  The next thing was the use of fresh ingredients, and healthy ones at that.

I chose the Thai Wrap and they included chips and salsa with it.  At first, I thought the combination was odd, but it turned out to be pretty good.  The chips were the multi colored type and the salsa was way way better than the Mexican restaurants in the area serve.  The Thai Wrap was excellent.  I really enjoyed it.

Service was fine at 2PM when I was there, but I can believe it might be slow during a lunch rush, as my Wrap was hand assembled for me.  The $6.99 price was better than Panera, considering how huge size of my Wrap plus the generous serving of chips.  Most of the entrees are about 7 bucks.

"The Basics: Sekushi is located in the outdoor section of International Plaza. Sekushi has many dishes to choose from, but mostly focuses on sushi rolls and ramen. There is outdoor and indoor seating at this restaurant. 

Things I like: I enjoyed all of the sushi rolls I ordered here. I particularly enjoyed the Crispy Rice appetizer and the Aria O roll. I also had the Tuna, Salmon, Yellowtail, and Otoro nigiri and they were very good as well. There are many creative rolls to choose from and this is a good spot to stop if you are at the mall and would like some sushi. 

Things I didn't like: The service here was a little bit spotty. I am not sure if this is because they are a new restaurant and are still working on things, but service was slow and we had trouble determining who our waiter was since many people were serving us throughout our meal. We also tried ordering one of their sakes and they only had one sake available when they had multiple on the actual menu. 

Overall, I enjoyed my meal at Sekushi. I thought the rolls were creative and the sushi was good quality. I was not blown away by the restaurant and would not necessarily go out of my way to come here, but if I am at the mall and would like a sushi meal, this is a great place to stop!

"Hidden in the shadow of its 24 hour big Sister, La Teresita, the Tex Mex location is unassuming and very easy to miss even with all of its lights and signs.  Fortunately, we had heard about it from a friend and were able to stop in and try out their food.  Their hours are not very clear, and apparently they do change depending on how busy the place is.  So they were about to close up shop when we came in but still served us and made it clear that we could take as long as we wanted.  

I had the opportunity to speak with the manager when I went and found out that they do plan on having the place stay open later when business starts picking up.  They also plan on building an outdoor deck on the side as well as obtaining a full liquor license so that it becomes a great place to go to later in the evening when you want something quicker and cheaper than at La Teresita proper.  

We came for the variety of vegetarian options we had heard that they carry.  Typically they carry tofu steak strips, regular marinated tofu cubes, a cheese stuffed poblano mixture, and butternut squash as options for their burritos, tacos, tostadas and what have you.  Unfortunately since we got there later, they were out of everything except the tofu and squash.  My wife got the tofu burrito and I got the butternut squash so we could try them out.  Both were huge and delicious, and very reminiscent of Taco Bus' vegetarian fare.  It also didn't hurt that between the two of us the bill was only $13 and we had plenty of leftovers to take home.  This also included unlimited chips and salsa while we waited for our food (which only took about 5 minutes to come out, by the way).

We were too full to try anything from their wall of dessert options, but they all look very tasty.  Vegetarian fans of both Taco Bus and Taqueria Monterrey should definitely stop by and try this place out.  If La Teresita's Tex Mex and Bakery can manage to stir up enough business and complete the upgrades the manager was discussing, I can see this becoming a great hangout and even better late night stop.",25,B,La Teresita Tex Mex and Bakery,La Teresita Tex Mex and Bakery,La Teresita Tex Mex and Bakery Inc.,4.0,POSITIVE

The restaurant was very clean and the staff attentive. 

When we arrived there was no wait and we were seated quickly. The menu is varied and there are some great selections at great prices! Our waiter recommended three things from the menu to include the steak and eggs sandwich, the strawberry stuffed French toast, and the country skillet. 

I was in the mood for savory so I went with the waiters recommendation and ordered the country skillet. I have to say out of five stars I'd rate it a 4/5. The only thing I'd improve on is a a little more gravy on the dish. Other than that it was delicious! The biscuit was so soft and fluffy! The eggs were fluffy and delicious! The potatoes were perfectly fried and tender. My only issue was there was TONS of onions but that's on me for not catching there was onions in the dish. I'd have ordered light on the onions or no onions at all. However, if you're in a savory mood I'd say go for it! 

My friend ordered the strawberry stuffed French toast special for 12.95! And she let me have a bite and it was soooo delicious! Honestly if I could have ordered like a side of that it would have perfectly complemented my savory dish. The playing was delicious and so beautiful! 

We did order the hot chocolate and while it was good, it wasn't the best hot chocolate I've ordered from a breakfast/brunch restaurant the whip cream was ok, but next time I think I'd skip on it. Though it is good to note, there are free refills on it AND you can get them to go.

The bar area was really pretty and had TVs for sports, and the restaurant was spacious. They also have a drive through-not sure if they use it though.

The food was good. The pizza crust was sort of buttery and thin (just the way I like it) and the house salad was really yummy. I gave it 4/5 stars because they didn't beat Marsala's or Anthony's (in my book).   $23 for the pizza and salad, plus tip.

"First time, Saturday night. The place is beautiful, atmosphere gets a 5. Wine was good, offer 3 sizes, though I thought the amounts were a little small. They have IPads to order but our server informed us that we could let him take our order so we get the appetizers out first then order dinner, which we did, (so that might help some problems with previous reviews) use the iPad to see the food. The food looked just like the pictures. 
     Appetizers were chickpea fingers and fried calamari, both were great. Calamari included small shrimp and peppers, yum. Dinners were 1)  red snapper, a little over cooked and needed a sauce, was supposed to come with spinach, got mashed potatoes instead which was very good, and the waiter apologized and brought out a side of creamed spinach too, which too was great. 2) chicken Marsala, it was good. 3) meatloaf, size was good but did not like the tomato sauce on it. 4) Moroccan chicken,  was very over cooked, chicken hard and dry, could hardly cut it, jerky like. Big disappointment. All sides were snow peas which were ok. 
   They offer a free club membership, you get a free appetizer on first visit and Saturday night was double points, earn points $1 per point, and at 200 points get $20 off. (I love frequent buyer cards) .

"I was very disappointed with my experience at Chipotle today. The line was almost out the door, which is typical at lunch time. After waiting for 15 minutes, I ordered a Barbacoa salad. The salad guy put about 1/2 as much meat on my salad as he did on the other 3 meals after mine. I asked the girl who was topping off the salad, to add more meat and she barely obliged. I then asked here to go ahead and make it double meat, since it is so hard to complete the order as requested. Then upon reaching checkout, the card reader was down (not their fault, I get it). It took the young lady about 3-4minutes to hand write my card number on a ticket. Finally I can go sit down and eat. Wrong answer, there were no forks available. It took almost 5 minutes for someone to bring out a container of forks. At this point, my prepared foot sat for almost 10 minutes.

On a good note, the food tasted great which is why I gave two stars instead of one.

I think they would have done better to reach out to the people in line and tell them up front that the card reader was not working and that there was a slight delay in the order process for credit and debit transactions. I also noticed that across various Chipotle stores that there is a lot of disparity in the amount of meat served on dishes. I know it isn't a perfect science but tighten up on the controls a little and make it more consistent please.

"Enjoi Sweets is one of my favorite food trucks. I love the design of it and of course their delicious cupcakes. They have catered a few events I have been to and I have to say they serve one of the best cupcakes I have ever had. They also will occasionally make Italian sodas that are delicious as well - I enjoyed one on the HOTTEST day of my life: The World's Largest Food Truck Rally EVER I at the Florida State Fairgrounds last August.

They tend to travel all over town and are team players in the food truck world, which is nice because small businesses really need each others support. They'll post photos of them helping out a fellow trucker whose tire is out and the other truckers do the same. Local restaurants should take some notes from how food truckers treat each other.

Prices are also affordable for a food truck and also for serving a dessert. If people have preferences they can call orders ahead, and sometimes when hanging out at a food truck rally I will literally see someone take a box filled with cupcakes...the so called ""cupcake fiends"" haha.

One thing I really like about this truck is how nice the owners are. Sometimes I block up their window because we are just chatting away haha.

"Pretty good. Kind of a hybrid of five guys, umami burger, and in and out. Too bad a combination of all of the above isn't better than the individual. I got a brisket burger and it wasn't that good. The beef was def better and stronger tasting, but it was almost too beefy. There wasn't enough anything else. Not enough bun, sauce, lettuce, etc. I don't like the burger to stick out a centimeter beyond the bun. They really need to put a hearty piece of lettuce and tomato on there! And a good amount of sauce. Come on now. If we want sauce then do it! I like their fries. But I'll be going back to the regular double cheeseburger from now on. 

I'm not sure what their true identity is. Overall I like it alright bc I like burgers but for some reason it's missing, what the French call, a certain ""I don't know what."" Fix the burger to bun ratio on the brisket and increase the amount of toppings and that will help. 

Btw, I called in and ordered a to go order. When i arrived 20 min later, there was a decent size line and I go straight up to an open register and say I'm here for my food. She told me I have to get in the line bc that girl was the one who took my order over the phone. And I'm like I'm not waiting in line for 10 min when my food is ready now! And she said no we will give you your food now but you have to wait in line to pay. Whaaaaaat??  I just got in the front of the line bc no freaking way am I waiting in line for my food to get cold.

"Note that this Quiznos is one of several vendors at the same location at Terminal A in the Tampa Airport, run by the same company HMSHOST. Shown below is partial text from an email that I sent to Tim Juul on February 9, 2014. According to the receipt I got, he is the manager of these combined operations. Sorry for all the detail, but this guy needs to know how bad things are.

Dear Mr. Juul:
 
I have to complain to you about your foodservice operations at Tampa International Airport's Terminal A. I fly to Tampa from Denver just about every month, and have come to dread my breakfast options on these morning return flights, because your company is my main set of options there.
 
Today's case is a perfect example of why I dread it.  Today, as you can see from the attached receipt, I ordered a bacon-egg-cheese biscuit, a fruit cup, and a 14-ounce container of chocolate milk. Nearly every aspect of the transaction could have been improved from your company's side.
 
First off, the prices charged for the product delivered can only be considered gouging. It is ridiculous to charge figures some 50% or more than those charged at high-margin convenience stores in the area. Stating that the rent is more or there are security considerations are not valid excuses. Other airports charge reasonable figures at their food service operations.
 
Also, the layout of the operation at Terminal A requires me to walk through the line at Quiznos, where they were taking orders for breakfast sandwiches. I initially ordered one of these, waited nearly five minutes for it, and then as I continued along the queue, realized that Pizza Hut was selling substantially the same product for much less. What I ended up buying cost some 30 - 40% less than the sandwich I initially ordered from Quiznos. Since there is only one queue, though, the customer is given the impression that the breakfast options at Quiznos are the only ones available. If the customer could easily go to the Pizza Hut counter easily, that would be a great improvement.
 
Next, I had to return the fruit cup I initially ordered as it clearly had been poorly prepared and was not suitable for consumption. If you think your customer should spend over $4 for perhaps 8 ounces of ""fresh"" fruit, this customer thinks it should be properly prepared and fresh. To me, this means the stems from the grapes are completely removed, and that all the fruit is neither over-ripened, nor not ripe enough to eat. The first cup I got had stems on the grapes, and the strawberry looked mushy. The replacement cup had under-ripened honeydew, and one piece I had to spit out as it was not suitable for consumption.
 
While I was getting the fruit cup replaced, your cleaning staff removed the chocolate milk from my table, apparently thinking that I was finished. Oh well.
 
The service of the operation also leaves much to be desired. On the mornings of these flights, I typically do not have coffee, so that I can sleep during my flight. Even though the time I get up is around 4:30 in the morning for my time zone, I appear to be far energetic and friendly than the staff serving me. One key exception was the gentleman taking my order at Quiznos. He was friendly enough. However, the man delivering the sandwich and the cashier could learn to smile and say things like thank you. Instead, they appear to simply go through the motions.
 
In conclusion, charging reasonable rates, serving better-prepared food, and some training for your staff in customer service relations would go a long way. Because these types of thing happen every time I try to use your company's services at Terminal A, I typically never order anything from you. This morning, I tried again, and you failed again. Your sales to this customer would quadruple or more if you made these small changes.",35,C,Quiznos,Quiznos,quiznos,1.0,NEGATIVE

Loaded with lots of fresh veggies that were perfectly cooked al dente. I really enjoyed these. A hearty serving of salmon was offered. IMO it needed more coconut milk and fresh ginger.   We loved the Ginger Beef. Spot on with the seasonings. Will order this again. I was also able to pick up some locally made kimchi, which had a nice kick to it. I'll certainly pick this up again.

Chicago Oyster seems all cheese, was okay. Boiled shrimp were bit over cooked, rubbery in texture both large and regular size. Fried Shrimp were excellent!! Red fish was mild in flavor well made, they got this right! 

But the most disappointment were the boiled crab..yes they were boiled but it lacked flavor..Toni D wrote on an earlier critic "" Old Bay"" Yes, they need to listen to this critic, this person is right!

I had fries with buffalo wings, blue cheese crumbles/sauce, bacon bits and jalapenos. My issue was the boneless chicken wings/nuggets. They were very, very obviously of the frozen variety and by the time I got a few bites into my dish the thick overly bready breading had soaked up way too much sauce, resulting in a very unappetizing sogginess.

Now I don't claim to be a authority on Indian food, but I have to say this is one of the best meals I have ever eaten. I asked the waiter what his favorite meal was he told me that it was the goat masala. So, I told him I would try it. And I must say, I was not disappointed. The meat was tender and melt in your mouth delicious, the naan bread was also exquisite light and fluffy in places and crispy where it needs to be, it was fresh baked in a clay oven. The basmati rice was also delicious. I cannot rate this place high enough for anyone who enjoys Indian food. Is an absolute 10 out of 10, and I intend to drag everyone I know to this restaurant.",0,A,Tabla Fine Indian Cuisine,Tabla Fine Indian Cuisine,Tabla Fine Indian Cuisine,5.0,POSITIVE

"This may be my #1 place in South Tampa.  
The quality of every ingredient and the preparation are always perfect.  You'll never get a bad cut of meat or anything but the freshest greens.  I like the other Ciccio places but this one is a step above IMO.  Makes other food taste bland by comparison.  Also feels healthier than some other alternatives.  

Try a bowl if it's your first order but you really can't go wrong - I indulged (for the first time) in some fries with my last order and true to form they were perfectly crispy and delicious.  They don't do anything here they can't do to perfection.

Didn't expect a lot from this cruise and dine but was surprised a little. Did the Tampa cruise as opposed to the Clearwater cruise. $89 per person for the Free Bar at Sea which included dinner and free house alcohol. Also paid $25 for a window seat. Enjoyed the views. The waitress (Bri or Bree was her name I believe) we had needs to find a new job. She was not attentive and slow and forgetful. She was slow to bring drinks and when I asked her to bring me straight liquor with no ice she said that was not allowed. So I can only assume that the drinks were watered down.

"Went here on a Saturday morning.    Noticed that the place was packed when we walked in.   It's seat yourself.    We looked around and found two empty tables inside (they also having seating outside).    We walked up to one that was just cleaned off by the waiter.   He didn't say anything as we proceeded to pull out the chairs to sit down.    I noticed that a magazine and sunglasses were sitting on the table so I motioned for the waiter to come over to ask him if someone left these items.    That's when he tells us that the table is taken already.  OK!...why didn't he say anything when he saw us going to sit down.    We were lucky enough that there was the other table still empty but needing to be cleaned off.   We moved to the other table and waited for an employee to clean off the table.    A girl came over,  cleared the plates...etc, and wiped off the table with a wet rag.   The crumbs were pushed onto the carpeted floor.   That's when I really noticed the floor.   Disgusting!!! ...crumbs, wrappers...just dirty.   Someone needed to take a carpet-sweeper and do a little cleaning every now and then.     The Pink Flamingo is one of those places where you don't want to look around too much.  Because if you do, you will notice how dirty the place is..   They have stuffed animals hanging from the ceiling that are covered with dust.   

We mentioned to the waiter that we only had limited time (thinking maybe he would try to keep that in mind with getting our drinks and getting our order into the kitchen).    We both ordered the same thing...    10. SHORT STACK AND EGGS .
A stack of two buttermilk pancakes, served with two eggs
prepared any style, with your choice of bacon, ham or sausage. 

We waited so long to get the food that it was ridiculous.   How long does it take for 2 pancakes, 2 eggs, and a side of meat!??    Figures, the one time that we were in somewhat of a rush, it took forever to get the food.

The food was good!    Though the service was lacking a bit.   He refilled our coffee once but never came back to ask if we needed anything else (would have liked more butter).

Overall, it's a decent, local breakfast place.  However they should think about doing a little make-over.",32,C,Pink Flamingo Cafe,Pink Flamingo Cafe,Pink Flamingo Caf3,3.0,NEGATIVE

Monday's, Tuesday's and Saturdays feature their Signature Unlimited Catfish option until 5PM. Came in here thinking I was going to order Brisket and ended up going with this option. 

Note: unlike many BBQ places they actually have brisket and BEEF ribs. This might seem like a ""Capt'n Obvious"" statement but many don't have brisket and many more give you pork ribs, not need ribs. Major difference in taste, if you ask me.

I don't know if the fries are hand cut but they are the thick kind. I can vouch for the potato salad here - I'd give it a 7 out of 10.

"Lan's Deli is an office building cafe in Westshore (end of Cypress) that serves cheap and tasty sandwiches and such. I'm not saying this is 5 star cuisine but when compared to other office cafes, Lan's stands out to me. 

Let's start with Lan herself, a very nice lady who will remember your name and considering this cafe is a one-woman operation, she is really efficient. I normally don't have to wait more than 7 minutes to get my food after ordering. This is important because I only take 30 minutes for lunch. So I give her 5 stars for service.

The food is better than your standard sandwiches from office cafes. She uses a few different types of breads and croissants. For instance, she uses pumpernickel bread on some sandwiches. Didn't know if I would like that with my Beefeater sandwich but it is actually very good. She also puts a little twist on her chicken salad sandwich and whatever else she makes. As Lan is Vietnamese, she also makes a couple Vietnamese items on certain days - summer rolls with peanut sauce on Tuesdays and pho on Wednesdays (which might be her busiest day). What other office cafe has that? I'm trying to get her to make banh mi. She doesn't think there would be a demand for it but if you go, ask her for it and maybe if enough people do, she will add it. 

Another reason for 5 stars is the price. I stopped visiting another office cafe because they raised their prices to almost $9 a sandwich. At Lan's, all of her sandwiches are in the $5-7 range and they taste better! On top of that, the atmosphere is nice. It's in the middle of an atrium with 40 foot ceilings that has trees and lots of natural lighting from the glass ceiling. Very relaxing, especially since this office building doesn't have many workers. So 5 stars for Lan's!",25,B,Lan's Deli,Lan's Deli,Lan's D3li,5.0,POSITIVE

"After driving by this construction site for about a year, Ford's Garage is finally open as of Tuesday, August 15th.

Welcome to Westchase/Citrus Park.

My friends and I have enjoyed every previous visit to other locations in Estero, Brandon and Wesley Chapel/Lutz, and my first to this new location delivered everything that I enjoy about the brand.

As I've said in previous reviews of those locations, Ford's Garage is one of the most attentive to detail themed bar and restaurants. It almost feels like something you would visit inside a major theme park. They don't miss a thing...and even if you don't necessarily have to use the restroom during your visit, make sure you go check that out too.

There weren't any negative surprises about walking in the newest location. It was great to see Rhiannon's familiar face behind the bar as she has been taking great care of customers like me at another bar/restaurant brand for almost a decade. Her and Tina gave me excellent service and just show how this Ford's has hired some really quality people.

Our food was excellent. My friend loves their Chicken Cobb Salad and couldn't wait to attack it. I always put together a ""Custom Built"" burger and it was prepared accurate and tasty. The pickle chips and baked beans were also delicious.

There's very little on the menu I wouldn't order, so the fact that this location is about 15 minutes from home will give me the opportunity to explore more things.

For those of you who enjoy beer, Ford's has pretty much anything you wish. Vast selection of drafts and huge coolers full of other brands in bottles and cans. If you prefer spirits, their $4 specials on select name brands should get your attention as well.

Thanks for being worth the wait.",33,C,Ford's Garage,Ford's Garage,Ford's Garag3,5.0,POSITIVE

Some people think the juices are a bit pricey yet if you truly understand this industry and why you drink this stuff you'll understand that you get way more nutrients per calorie than in any other food. So a little goes a long way because you won't be craving junk an hour later. And when you eat organic, the price equals the value.

The sushi wasn't terrible but I wouldn't return as I have my regular sushi restaurants where no other restaurant can beat. 

Reasons for the 3 stars:

Price: Not worth it. For 20$ I got a bento box and another sushi roll. For average sushi 20$ is way too high. The shrimp tempura roll wasn't warm and the rice either. Spicy tuna roll wasn't super tasty and they could improve on their spicy mayo.

"I really enjoyed this hotel. Grand Hyatt brought their ""A game"" and met all my needs. The hotel is massive with both standard rooms and villas that are near the water. The villa area with the nature walk feels more like a resort than a hotel. Unfortunately I didn't stay in a villa but fortunately my standard king room was nice and cold, clean, modern, and kept very clean by the housekeeping squad. Very beautiful views of the water depending on which type of room you select. Probably worth a couple extra bucks to get a water view because it's really pretty. The staff has a shuttle that takes people to the airport every 30 minutes and they'll even give you a lift to the onsite restaurant via golf cart if you don't feel like walking. The staff was helpful, informative, and friendly. Oh! I almost forgot, they gave me free water bottles everyday. When I checked out this morning I still had 4 unopened bottles in my room. They hook it up. Room service food definitely isn't good but I've grown to lower my expectations and anticipate receiving some less than stellar food. It wasn't terrible but it definitely wasn't memorable. Don't get room service and you should be pretty happy staying here.

"It was my first time at Ocean Prime and I must say I was impressed. We are in town for the weekend and wanted to enjoy a nice dinner. My mom also has a friend who lives in Tampa so he suggested to come here. We made reservations by calling ahead an hour before we wanted to come and we were booked. Easy pease to set reservations. The staff was very nice and we enjoyed our dinner. Our waiter was Danny and he was super cool as well. 

We all started with drinks. My mom and I had Moscato, my husband had Pinot Noir and my mom's friend had an Old Fashioned. The drinks were good!  No complaints.  They also brought bread to the table. Their bread was very good! I also really appreciated that the bread was served warmed. I love when the butter just melts on the bread. The bread basket came with two types of breads. It came with rolls and pretzel bread. My fav were the rolls.My husband and I also shared the Prime Roll Sushi. It was delicious and packed with flavor. 

After bread and drinks, some of us started with salads. My mom and I shared the Wedge Salad and my mom's friend had the Caesar. I really loved how this wedge salad's dressing was like a bleu cheese dressing vinaigrette. It was perfect. I normally don't like wedge salads as the dressing can be too much. This salad it was perfect. A good salad! 

Apparently, they are known for their steaks. While my husband and I wanted to try other items, we couldn't come without trying a steak. My mom had steak and lobster, her friend got steak with bleu cheese crust and my husband and I split steak and lobster with black truffle butter. We also shared sides like creamed spinach and mashed potatoes. I also got a baked potato. All of their food was perfect and cooked to the perfect temperature. They cooked the steaks perfectly! So tender and juicy. I also liked that they served warm butter with the lobster. I will say while the creamed spinach was good it was rich. 

Now it's time for dessert! We saw from Yelp and heard that the top two desserts are their 10 Layer Carrot Cake and their Warm Butter Cake, so we ordered both! Both were good but my favorite was the Carrot Cake. It was moist and layered with deliciousness. 

Overall, Ocean Prime offers some pretty good food! We left full and happy!",12,A,Ocean Prime,Ocean Prime,Ocean Prime Inc.,5.0,POSITIVE

Thank you for providing people with quality service and product. For being kind to us without knowing my kiddo was special needs. I walked in today, my order was ready and I spent maybe 2 min waiting. FYI- they have ready to go pastries in a fridge, drinks and some larger size desserts ready to go as well.

"I heard about Kebablicious while I scoping out the lunch menu that was going to be provided @ SPC' ""All College Day"" in Clearwater. I saw that they were serving ""Chicken Shewarma"". Now the first time I ever heard the word ""shewarma"" was on the 'Avengers' movie. So I decided to Google Kebablicious Chicken Shewarma. Once I saw the pics I was like ""..oh these are like gyro types.."" So I decided to put that on my list for lunch. Basically, at All College Day, everyone is provided with two tickets for the food truck of your choice. I decided to go with Kebablicious, of course, and another food truck. I was deciding on which one to eat for lunch and which one to eat for dinner, yes, I know you're thinking....anyway, so once a co-worker, and I both got the Chicken Shewarma from Kebablicious, we then went to stand in line at the other food truck. My co-worker devoured the Chicken Shewarma, while I was trying my best to discipline myself not to eat it because by then I decided that I was going to save it for dinner later. I eat a couple of the fires and OH MY GOODNESS  SO FRESH! So I got food from the other truck and it was not all that as I expected. It was more like ""..eh.."" So by the time I got home, of course the food was cold, but do you know that the fries were still good, and the Shewarma, yes..good!

"I had a day off and stopped by this place on a whim.  Just wanted some sushi. My favorite place doesn't  open until 3pm.  I'm always open to try new restaurants in the neighborhood.  I ordered the sashimi lunch special, the pork belly bun appetizer and a Sapporo beer.   The  beer never came.  I had to ask for it when my appetizer came.  The pork belly appetizer was disappointing.  The bun had a very thin slice of pork that was chewy and hard.  When i bit into it,  I didn't taste any pork.  Very sad.  Now I have to go home make my own pork belly bun to overcome the negative memory.  My principle is if I ate some bad but it should good.  I go and find the same thing somewhere that is made good and eat it again to replace the bad memory.  One good thing is the sashimi combo.  The fish was fresh and the cut was thick.  Though she forgot to bring me soy sauce and the rice that came with it.  My take on this new place is it's okay.  The service need lots of improvements.  The food is mixed.

My son is also Autistic with fairly limited interests, and video games and Pokemon rate the highest and strongest in those interests. Today's video games are just out of my league with their 4 toggles, 8 buttons, 2 triggers and 2 paddles per controller.  So I was excited to be able to show my son some games from ""my time"" and connect with him thru an activity that he would enjoy. And boy, this place did not disappoint!

So even tho this is a bar, minors are allowed until 11 p.m. They have specials every night of the week, and Monday is free game play night. So we chose to check it out on a Monday. While they do say it's only a limited amount of machines set to free play, there wasn't very many free games. Only one pinball machine was set to free and a few arcade games. But, their prices are really great honestly. We played for 2 hours on $15, and we only played a couple free games. 

I'm not a fan of beer, but I really enjoyed their pear cider. My son got their rootbeer on tap, and said he really liked it. He got a kick out of sitting at the bar with me, drinking ""beers"" and playing Supersmash Brothers together.

I psyched myself up for their airfries which turned out to be nothing special and came with a bunch of mildly flavoured ketchups which they sadly really need. 

Even though this one is in a mall you can't get your food on a tray. They need to work that out with the mall asap.

You can get, ribs, ribs combo, pulled pork, brisket combo, 1/2 chicken. 

Why can I not just get brisket or sausage , what if I don't want chicken at all? The Mac n Cheese is given in a small scoop in a small bowl instead of a hearty serving of the ole ooey guey stuff.

He asked for the ""diablo"" sauce for added spice but it was a tad too spicy for  him, so he might see if they could do half diablo/half standard marinara next time. It came with an italian wedding soup that he thought it was delicious. I ordered the Chicken Marsala and it was fine, but not great. The chicken was a little dry, perhaps a little overcooked? And the ceasar that came with it was again fine, but not the best ceasar I've had. The portion sizes were all ginormous so we had a ton of left overs.

"Darn good food, for the price.

I used to live just a few miles from this place, and it was a regular weekly haunt for me & my husband.  Almost like a ""poor man's Crazy Buffet"".  If you like sushi, you'll find this place to be an even better value.  They have a suprising assortment of decent (not great) sushi.  Though I'd definitely reccomend you come during the beginning of the lunch or dinner rush.  Come during off-peak times and the sushi is a little too warm, and rubbery.  Not good.  But come when it's fresh and it's just right.  

Of the regular Chinese food, they have a darn good assortment, pretty much anything you could ask for, including a regularly changing variety of Dim Sum.  My favorite was the little shrimp pastries, whatever they were called.  They were good.  They also had Miso Soup, which isn't standard fare for most Chinese places, and was a nice suprise.  

Nights, they had crab legs on the buffet and like so many Chinese crab leg buffets, they were often a bit over-cooked and difficult to get the meat out of them.  But occasionally we caught them on a good night and had our fill of some pretty good crab legs.  Just don't go with your hopes too high, if you're hoping for the crab.  

The sweet tea is excellent and the service was always very good.  Now my husband and I visit Tampa a couple times a year and this is one place that's on our ""must visit"" list.  Only drawback, us being truck drivers, is that it's not truck-friendly, unless you drop your trailer and bobtail.

"I know the menu just changed to Mexican today so I am way ahead of the game here and perhaps that's unfair, but OE Market SHOULD NOT serve Mexican food.

There was a ton of hype leading up to the Market Goes Mexican release and yes, I was excited. But when you really think about it, the Mexican vibe does not go with Oxford Exchange. They were blaring Latin music and have added all sorts of pinatas and Our Lady of Guadalupe candles around the place to make it all Mexican.

You can choose your protein, choose your vehicle (aka tortilla or whatever else you want) and then choose three toppings. They do not ask you if you want it for there or to go, so I'm just assuming they make everything to go.

I ordered the spicy pork belly taco with ancho sauce, pico de gallo and blistered shishito peppers. I waited for a little bit to get my taco but it was sort of busy so I didn't really mind. There is basically no space to sit in the place and the guys in front of me had taken up the ENTIRE row so I had to eat outside. No big deal. 

When I got the taco, I was actually really disappointed. You'll see the picture and notice there is basically no pico de gallo on the taco at all. The pork belly wasn't even spicy and was mediocre at best. It had no flavor. The pepper? Meh. The ancho sauce was all over the place and although it tasted good, it was basically the only thing on the taco that I liked.

This is not OE's specialty whatsoever. The food at their regular restaurant is actually pretty good and I quite liked the sandwich aspect of the market because it truly felt like a market. Their juices are actually pretty good -- their almond milk is a good blend and is made fresh. 

The market also has some refrigerated items to take home which looked pretty appetizing. 

But on the whole, this new menu change is a recipe for disaster. OE will get people going there with the hype, but they won't keep them because these tacos are not good. Head to Green Lemon on South Howard for better quality tacos packed full of flavor. Or go to Miguel's. Or anywhere else.

The bread is wrong, the steak tastes like ground beef.  At least they got the cheese wiz right, I guess.  In their defense, I have rarely found a decent cheesesteak outside of Philly (Jersey Mike's is not authentic, but is tasty).  I had to throw it away.  Disappointed in the Krukster.

The sweet and spicy wings were seriously tasty, but needed a little more heat to even be considered ""mild"".  The burgers were just ok... in need of a little seasoning, which is an amateur mistake if you ask me.  The parmesan garlic fries were amazing!  Very garlic-y and cheesey.

"If you like working Air Conditioning, quiet/clean rooms and quality customer service I suggest you run away from this hotel as fast as you possibly can. Let me start off by saying I'm really not picky when it comes to hotels. Give me a somewhere to park, nice cold AC and a bed to sleep on that isn't rock hard and I'm good to go. Upon arrival I parked in a garage for free and got in my room with a comfortable king size bed; good start but it was pretty much all downhill from there. My girlfriend and I left the room pretty much immediately to go out for dinner and drinks. Before we left I noticed the room was a bit warm so I cranked the AC down so it would be cold when we got back... something I do pretty much every time I get into a hotel room. When we got back I passed out almost immediately from the combination of a long day/drive and a few drinks. The real nightmare began at 5:30am when I woke up sweating. Even though the thermostat was set to 70 the room temperature was 80 degrees! I would have asked for a new room immediately but my girlfriend was still sleeping so I tried to lay on top of the bedding and relax. As I'm laying there I hear a noise that was reminiscent of an air conditioning unit turning on, running for a bit, turning off and repeat. Only thing was the noise wasn't happening consistently, sometimes it was every 5 seconds others it would go away for 30 and come back. It was driving me CRAZY! After over an hour laying awake in bed, I take to the internet on my phone to start looking at reviews and see if there are others complaining about similar things. I came across a couple talking about how noisy the elevators were, sure enough I look outside my window and right next to my room is the elevator... half of the rooms are facing inside an atrium looking directly across to office buildings which is very odd but that didn't really bother me because as I said before I am typically very easy to please with hotel rooms. Once I figure out I'm not imagining things and it was the elevator making noise I go down and request to be changed rooms for the following day. Other than having to pack up our things and move up a floor getting changed rooms was a pretty painless process. Get in the new room and it is HOT, chalk it up to AC being up high and turn it down and we go out around Tampa for the day and early evening. Even though I turned the AC down to 65 we came back and the room is 79 degrees! I'm sorry but my house is 74 degrees and thats because I am paying for it I want my hotel room to be COLD, I'm not going to have 3 more poor nights sleep.... time to change hotels. I explained my situation to the front desk and they told me that they can't help me with any sort of refund because it was booked through a third party. Okay whatever I understand and get Orbitz on the phone, waited 30 minutes and eventually went down to the front desk again where myself, Orbitz and Intercontinental Tampa manager discussed the cancellation and refund. All parties agreed I would only be charged for the first night. Only thing is the hotel needed to receive a fax confirming this from Orbitz. I waited on the line for 20 minutes by the front desk then asked the manager if we would still be okay for the refund if she didn't receive the fax (can I hang up the phone) as I wanted to start packing. The manager said yes which is actually frustrating because if she didn't need that fax that means she could have helped me without contacting Orbitz to begin with they just wanted to avoid a cancellation and refund. So I hang up the phone, pack the car in the garage, pull the car around and come in to get confirmation. The manager has received the fax and is refusing to give me a copy. The claim is that there is confidential information on the fax. I said thats fine, white or scribble over whatever is confidential and give me a copy and STILL REFUSES. She offers me a folio showing I had a zero balance with the hotel which does me absolutely nothing, I booked through Orbitz, I would have had a zero balance with the hotel even if I stayed there the full day. All I wanted was some sort of confirmation that the hotel and Orbitz agreed to refund the 3 days that I stayed, even if it was basic notes on the folio or something on company letter head. I only wanted this so I can provide it to my bank if I had to make a credit card dispute. The hotel refused this request for reasons beyond anything I can comprehend. 
Also as we were leaving my girlfriend notice a dry bloodspot on the sheets, Gross! If you look at the picture it was right at the top corner of the bed, I don't know how someone could miss this. 

So one last time, do not stay at this hotel. Literally worst experience I have ever had with any business, ever.

"The first thing I noticed walking in was the smell. It was so incredibly clean smelling and not your typical fishy or pungent odor most markets around here have. It still definitely has an oceanic scent inside but you can tell by the scent alone how fresh the seafood is. 

Howie is incredibly personable and gave me a generous portion of salmon jerky to try while I waited for my food... the smokiness was delicious and the fish was still tender and had a nice chew- it wasn't tough or shriveled. You can tell he's incredibly proud of the seafood he sources and it was all beautiful to look at. I would've bought jerky and the Spanish octopus had I not been on a lunch break. I also saw they had sea beans which I adore but can never find anywhere to purchase. 

Now I came to the store for poke off of coworkers recommendations and it really hit the spot for me. Big beautiful chunks of fresh salmon.. the quality speaks for itself. 

All in all a great addition to the neighborhood. When it comes to seafood you get what you pay for.. I haven't come across almost any local seafood markets in Tampa with fish this fresh. Great quality and value!",10,A,Heights Seafood,Heights Seafood,Heights Seafood Inc.,5.0,POSITIVE
"Picked this place because it was walking distance from our downtown hotel. Location is not the only thing this gastro pub has going for it- though it is primo-- right across from the popluar Riverwalk and park, museums and theaters up the street.

The pre-theater and late night menus tell you that they know their audience and cater to them. We stopped in well after 8 to avoid a crowd. It was perfect. We were seated immediately and dug into the menu. Think tapas - plates big and small, easy to share.  Highlights included a Hamachi tuna tartare as lip smacking as I've had in a while; seafood ramen was popular at our table, and their ""stinky buns"" were worth a sniff - pork belly was best (from their fomer food truck days). Charcuterie and noodle bowls (Jap Chae) were awesome. Perfect place to come with a crowd to share.

Comfortable and charming/chic but laid back vibe and decor make for a lovely ambiance.

"Farm to fork, visible kitchen, scratch made bakery and house made syrups and all juices are fresh. This is a MUST visit for deliciously prepared food and smooth wholesome cocktails.

On vacation and dying for some brunch. We arrived on a Saturday afternoon and were seated almost immediately. The tables are farmhouse style with industrial piping. The decor is whiskey inspired with adorable sayings and and overall barrel design. You can't help but watch the bar as they prepare the fresh fruit for syrups and cocktails, as they take impeccable care. 

Our server was Cubby and she is worth requesting. She took the time to explain the concept of whiskey cake and when we asked her about a delicious cocktail for myself and a mocktail style for my sister, she immediately had recommendations. I got the Little Rye Lies and my sister got the Pink drink. The pink drink is a mixture of pineapple, grapefruit and cranberry fresh juices and made her preggo self in juice heaven! I was in love about my cocktail, the mint and orange gave it a soft aroma with the rye whiskey. Cocktail was smooth and fantastic.
For brunch we got the banana caramel pancakes and chicken and waffles. Nothing tasted artificial or store bought. You can tell the pancakes and waffles had the right amount of savory that complimented their toppings. For the chicken and waffles, the gravy has a hint of spice that pairs deliciously with the smoked syrup and lightly breaded chicken. And pancake caramel is a brown butter mixture with some Cream without a bunch of sugar. The whip cream on top was creamy and most definitely made in house as well.

"My husband and I did a staycation at the Epicurean Hotel when it first opened. During this stay we were introduced to Élevage and Gavin, one of the bartenders. Over the years my husband and I have been back countless times for brunch, lunch and dinner.  We've celebrated birthdays, holidays and most recently our anniversary at Élevage. If Gavin is working we will typically sit at the bar or in the bar area.  We frequently ride our bikes up on Sunday's and take advantage of the bike racks by the valet. 

Whenever we've asked for suggestions for food or drinks, Gavin has never steered us wrong. My favorite drinks are the Mojito and Sangria (same recipe thar Bern's uses).  They have a fabulous wine selection and happy hour menu.  Gavin knows my taste in wine so well he will know whether I'll like what's on happy hour. They also have a great Scotch collection that my husband enjoys as well as their Old Fashioned.

Favorite brunch dish is the Shrimp and Grits. Although you can't go wrong with the Juicy Lucy burger either!  I love the Nola Shrimp app and how can you pass up the Homage to Bern's sandwich?!  If you like Brussel sprouts you have to try them at Élevage!  They have happy hour of everyday, with a handful of $6 appetizers, cocktails, wine and beer.  Try a risotto or bikini sandwich.

Under seasoned everything .. meat, beans, toppings. Bland!
Pico de gallo was extremely watery so when placed in my burrito bowl there was pool action going on. 
You guys, please let the pico de gallo drain a little through the spoon before you plop it onto someone's meal. Common sense. 
It was also the most flavorless pico de gallo I've ever had. Not enough salt , lime or cilantro . Just a watery waste of tomatoes.

Too much everything. Complete overkill. 
10lbs. of rice, 2lbs. ofbeans, 2lbs. of corn, 2lbs. of pico de gallo etc etc .. .. lettuce poking out of closed container...  You get the point.

For starters our table of 4 shared yucca fries and octopus medallions. The fries were great-crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside. Served with a tasty dipping sauce.  I wouldn't bother again with the medallions, though - not much flavor in the tiny shaved pieces even though its dipping sauces were good, too.

My entree, the Bouillabaisse, was incredible. Flavorful tomato-based soup broth, stuffed to the gills (hah!) with seafood. Crab legs were piled in the top of the bowl, and mussels, clams, shrimp, squid, and huge chunks of fish were swimming below. 

One would think I'd be stuffed after such a treat, and yet I still managed to find room for the salted caramel cake. Yum! Cake was moist, and the combo of salty/sweet was just right.

"KELP has been a longtime favorite of me and my best friends. I first dined at KELP three years ago upon the recommendation of my best friend, a South Tampa local who has been dining at KELP for several years. The dine in experience is absolutely delightful. While the interior is small, the space is well decorated, well air conditioned during hot Florida summers, and provides a comfortable experience for a small group of friends to grab lunch together. We sat at the bar and even got to watch out sushi burritos being made with fresh ingredients!

In current, COVID-filled times, KELP is offering outdoor seating in a wonderfully lit and socially distanced patio space. All food is take out, meaning there is no wait staff if you choose to sit outside -- so don't forget to order a drink at the register if you're wanting one! The staff is, as always, absolutely wonderful. Everyone is wearing a face mask and the outdoor register is wiped down after every single use. They even have a utensil holder for used pens to sort between the clean ones and the used ones. Sanitizer is also provided, and all guests are required to wear face masks unless eating on the patio.

No matter what you get at KELP, it's going to be delicious. My personal favorite are either the sushi burritos or the sushi combo, which allows you to get a small appetizer and two eight piece sushi rolls for $12 -- trust me when I say there's no better deal in South Tampa for the quality and quantity of yummy sushi KELP provides.

I love the minimalistic, rustic Italian-themed look of the place. Very clean in appearance. If there are spaces available, you can choose where to sit and will be presented with a menu right away at the table.  They usually run lunch specials during the days they are open.

The pad thai is good. You get a healthy portion so much it's hard to eat in one sitting. Unfortunately, heating up the leftovers is not as good. The rice noodles stick together and the flavor is lost. 

I want to give it another try - with panang beef and rice because I wanna believe it has to better. After all, they sold out, right?

"In my 20s this was the go to spot to drink and hang out with friends. Now that I'm an adult with a child, I've come to realize I like this place to eat as well.

This particular Ale House has been here for years I've just never really noticed it. Its dark inside because of all the dark wood but they have lots of light so you won't have a problem reading the menu.  There are tons of televisions so any sports game you're looking for they could probably accommodate. You walk in and there are tons of booths to sit and eat and if you have big parties you can go all the way to the end and find long tables to gather. There is a huge bar in the middle and its easy to walk around. It doesn't have that stick to your feet floor feeling that other sports bars have It's clean and inviting.

The hubs and I were at Michael's and ventured over for a late night meal. It was a Wine Down Wednesday (bottles were half off WHAT!!) and they had a whole lobster meal as the special. I can't remember the price so I won't quote it wrong. I'm a messy eater but they made sure to give me a bib, a tons of wet naps. it was a good meal at a good price. I wanted an item off the menu- just noodles (no I'm not pregnant) to go with the meal and they were able to create it for me. I was waiting for them to say it wasn't possible but our waitress went right back to the kitchen asked if it was ok to make and bam I got what i wanted. They have a sorts of specials- drinks/food/ etc. There is always some kind of gimmick going on and the service is always friendly and quick.

I guess the only downside to the restaurant, but not that if affects me, is that it is small (10-12 tables) and it can get pretty loud it the confined area...especially once a table is a few bottles of wine in (which there is no uncorking fee, btw).

"Why 5 stars? Because this is why I love Ybor City.

   ---   ---   ---

When people come to visit, I always send them to Ybor, because Ybor has something for everyone. Fine dining, casual dining, beer bars/breweries, dive bars, cocktail bars, clubs, ghost tours, etc etc. 

And now they have a (re-vamped) arcade!

I remember visiting the old Game Works, years ago, and it was fairly unmemorable. Actually, it was very unmemorable because I don't have a specific memory about it. 

But GameTime? I'll never forget it!

Buy yourself a blue card, which gives you one hour of play on a majority of the games. You'll be worn out by the time you're done, and it's only $15! A couple rounds of Pop-A-Shot are incredibly tiring, but I did my best to play as much of that as I could during my hour. I made it to the final round a couple of times, which was even more exhausting. I can say this with a completely straight face - GameTime can be a good replacement for the gym, when you spend a lot of time playing basketball.

But there are definitely plenty of other games as well: air hockey, duck bowling, Deal or No Deal, beer pong, the thing where you hit something with a giant hammer as hard as you can, the one big punch on a punching bag game, etc. I'm telling you - many of them require a decent amount of physical force/activity! Of course, there are plenty of standard arcade games as well, if you're not looking to break a sweat.

"The Basics: Sekushi is located in the outdoor section of International Plaza. Sekushi has many dishes to choose from, but mostly focuses on sushi rolls and ramen. There is outdoor and indoor seating at this restaurant. 

Things I like: I enjoyed all of the sushi rolls I ordered here. I particularly enjoyed the Crispy Rice appetizer and the Aria O roll. I also had the Tuna, Salmon, Yellowtail, and Otoro nigiri and they were very good as well. There are many creative rolls to choose from and this is a good spot to stop if you are at the mall and would like some sushi. 

Things I didn't like: The service here was a little bit spotty. I am not sure if this is because they are a new restaurant and are still working on things, but service was slow and we had trouble determining who our waiter was since many people were serving us throughout our meal. We also tried ordering one of their sakes and they only had one sake available when they had multiple on the actual menu. 

Overall, I enjoyed my meal at Sekushi. I thought the rolls were creative and the sushi was good quality. I was not blown away by the restaurant and would not necessarily go out of my way to come here, but if I am at the mall and would like a sushi meal, this is a great place to stop!

My coworker and I decided to try Dulce Café Bakery for lunch today and it was one of the most amazing lunches. We are already talking about what we are going to order next week!

I ordered a Carnitas Taco and a Roast Pork sandwich and my co-worker ordered the Sopes and a Steak Taco. Everything was amazing. The Carnitas Taco was the best taco I have had in Florida, if not the United States. This simple, but authentic taco was filled with pork, pickled red onions, lettuce, and habanero peppers and was served on a freshly made tortillas. A squeeze of lime and a touch of the salsa verde created a fiesta in my mouth! It was a bit of an overkill to order the roast pork sandwich once I realized the sandwich was so huge, but I needed something to go with my $2 taco.

The manager was helpful explaining the menu and what halal means. I didn't realize it was an organic/farm to table type place. 

Too bad the other customers had luke warm experiences but mine was very warm and I felt the price point for such a specific type of food style was appropriate.

"I feel a moral obligation to write this review. 

My husband and I had dinner here last Sunday, we arrived at dinner time and the place was a ghost town (should have been a clue) the service was good heck even the food tasted good however shortly after eating the appetizer my stomach became irritated. I didn't think much of it I figured I ate to fast. I was to full to eat any of my dinner so I had it boxed to take home. My husband on the other hand ate his meal which was grilled chicken. We paid the bill and headed home (which is only 15 minutes away). We didn't even get halfway home when suddenly my husband started getting severe stomach pain then he became increasingly nauseous. Luckily we made it home without any real troubles... that came later. My poor husband was in and out of bathroom all night. 

Now... I can't say for certain that he got food poisoning because he didn't see a doctor and we didn't get the food tested in a lab but in my opinion and his he got food poisoning. 
Of course about an hour into his bathroom adventure I decided to check out this establishments record with the department of health... let's just say had I checked them out first we would have NEVER gone there to begin with.",12,A,Carmel Kitchen & Wine Bar,Carmel Kitchen & Wine Bar,carmel kitchen & wine bar,1.0,NEGATIVE

"I found this restarant using poynt on my blackberry. It had two reviews but they were from locals so I value that more than reviews from tourist. 
The food is great and VERY low price, especially for the portions. Every entree is like under $6 fr the large size. Regular size is like $4. Its a small restaurant in a strip mall. I'd be cautous coming late at night as it seems to a questionable area. You can dibe it but there are only like two booths.
I had shrimp and crab fried rice which was seasoned so well. The egg roll was ok, I was dissapointed they only had duck sauce. I'm from Chicago and we like sweet and sour lol.

"How exactly does this place stay in business anyway?

It had been about five years since I visited any Cheesecake Factory, even though I live across the street from this particular location and walk by it regularly on my way to The Pub or Bar Louie.

For some reason, we decided to go there for a late evening dinner on a Saturday night just for convenience.

There's just absolutely no value to be had here and the quality of the product is not worth the price.

We did not even have an entree, instead splitting a salad with two small plates and one round of drinks that included a draft beer and a weak Moscow Mule that was not even served in the appropriate copper mug.

Service was provided by a woman who wore more makeup than the employees at the MAC store inside the mall itself. At least those ladies are selling it. This woman also bragged about how she spends her leisure time acting like a Disney princess. If you don't know, there's people who frequently do this when attending the parks that are not Disney employees. They act like they're part of the attraction, but they're not. They are screaming for attention...just like the guy who comes to a sports bar alone wearing his favorite team's colors and makes a huge production out of anything that happens in his team's game hoping to find a new friend who actually gives a shit.

$55 later, I came home hungry, thirsty, poured myself a second drink, made a sandwich and regretted the complete waste of money and time invested in the evening.

Thank goodness we did not both order entrees, a second round of drinks and dessert. Clearly a normal dinner here is going to run you around or upwards of $100 and I'd much rather spend that at a place that doesn't feel like it is a half step above a fast-casual lunch spot.

They make their own pasta, but they also sell their pasta if you'd like to cook some up at home yourself. They sell several different kinds of pastas- including different stuffed raviolis. I also got to try their chicken ""Pizza pop"" that was definitely good, but I'd order their pesto at least 10 more times before that. ;) I also had their caprese sandwich that they heated up for us and it was delicious as well. They gave us a side of marinara which really complimented the sandwich. The staff treated us like queens and even let us sample their tiramisu (which...was out of this WORLD delicious.

"Generous three star rating. I would probably say 2.25 stars but rounding up. 

Sadly I wish we had been told on arrival that the restaurant was in the middle of a soft opening and extremely understaffed when I took my family to a special occasion dinner last night. Just so we could manage expectations as we are a family of hospitality entrepreneurs!

Drinks service: slow to arrive. Took 10-15 mins plus multiple check-ins even for a bottled beer or glass of wine. 
Bussing service: no one seemed interested in clearing our table as we finished a drink or an appetiser. 
Mains: we ordered 2 steaks at $60 each and three sides, did not come out for over an hour and fifteen mins. 

The manager had checked on us early in the sitting but after waiting 45 minutes for our entrees, I had to track him down and asked if he could help with an update since the wait staff never bothered to acknowledge any delay. 

He proceeded to tell me he only had one person on the kitchen staff that evening and not even a dishwasher. Instead of getting a sincere apology or offers to help make our experience more pleasant while we waited, he only made excuses. 

Our ribeyes at $60 each were extremely fatty, the Mac and cheese was average and the asparagus was a sad little pile of about 6 small spears.

At minimum we could have received an apology and a comped round of drinks but instead got the $310 bill for three people after a disappointing experience. 

Very sad to have to write this because I support new business and also work in the service industry but I hope this encourages some action in getting this new restaurant up to par with its high price tag.

On Friday November 8th - Sunday November 10th is the annual St. John Greek Orthodox Church,  Tampa Greek Festival. 

It is well organized and a wonderful experience for the entire family. The food is all freshly prepared, generously sized and reasonably priced!

"Kind of gives me the impression of being a traditional Chinese take out joint with 6 tables in it. No decorations, no ambience, no mood, just an indoor food truck really. The proprietor is very nice and the woks are just behind the counter so you could technically watch them cook your meal. Crispy fried pork was our appetizer and it was awesome! It comes with a dipping sauce that tastes like a mix of Heinz 57 and buffalo sauces. Very different. We also asked for a side of sweet chili sauce. A very nice change of pace from the usual appetizers. My beautiful wife tried the chicken green curry and I tried the seafood combo Panang. Both were good, we both got runny noses from the heat but the cool thing was the heat didn't overpower the flavor and that was nice. The curries had different flavors than was we have traditionally experienced and different can be good. I guess I need to try authentic Thai food in order to determine what I should be tasting in American served Thai. So we have tried our normal meals so next time we will try the noodle soups.

"I had a hankering for Pad Thai and the pickings in Ybor are nonexistent, so I swung by Buddha Lounge to try them out.  If you're with pals lunch is fine here, but going solo was mind numbly boring.  The TV at the bar seems to be only for decoration because it was off the entire time I sat there.  The guy behind the bar, John, was cool... when he was there.  He spent most of his time running around the restaurant doing this, that and the other.  Nothing but bottles and a black screen to stare at.  Joy.

I ordered the Pad Thai extra hot because if it's not burning a hole in my stomach lining, it's not real Thai food.  When the dish came out the first thing that caught my attention were the four pieces of lime sitting on top.  That was new.  Plucking them off, I dug into it (friggin' starving at the time).

The heat was pretty good, a sauce based heat as opposed to the pepper based heat I adore.  The pieces of chicken were pretty fatty (like cheap wing meat) and really detracted from the meal.  With my hunger screaming in my belly I had to finish the dish.  Full, but not satisfied was the basic gist of my lunch.

The reason they get 3 stars and that I'm willing to try them again, was my waiter John.  When I mentioned the chicken was too fatty for the dish he offered to buy me dessert.  I'm not really a dessert with lunch kinda guy, so I declined.  When he brought the check I saw there was a discount applied instead.  That's a solid customer service move and totally unexpected.  For that alone, I'll come back and try one of their fried rice dishes which I hear are damn yummy.",0,A,Buddha Lounge,Buddha Lounge,Buddha Loung3,3.0,NEGATIVE

It's just really good pizza that happens to be new york style pizza, not just in name but also in characteristics and flavor.  The pizza has the right balance of sauce and cheese and the crust is crispy but is soft enough to fold. 

The slices are huge and resembles what you'll find in NYC.  Keep that in mind when ordering because the large pie is 22 inches, which is a lot of pizza

I got the Cuban bowl that had brown rice, pork, plantain chips and some sauce that pulled everything together. It was soooo good! 

My friends that I was with ordered the pizza and the smothered chips and they both mentioned how good theirs was too. 

Oh! One thing that I loved that was huge was my phone was dying and I needed the plug part of my charger (1st world problems).

"My Iced Latte (light simple syrup) was creamier than I preferred, which diluted the taste of coffee, but was still very good! In fact, my favorite is definitely their light roast hot black coffee that Little Doughnut House (closed) used to make because every sip awakened my soul that beckons me for another!

Usually, my go to is an Iced Vanilla/Caramel Latte (5/5). I decided to change it up with a hot Vanilla Matcha (4/5). It was good - earthy and not very sweet at all if you're okay with that. I saw the barista make it using a tea whisk to make sure there aren't any lumps in the green tea.

If you are a coffee drinker, I def. recommend:
Iced Caramel/Vanilla Latte: So goood because it's creamy w/whole milk & really great coffee taste that's bold with a mixture of Vanilla and Caramel. The Vanilla syrup is sugar-free and Caramel isn't, so it's a beautiful combo that's well balanced because I HATE it when it's too sweet!***

Also, love their music choices & reminded me of The 1975, an English pop rock band that I'm obsessed with! I love the consistent Lattes I get - the baristas always fulfill my caffeine addiction!

"I could not enjoy my food (not that it was amazing or anything) because of the disrespectful service I encountered. Me and my teenagers rode throughout Channelside on the electric scooters and stopped at Sparkman's for food. Being a pescatarian, my choices were limited and I settled on Swigamijg. The menu didn't really impress me but, we were hot and hungry so. Just wanted something light and simple. 
Boom. 

I ordered the shrimp + chips. When I heard my name called and looked at the dish I asked if they were sure, the guy confirmed. We just assumed that Edison's take on a simple meal was just bizarre. Okay. It was disgusting and I was just about to toss the crap (after eating one whole piece) when I heard my name called again. The staff was giving me dirty looks and I couldn't figure out why? Turns out, they had mixed up my order and given me someone else's piri piri or something. That explained the staff's side eye, and unnecessary comment that he noticed me eating someone else's food and rolling his eyes before walking off to tell his fellow jerk employee. 

Now. My first reaction was to apologize and tell them I didn't care for rectifying. Keep both nasty items please. The second rude employee thwn snatched the wrong food from my hand, tossed the replacement meal at me, and slammed the window in my face while angrily throwing the other meal in the garbage. My kids witnessed this and were mortified. If they weren't there I would have been a whole different person. You rude, disrespectful, petty, individual. It's not like I ever planned to eat that garbage again, and it's not even like I wanted to replace one disgusting meal with another from here.

"I've been wanting to stop by since the opening. But I am not big on fast food so I was a bit skeptical. 

After leaving the gym today (yes the gym,don't judge). Culvers appeared on the drive home. What better day to stop and grab a bite to eat. 

I thoroughly enjoyed the warm welcome and extremely clean interior. The staff all greeted us separately, each seeming quite genuine. We took a few moments to view the menu. 

I settled on the mushroom melt (I can't remember it's exact name). 

I grabbed a seat outside and waited for the food to be delivered. 


When it arrived I was pleasantly surprised by it's delicious presentation. I truly wanted to dive right in. The burger was sooo juicy and fresh. Every part was cooked to perfection. The burger tasted like a Swiss I would make at home. The fries were extra crispy and they gave me a variety of dipping sauces. 

Now I am a girl who loves to cook at home but the next time I'm feeling fast food I won't go straight for my go to PDQ. I'll have to flip on it and decide between there and Culvers!!!

"Konichiwa! This Japanese influenced food truck is new to the Tampa food truck scene and I had the opportunity to try it during the July 4th rally in Lutz where this and 28 other trucks were serving up some great street food. Their menu features Okinawan street fare like Soba Noodles w/ Chicken, Marinated Short-Ribs, Gyoza (pan-fried pork dumplings), and braised chicken wings.

I tried the Rafute Wrap which is a wrap with braised pork belly, rice, veggies, kimchi, and wasabi mayo. While the flavors were great, the pork belly was slightly on the chewy side. The wrap would have been perfect if the pork belly was melt-in-your-mouth tender and braised a little longer. The soba noodles I saw other people order looked really good, so I might have to try those next time. Overall, this super friendly truck adds more variety to the Tampa Food Truck family and I look forward to trying more of their food.

"I had received a coupon for Dominick's in the mail so I decided to use it. I knew nothing about the restaurant besides the information that was on the coupon that said they had ""over 50 delicious sandwiches"". I called and placed an order for a Cuban sandwich (for me) and a Philly cheese steak (which my had boyfriend wanted). So after we placed the order, I decided to check out Yelp and read the reviews, finding out it was Peruvian, and some of the other reviews weren't that well!! Obviously I should have came on here first! When I got there it wasn't exactly where I thought it would be. I got service from a woman there that was quiet and didn't have much of a smile on her face. She was very sweet when I tried to make conversation but just looked and seemed very bored.

Once I got home I opened my sandwich and mustard was all over the outside of my cuban, I took a bite and it was quite delicious besides all the mustard squeezing out and half of the meat, I took out some of the meat making it a lot easier to eat, overall my Cuban sandwich was great just very messy.

My boyfriend on the other hand opened his sandwich (Philly cheesesteak), looking very good he took and bite and it was just very over seasoned, it tasted like there was more than just salt added on it making it over-powering, and the meat was sort of chewy.  

Overall we both finished our meals, but probably not going their again. They weren't AMAZING, but they were not HORRIBLE either.",14,B,Dominick's Meat and Deli,Dominick's Meat and Deli,Dominick's Meat and Deli Inc.,3.0,NEGATIVE

We're new to the area and I would almost say regulars / we've visited at least 6 times in the past month and invited family and friends. 

I've asked a few times to substitute an appetizer (mushrooms) as a side which are actually cheaper than another side (onion rings) that has an up charge of $2.50 - happy to pay the up charge - even a dollar more if you say so - 

Adam says: ""Nope. The menu is what if is - take it or leave it"" 

Hmmm why are you the manager if you can't make an exception that is not going to cost your business any money and likely keep a local customer loyal? And why are you so rude? Are you just a jerk?

"I've visited this store on three separate occasions and each time the amount of staff present always out-numbered the customers (i.e. two working employees and one customer - me).  This SHOULD have been my red flag.  I first visited in early 2018 and purchased one meal that seems to be pretty ok, so this month I decided to return. 
 
Over the course of two weeks I brought 18 meals (14 Meals to Go and 4 from the Meal Plan).  I purchased 9 meals during each visit.  Out of the meals purchased only 3 were mildly appetizing (two were Meals to go and 1 was from the Meal Plan, which was ordered in advance).  The total cost, for both weeks was $160.  

All of the Meals that I purchased contained Poultry, except one which was included Beef (Pot Roast - Delicious and most tender cut of meat - Meal Plan Option).
 
The three meals that I did enjoy were:
Fit Chicken (Meal to Go)
Pot Roast (Meal Plan selection) 
- The only thing I would change is removing the Celery  
- just serve it with potatoes or add onion
Verde Chicken (Meal to Go)
 
 
Problems that I found with the other meals included:
Meals were not flavorful
Chicken Thighs were fatty and therefore contained less protein
Vegetables were poorly presented and didn't taste fresh as they were often hastily chopped (chunky when they should be sliced thinly, etc.) 
 
I pointed this out to the staff and was told that the meals were low-sodium, and thus not very flavorful.  I countered, offering that herbs can be used to season food and that healthy food doesn't have to be tasteless.  The solution offered was for me to pay for meal customization (which must be ordered in advance and cost extra) or to provide me with samples of their sauces and seasonings. 
 
After trying the samples (Fire-Roasted Salsa, Cilantro Lime, Clean Eatz Buffalo, Grecian), I deduced that the goal is to upsell Condiments and the Seasoning, to make their food edible.  Additionally, after sampling the offerings, the Seasoning is still flavorless and the Sauces taste like they are from the local Grocer.  The Salsa reminded me of watery Pace Picante Sauce, the Cilantro Lime was more lime and less Cilantro and the Buffalo sauce was just plan flat.  I didn't have the inclination to try the Grecian, after being disappointed by its predecessors. 
 
For my inconvenience the store reluctantly agreed to remove the cost of one of the meals from my last purchase, however they never did.  
 
Lastly, this store doesn't print out receipts, which I LOVE [provided that I can receive an itemized receipt through other means, which this store doesn't provide.  If printing a receipt is not an option, it shouldn't be displayed during the check-out process (it's misleading and falsely advertising something that is not available).  Also note that if you do want a receipt you have to opt to have it emailed, this does not automatically occur.  In doing so, the email receipt doesn't provide itemization however, only the total is offered.
 
I point this out because when I last check out, I was verbally quoted a total that was much lower than what I was actually charged and the cashier processed my payment so fast that I did not have the opportunity to request that my receipt be emailed to me. 
 
Essentially I was lied to, over charged and stuck with two weeks' worth of unappetizing meals.

"I haven't had a lot of luck with the local chain pizza delivery places. PJ's is usually lukewarm on arrival. PH arrives cold 1.5 hrs later, and is infuriating overall to deal with (see my other Yelp review of Pizza Hut). 

This is a great Dominos location. They deliver on time within the suggested window 99% of the time. It's piping hot and fresh 85% of the time - which is a fantastic track record for chain delivery, in my opinion.

"Wow, do I love this place.  Nothing much to look at on the inside or out, but the deliciousness of the food makes up for lack of ambiance.

Their burgers are crazy good. They have about 13 different varieties of burger offerings, plus they run specials all the time. They also offer steak and cheese sandwiches, chicken sandwiches, and salads (but why bother with a salad at an amazing burger joint?). 

Side orders of onion thangs, and loaded french fries are wonderful - but every burger order includes a side of french fries, so I rarely order another side item.

They also offer ice cream, milkshakes, and usually have an assortment of cakes for dessert.

Service is super friendly, and the food comes out surprisingly speedy, which is great because they do not accept phone orders.

"Generous two star rating for being a nice looking, clean establishment and for the food coming out super quick. My girlfriend and I came here for lunch this afternoon as I was in the mood for a sandwich. I ordered an Italian grinder and she ordered a steak sandwich and we shared an order of garlic knots. The bill came to 22 dollars for two sandwiches a small garlic knot and one small drink. I said to her these sandwiches better be huge for that price. Went to get a drink my girlfriend and I usually share one for we don't drink much. We got the unsweetened tea and asked the server for sweet and low or some other sort of sugar substitute. They did not have any.  We then sat down and the food came right out within two minutes. The sandwiches were big but it was all bread. Barely any meat on either of our sandwiches. My tomatoes were diced which I have never experienced before on a sandwich and her onions on her steak were the dice of minced onion spice lol. Both her sandwich and mine were both very tasteless and the bread even worse. I felt like I was eating crappy subway bread. The lunch meats were mediocre and her steak was dry and not seasoned well. The garlic knots were the best part of the meal and they were mediocre at best too. One was a little doughy but I guess that can happen.

"We dined here shortly after the restaurant opened. We had a reservation and were seated promptly. The restaurant is on the 6th floor and parking is available in the garage next door which is very convenient (it's like 2$ two parlor free depending on the time length). The valet parking is also validated so I was told. This is located in he Waterstreet area of downtown with views of the Hillsborough River. We had a 2 seat table near or against the wall which wasn't the best table or even ideal for the view and it was also very dimly lit. There was better seating (chairs with low coffee tables) near the edge with the best view, but they may have been reserved. The seating and the low cielings really took away from the ""rooftop"" vibe as this floor is separated by the pool and lounge area and that is completely roofless and open air, but you can't eat over there.

Anyway, our waitress was neither friendly or completely rude she just did her job. She did make a few comments that bothered me like about my weight and how much I eat or what I would eat; I really don't like that. As for her checking on which menu items were gluten free because I have Celiac Disease she did and everything was 100% safe. I am highly sensitive to gluten and had no issues with the food. It did take a while to come out because they said they were making sure everything was gluten free and not cross contaminated so I REALLY appreciate that.

I wasn't sure what would be safe for me on the menu which was a deterrent for visiting, but I was very happy with the food. It was all great, it tasted great, it looked great, and everything was safe for me to eat. Everything had a lot of bold flavor in my opinion and I would return here if they had new menu items seasonally.",34,C,Six,Six,Six,4.0,NEGATIVE

I came in wanting to go for the vermicelli bun with pork but had to try the specialty dish of caramelized catfish with pork belly and it was also very good. Be careful for the bones in this one though as there were a few more then I was expecting.

"Honey's is half bar and half restaurant.  One of those Drinking-Family-Friendly places.  When I went at 9PM on a Saturday night, the restaurant section was filled with middle school aged cheerleaders and their parents.  The bar was pretty empty, I presume because the drinkers were mostly out front smoking.  There were plenty of big screen TVs (mostly tuned to the same game, unfortunately) and that online trivia game that some bars have.  There's also an arcade room. 

The menu is your basic pub fare: buffalo wings, pizza, salads, burgers and fries.  I went for the wings and I have to admit that they were some of the best wings that I've had in awhile.  Honey's fries tasted great too- fresh cut, but were served almost cold.  My husband- who's something of a pepperoni pizza snob- tried Honey's pizza and wasn't terribly impressed although he did manage to finish it.  But remember, he's a snob.  The bill wasn't bad either.  Very reasonable.

I don't have much to say about the service, but our waitress/bartender may have been having an off night.

At the end of the day- I may go again.  The wings were pretty F-ing good.  But then again, maybe I won't... There are plenty of other bars on Dale Mabry that will serve me cold fries and make me wait for my beer.",39,C,Honey's,Honey's,Honey's,3.0,NEGATIVE

I must say though this particular dish is extremely spicy and I just get the normal order or level and I just learned the other day that you can get it even spicier as it comes in a 1,2 or 3 spice level. I don't know who can handle the 3.

Cheesecake - not so much!  All four of us tried it and all were not pleased at all.  It had a very strong peanut butter and coconut taste, nothing at all like a cheesecake.  One of the servers came over and talked to us and knew that we didn't like it.

"What can I say... I should have expected it. The let down was expected. 

This is my second time going to Pei Wei. The reason I didn't write a review after the first time was because I was underwhelmed and I thought it would get better with another try. 

The food is made to order and super fresh. However, there is just not one thing I ate that I was wowed by. I actually just finished my take out and looked at the left overs and decided I might as well throw it away because I probably will not eat the rest. 

I'm not saying this place is bad. According the the slew of people that was there when I picked up my food, it must have a good following. Unfortunately, I will not be one of them. 

I should've known better to go to a chain restaurant (except Chiptole) and expect amazing food that will satisfy every craving I have at the moment. The place has the potential. The service is awesome. I'm sure there is something on the menu I would like, I'm just giving up now.  Maybe someday in the future I'll walk in their door with zero expectations and have a delicious plate of food.

"A subsequent visit to Streetcar Charlie's solidified their higher star rating for me.

For one, I was wrong about the beer selection. They have quite a few special bottled beers and one seasonal tap - just ask and they'll give you a list of what's available.

But the real reason that I'm reviewing them again is the level of neighborhood friendliness and service that I received the other night.

I walked in around 11pm, fresh off a plane from New York, kinda tired, but not wanting to go home. I asked if they had a late night menu, which they do, but the kitchen was closing since it was a weeknight. Totally understandable, so I said I would just have a beer.

The bartender was undeterred, however, from finding me food. ""You can't just have an empty stomach!"" she decried and promptly went into the kitchen. A minute later, she came out of the kitchen, beaming, with a bowl of clam chowder that was freshly made a few hours before.

""There, we can't have you starving,"" she told me, lining up Tabasco sauces and crackers.

Most places I've been to would have just pulled the late night menu out of my hands and plopped the beer in front of me, informing me that they were closing soon...but not Streetcar Charlie's.

So, I thought it responsible to share my experience. I do this for two reasons, first and foremost, my hopes are the owner takes heed and makes the necessary changes. I don't want a refund or a credit. I just want them to make it right. And second, folks need to know. I know there are others that read reviews and I feel strongly about sharing my disappointment so an informed decision based on others' experiences can be made.  After all, I tried this place instead of my go to Chinese restaurant place based on recommendations from my neighborhood FB page. I can assure you, I won't make that mistake again.

We ordered the crab rangoon, dumplings fried (choice was fried or steamed), hot and sour soup and General Tso's chicken with house special fried rice. 

The crab rangoon was empty! Yes, empty. Those that know understand these delectables typically are filled with cream cheese. Well, on a few there were traces of cream cheese but believe me when I tell you they were not filled. The red dipping sauce for the rangoon was so runny it was like water. 

The fried dumplings looked like they were freezer burned and the dipping sauce that came with these, flavorless. My son, tho said they were, ""Ehh"". 

Next we tried the hot and sour soup. Hot for this soup should be the operative word, right? No heat whatsoever and it smelled funny. It was more liquid than substance which I probably could have overlooked had the FLAVOR AND HEAT been on task. 

Finally, the biggest disappointment was the General Tso's chicken. Again, typically there is some heat to this dish and I usually ask they turn that heat up a couple of notches but since I had never had their General Tso's, I opted to have it as they served it. Not only did it lack ANY heat it lacked any flavor...at all!! I'm not sure how that happens but somehow they achieved it. AND, the chicken was over cooked; it was hard. Every.single.piece. 

Now for something positive.The house special fried rice was actually not bad. It had ample shrimp and they were tasty. I did add some soy sauce, my own because they provided none, and while it may not have been the best I have had, it was good. 

So, to wrap it up, out of the five items, one made the cut. Did they get lucky on that one or is maybe the fried rice their one trick pony? You now have my review so, you decide... if you're feeling adventurous.",14,B,China Moon,China Moon,ChinaMoon,1.0,POSITIVE
My first time here and I will definitely be back.  I had a Thai salad (garden salad with peanut dressing) and chicken satay ($7.50 for 4 skewers).

"New York Buffet is a horrible option if you want variety and a clean restaurant. The waitstaff is very rude. My experience was better with family than alone. All the food was cold and old. Especially the seafood.

When I arrived I was quoted one price then I was asked to pay up front which was confusing because not only was a I charged a higher price but I thought you pay after you eat at these establishments. I was told it was more because HE added taxes and gratuities.

So I paid for the buffet upfront without seeing what was being served and I was seated by a central air unit leaking dirty water. My waitress never addressed me or came to visit my table outside of her dropping off a drink while I was getting a plate.

I ended up eating fruit and soup because no  fresh food was out just scraps of what was left out. The food wasn't labeled correctly or at all. There wasn't a good, great or even okay selection.

During my time their I noticed other tables receiving checks.

So I said excuse me to the waitress which she tried so hard to ignore me until she couldn't and I asked her why was I charged up front and everyone else is being charged afterwards. She literally laughed and walked off. She never came back with an answer instead she sat at a table in the front of the restaurant eating her lunch.

At this point I addressed the guy who originally charged me and I asked him can I speak to a manager. He then says ok what happened. He never said yes I am the manager. He never apologized for the service or lack there of. So I asked him why was I charged upfront instead of after my meal. I even told him how his employee laughed when I asked her. And his exact response was because you wanted to pay first. Wow. 

So I left and just called my credit card company to dispute the charge and I also reported them for unsanitary conditions and practices.

And also people leaving 5 stars for this dump had to be high, hungry or an employee because they definitely do not deserve three, four or even five stars.

Again do not eat here. There are other restaurants that deserve your money. New York Buffet gets an F in my book.",26,B,New York Buffet,New York Buffet,New York Buffet Inc.,1.0,NEGATIVE

"So I'm certain this place will ultimately settle at 3 stars because most people aren't as tolerant of mediocrity, but...

Value speaks volumes for me these days, and this joint is a dead ringer for that label.  Forget that the ""specials"" food items may not be the perfect temp.  Accept that they will offer neither the best table service nor attentive hosting.  Assume cramped seating and unforgiving table sizes if you choose to dine in or out front.  Oh, and prepare yourself for zero condiments available at your table too.  If you can handle those things, then come in for a simple weekday dinner that is altogether different and affordable.  

We all loved the chicken soup.  It makes you thirsty, but at the same time contains chopped up bone-in chicken so my daughter could learn the flavor benefits of marrow to brothy soups.  More refined restaurants will hide this fact by removing those pieces and charging double.  

The roast pork smothered in red beans and sauce served over a bed of yellow rice disappeared quickly and filled me up for $6.  It was seasoned enough to appease my need for hot sauce while simultaneously not requiring a glass of water for sodium balance.

We all thought the tamales were odd and represented the low point of the meal, but then again we are from Chicago and Tom Tom Tamales definitely represent a less ambiguous approach to this dish.  Covering lukewarm corn based mush in a lukewarm corn based wrap is not what we expected.  

But I digress...

It would be great if I could gush over everything we experienced, however the truth is you should come here.  Either get take-out dinner specials to warm in your microwave or wait for made-to-order from the kitchen...or arrive exactly when they fill the ""specials"" food line.

The thinly sliced red onions, cilantro and lime juice is refreshing - so deeelicious!! Also, the Pervuian corn, cancha (toasted corn) & sweet potatoe balances the citrus.

"I'm not sure what the second star is for... I guess the server was nice enough and it wasn't super-expensive.   Mom recommended, so we went... but this definitely feels like a recession-era restaurant trying to hang on.  Arrived at 9PM with a few other tables.  Front 7-11 style glass doors opened directly into dining room... very strange that there is no partition for privacy.  But that's the least of the problem...

Boring salads with cold bacon (cold fat doesn't taste good), old candied walnuts.

One main was a shrimp mac & cheese which tasted like it was a recipe off the back of a box.  Some overcooked/bland/crap shrimp on thin-tasting macaroni.

Next main was the highly-recommended NY steak.  Ordered ""very rare"" and came very medium, cooked too hot so the outside 1/4"" was leather.  Some innocuous mushroom/cheese/breadcrumb topping was fine, but the steak was mercifully small.  Served with 8 unseasoned, overcooked green beans and well-cooked but oddly sour fingerling potatoes.

Final was ""carnitas"" (about 20% of dishes are Mexican).  This was far and away the best of the mains... lots of cinnamon which I liked, but the rice/sour cream/packaged tortillas didn't help.

Dessert (we were really trying to salvage something out of this): a piece of chocolate cake that was (get this) taken out of the display case.  It was as stale as you would imagine.  Praline ice cream was fine but tiny and boring.  Lemon tart was fresh-cooked (actually fresh-undercooked) with an OK bottled curd topping.  

Two glasses of reasonably-priced wine were both oxidized - not destroyed, but not super-enjoyable.

It's pretty much like any other Sbarro.  Out of all the places in the food court at International Plaza, we chose this one because it was fast, and in reality, we only needed a snack rather than a full meal.

Of course, the slices are huge and we were all pleasantly surprised at the freshness of the toppings; in this case, mushrooms and spinach.  The only detraction for me was the crust.  I'm used to a New York style crust, which is thinner than what you'll find at Sbarro.  It felt more like eating bread with toppings rather than pizza.

"Yelpers rejoice: a father and son are running a hole-in-the-wall that takes something familiar (pizza) with an unfamiliar twist. We eat this stuff up. Literally.

Detroit-style pizza may be new to Tampa, so I'll break it down like a cheap import: you start with the crust on the bottom, of course, but after that everything's reversed. Toppings go directly onto the crust, followed by so much cheese that it flows out to the edge of the pan and dies a delicious crispy death. Tomato sauce goes on top.

We went for the $12 dinner deal: a 1-topping large pizza, which feeds 3-4 people who aren't pizza hogs like I am, with an order of garlic breadsticks and a 2-liter bottle of soda. The guy behind the counter (the son in the father-and-son team) heard us talking about how I drink diet cola and she drinks Mountain Dew, and offered to split it into two cans. Absurd unless you're us; it was actually more valuable split up like that. Smart business move.

The breadsticks, even topped with cheese for an extra 50 cents, weren't particularly Detroity; they give Pokey Stix a run for their money, though. The pizza, which we also split up (half pepperoni, half mushroom -- and yeah, they only count that as one topping, not two), was distinctly better than most pizza I've eaten in Tampa. (Atlantans will recognize it as similar to Jagger's.) 

Again with the thoughtful: the one-man band running Pizza Squared separated the toppings so neatly that I didn't eat a shred of pepperoni, and defied Detroit tradition to put the mushrooms on top so I'd know which side was mine. Very helpful, and btw not completely unfortunate looking either, if anyone wants to play Who Wants To Marry a Cute Pizzeria Operator Who Also Plays in a Band That Sometimes Rehearses in the Aforementioned Pizzeria. (If you're taken, sir, or not marriage-minded, my apologies. I try to mention ALL the charms of a business.)

You'll drive past Pizza Squared the first time because it's in a little strip mall south of Fowler, across from the Yuengling bottling plant, and you'll be paying attention to the traffic cones (probably a good choice). That's okay. Turn around and come back. Next time you won't drive past it without stopping.",4,A,Pizza Squared,Pizza Squared,PizzaSquared,5.0,NEGATIVE

Nice people, but, uhhh,, don't know how to cook.  Threw out the menu, never again.

Pizza was so soggy, it dripped thru the box... and even worse, there was no meat on the pizza,, and about 3 shreds of cheese.

"Went there on a coupon, which was not honored due to change in ownership.  And it took a while to get that straight because the server spoke virtually no English....so just pointing at the menu did not work.  The owner was fairly brusque, unapologetic and offered no accommodation.  At other places where that happened, we at least got an apology  & comp drink or app.  It is just good business to try to win the food will of first-time visitors.

We then had to go through the point & Spanglish effort of ordering...and the server had to keep going back to the owner to check and several things were not available tonight.  So we settled for what was available, and it was not real tasty.  We have had Honduran food before and so we had a basis for comparison.

I've had the general tso chicken, boneless spareribs, chicken lo mein, and fried rice. All of these items have been very good to exceptionally good. My favorite is definitely the general tso chicken.

"I gave a sports bar five stars...Yes I did boo! Let me tell you why. A few days ago, I was out front reading their menu and I noticed that they serve a Cuban sandwich and my mind went back to my meat eating days when I used to DEVOUR Cuban sandwiches in Miami. I walked in and asked a very nice young woman at the bar if I could alter that sandwich to include everything else that comes on it except the meat. She decided to go the extra mile and ask the chef to add a few veggies. I thought to myself, what a sweet girl for doing this for me. I asked for my sandwich to go because I had to go to work. Well when I arrived at work (directly across the street), I opened the container and ALL EYES WERE ON MY BEAUTIFUL SANDWICH! The chef made a masterpiece! She had carefully sliced Zucchini, Squash, Peppers, onions, mushrooms, and added lettuce, tomato, and Swiss cheese and pressed this sandwich to toasted perfection. The vegetables were at the perfect thickness and were grilled just right (not too soft or too firm). My sandwich was served with waffle fries. One of my coworkers tasted a piece of zucchini and was amazed at how delicious it was. Well I went back the next day and at this point, I felt like a nuisance but I was craving that amazing sandwich again. The chef made it for me with no problem. I was wondering if it would taste the same AND YES IT DID! I even spoke to the manager on how great the sandwich was and asked that they give my compliments to the chef!

This place: let's see. Ordered a passion fruit slush with lychee popping boba and cheese foam...It was ohhhhh soooo sweet.. I did overhear they do not customize the sweetness.

I ordered a Banh mi special. It looks like a really good size Banh mi, but it is actually really skinny compared to others I have had. The filling is also quite sparse. One slice here, one slice there, not the pronounced Banh mi flavor that I love so much.

I also ordered 6 croissants and two desserts. Yes I ordered a lot and it was just okay... not outstanding not stand-outish, not memorable. The quality and the price just did not match. 

There's so many dessert options also, but they have general labels. It's a new shop but perhaps they should have clear labels so the people working can let the customers know what they are ordering. What if they have allergies?!",36,C,Banh Mi Factory,Banh Mi Factory,B@nh Mi F@ctory,2.0,NEGATIVE

"So I'd reviewed Pach's at its previous location on Bay to Bay. They've now moved to the Tahitian Inn on South Dale Mabry. I think it was a very good move for them. Pach's is a well-established South Tampa favorite, and had been in the small corner of an office building for a long time. The place was getting a little long in the teeth, and was quite small.

The new location has a much larger dining room with some outside covered dining. The Kitchen is separated from the dining area unlike the old location, and the décor is fresh, clean, and airy.

I think they may have raised prices slightly, but it is still a bargain for the quantity and quality of the food. And the menu is all the same stuff. I tried French Toast for the first time, and it was very good. Lay's pancakes were good as always, and his country fried steak with gravy was even better than at the old place. Eggs, bacon and sausage were, as usual, perfectly cooked as ordered.

I think it was all the same wait staff, but they seemed a bit more relaxed. That could be because, unlike the old location, they now have room to walk between the tables, .

The only issue is parking. It appeared the hotel parking was all full with hotel guests (there's just not a lot), but we confirmed they have made arrangements with the church next door to use their lot for overflow. Based on the cars, we were worried about the crowd, but we walked right in and were seated, and there were empty tables.

"The Rusty Pelican is a great example of a restaurant that is successful because of its location. There are some beautiful views- but overall it felt like an upper class Applebee's. Check my reviews. It is rare that I give such a low review. Rusty Pelican slowly worked hard to earn it. 
First, we called the day before our early reservation and asked for a water view. We were told our party of 7  could not have a water view due to social distancing despite us being sat in an entirely empty dining room. That was empty for a good 45 minutes before they ended up seating all three tables in front of the window that they refused to allow us to sit at. 
The food is average. Everything drowning in sauce or cheese. I ordered the lobster tail and requested no sauce. It came basically poached in butter. The broccolini?-same. I ended up just eating the cornbread which was actually really good. My husband ordered the crab stuffed grouper (40$) and described it as average. Overall it felt like banquet food but the kind that was just ok. 
The two stars are solely given for the service. of our waitresses who were great and brought a complimentary dessert for our special occasion.

Serving lunch and dinner with a dozen entrees including standards like fried/baked/BBQ chicken, port ribs, turkey wings. oxtails, and even chitterlings.    Only $7.99 for most with rice, cornbread and choice of two sides, including collard greens, mac & cheese, beans/potatoes, okra/tomatoes, cabbage, limas, candied yams etc.   To maximize tasting range, my wife & I shared stewed turkey, meatloaf, greens, limas, mac & cheese and candied yams.  Best sides I have had in a long time with most well stewed and superbly seasoned/doctored.    Fresh crispy salad and other veggie alternatives are available...but why go that route in a soul food source?

Served with hospitality and pride in a tiny, bright yellow strip-mall unit directly across from Taco Bell.

"So yesterday was my birthday, and of course I celebrated with roller coasters at Busch Gardens. First, I opted for my first ""old lady"" 4pm dinner. It works out great since Olive Garden is always dead at 4pm so no wait, and tOn my way! to digest before SheiKra plummets me to the earth. I digress. 

We arrive at like 3:30, and there are a few tables. Nothing serious. I worked for OG for a bit at one point so I am always excited. A few fun facts: their workers get there at 7am to make all of their sauces and prep ingredients. No it is not all frozen. Actually there's one tiny, hardly ever used microwave in some olive gardens but no. Your meal isn't microwaved. 

So anyways. Our server did not give ANY cares about anything. I ordered chicken carbonara. I was sure to state not chicken and shrimp. Just chicken. Cool. It came out with chicken and shrimp. Dude was like ""yeah I guess the kitchen made a mistake"" nope. I clearly saw on the ziosk where you rang in chicken and shrimp carbonara but guy never came back so I could let him know. Okay fine. A girl brought me some breadsticks. I was fine. They re-made my meal. No manager (shout out to my old team for doing major damage control EVERY TIME something went wrong) and I didn't get a chance to use my bday dessert coupon.  

The food was amazing. Just my birthday meal left so much to be desired. If I was a regular patron who didn't know what to expect, I would never ever go back. Too bad my significant other took the survey. No bro didn't offer me a wine sample, appetizer, or upsell anything. He didn't even give us his name. I'm in the business till I graduate nursing school.

Damage control is great at Chick-fil-A though. And the service is amazing. They fixed it immediately and gave me an additional 3 pieces of chicken strips.

"I used to HATE The Rack. It is known be flirt with being as douchey as the Hyde Park Cafe. I'd honestly avoid the AUCD on Fridays. It's super crowded and you might get puked on by a UT Student. However, the all you can drink for ladies on Saturday is a great place to hit before you go out at night! 

I go to the Rack primarily as a restaurant. I like that they have a wide variety of food. I've got a picky eater as a roomie and best friend so it's great because I can get sushi and she can get a burger. I've been pleasantly surprised by the sushi's quality. All the rolls that I've tried have been solid, some even great. The yummy dip is a great appetizer. It's essentially spinach artichoke dip with crab baked on top. I'm not sure how that couldn't be good! The reason that the Rack isn't getting 4 (or even 5) stars is the service. I've been to the rack 3 or 4 times over the last couple of months. The first time, the service was good even though it was crowded. The next times we had the same waitress and it was awful. Last time I was there, I refilled my tables' waters twice after she would run past our table without looking up (even though it wasn't particularly busy). I also went to the bar to get another drink after waiting for 15-20 without being able to track her down. I wish I had her name because I don't think the service of the restaurant is necessarily bad. I got my drink at the bar really fast. 

The rack has a fun, young atmosphere and great specials almost every day of the week. It's also conveniently located if you plan on hitting up Howard for a night out afterwards!

"Why 4 stars? Because only inconsistent hours hold it back from 5.

Quality eats, at student prices. Nothing about your experience feels like you're enjoying a high-end meal... until you place some food in your mouth. It's definitely a strange thing to be sitting on the 2nd story dining room of the Art Institute, in a very bright, naturally lit setting -but your mouth says you're at a dimly lit, romantic institution. My steak should have been over $20, but it was about $8. 

The ratio of employees:customers was hilarious. We were the first to arrive and there was about 20 hosts/servers just waiting to help us. While we waited for our food and while we ate, they all just stood near the door... waiting to host or serve someone. 

This is a very unique experience that everyone should try out at least once, but the problem is that the hours are all over the map. The best thing to do is to try and call ahead to find out when they will be open. Other than that, there's no telling.",16,B,The Tutored Chef,The Tutored Chef,The Tutored Chef Inc.,4.0,NEGATIVE
"Had dinner here last night after hearing rave reviews on Next Door. They were not wrong! We were seated promptly after arriving around 6pm. Most people coming in had reservations. It's not a large restaurant, so I would definitely recommend reservations. There was plenty of seating at the bar though. They have an impressive wine selection and a full bar. Our waiter, Luigi, was friendly and prompt with service. We ordered the crab cake appetizer, which was AMAZING!  For entrees, I had the filet mignon and hubby had the black grouper. Both were superb. My steak was served with au gratin potatoes and grilled asparagus. The sauce on the steak was very tasty as well. Hubbys grouper was fresh and cooked perfectly, served with polenta and broccoli. We also split a side of mac and cheese, which was very tasty! I loved how other severs and manager all pitched in to provide stellar service! It's a little pricey, but they do have a ""bar menu"" with some less expensive options.

"Yum. I was just dreaming of my mom's cooking, and then comes Carlos checking in to the new Pao Cafe. It just opened on Thursday, August. 21st. Love checking out brand new places. I honestly never tried their food truck, but happy we tried this place. It's not like my moms cooking, but nothing can compare to food u grew up with. 
Chicken adobo was very good and flavorful. It is shredded chicken w a soy sauce type sauce. I liked it so much I would have rather had more chicken than white rice. Don't want the white rice filling up my belly too fast. 
The lumpia( fried spring rolls) w beef and raisin were very good too. I'm so use to getting the frozen ones at the Asian store that these were my favorite.  
The coconut chicken siapao(steam bun)was not my fave. It was more dough and tiny pieces of coconut flavored chicken. Glad I tried it bc I would have always wanted to know. 
I will definitely be back and I want to try to tocsilog, mango Turon, Mami noodles, beef soup, and the filipino nachos, and whatever else I can try. If anyone wants to check it up, let me know, and I will meet up lol,
I would love to see fresh filipino spring rolls on the menu, and other stuff in the future.

"Good restaurants are often found in strange places. Cafe De Siam is one of these cases. Located in a somewhat run down strip mall (where Cody's is at) few people would consider stopping by.  But if you like Thai food, or even if you just want a pleasant oriental dining experience, you should visit Cafe De Siam.

It's small but cozy.  Very well decorated.  But the draw is the friendly service and the outstanding cuisine.  I'm a big fan of Shu-mai (steamed pork dumplings), and what they serve here is among the best I've tasted.  The spring rolls are nice and crispy, and the accompanying plum sauce is delicious.  I've posted pictures to help you visualize!

Their lunch specials menu is small but varied, and for $6.95 it's a steal.  My favorite is #5, the Preow Whan (Sweet and Sour chicken Thai style).  If I'm in a rush I'll get #8, Cau-Pad, which is essentially a lot of chicken fried rice.  It reheats very well.

"I am giving this 'pasta bar' 4 stars because the food was delicious, but the service wasn't appreciated. My hungry family went in not knowing this place was take out only and we had a starving 2 year old. After we ordered over $50 of food, I asked the lady if she had a piece of bread or something to hold my son over until the food was ready, she quoted 20-30 min until food was ready. She said she couldn't give  us any because it was all wrapped up. I the back. I had to leave my husband to wait for the order and load my son up in the car and take him to a gas station to get him a snack. I cannot wrap my head around leaving a restaurant to get food. When I went to go pick up my husband from the restaurant, the order was ready, and there was literally a whole baguette in the bag. Why didn't the lady give us that and take it out of our order, or charge me for extra bread? I am upset that we had to leave and go somewhere else to get my son a snack while we waited for our order.

"We went to the Sugar Factory last night for my friend Chris' birthday. We had a party of 7 for his event. First and foremost, the food was actually pretty good. I had the club sandwich and I had a couple of bites of the fettuccini and, in truth, it was pretty good. Also, the food prices are actually on par with a Chili's or Red Robin, so you aren' t going to break the bank on the meal. 

But.....

The place is INCREDIBLY BRIGHT. What does that mean? The walls are white and the lights are turned up all the way so you're constantly blinking. If you get a booth, make sure you're not sitting in a CHAIR, opposite the booth wall. The chairs have no back support. I spent the whole dinner sitting straight up and down and when dinner was over, I stood up, and was REALLY sore, like I just did a back work-out.  I know it makes me sound like an old man, but the chairs are SO BAD they're worth mentioning. I also get that the place is supposed to be fun and it's supposed to be an ""atmospheric"" meal experience, but the DJ had the music turned WAY up, so much so I was screaming to be heard across the table.... and for some reason, he kept playing with the volume..... AND he would play 45 seconds of every song before switching. It was like a 7 year old with ADD who drank 7 Red Bulls got ahold of an iPod set on ""shuffle.""

Our bill was $78 for 2 people. The drink that you see pictured .....  WAS $38 OF THAT. Yes, that bubbly Gatorade looking thing cost about as much as it costs to take me and my son to Outback. My wife said that they skimp on the alcohol in that drink too.... oh, by the way, if you can't finish that drink, you can't get a to-go cup to walk through the casino. Restaurant policy. 

I appreciate what they're trying to do with this place, but if you're looking to have ""dinner,"" this isn't the place.  It's loud, aggravating, and when I got home, my ears were literally ringing (a first for a restaurant visit).

We were excited about the proximity of this new place. The first disappointment came with the service. Slow and  unfriendly, our waiter handed us the menu and quickly walked away. Our first order was Thai coffee, which tasted very bitter, a stark departure from habitual drinks. Then came the beef salad, which flavors was different from standard. The salad was drizzled in what tasted like Italian salad dressing.  The peppered shrimp was ok. My sister did not like the beef Salad and had it sent back. We also canceled the rest of our order since the simple orders were already subpar. Shortly after doing so, the owner/cook came out and asked what happened. My sister explained that this is not what she is used to, and that the beef salad tasted like Italian salad dressing. The owner proceeded to say that this was her version and that she would have to charge for the salad. Neither of us had mentioned payment at this time. My sister was taken aback, and said that she wouldn't pay for something she didn't eat. The owner then said that she has to pay for rent, electricity and her groceries which were not cheap. I didn't see how it had anything to do with us but ok. We were going back and forth about paying for what we had but not what she barely touched.

I recently noticed China Legend in a shopping center near my house. While I didn't have super high hopes that it would be much different than any other Chinese takeout experience, I put it on my to-do list based on how conveniently located it was.

It turned out to be right about what I expected. Has any Chinese takeout restaurant in the history of the world ever had any variance to it? It's literally like all ten million of them in America are all just sister restaurants under the same corporate umbrella.

Actually, that's not totally true. I did notice something on the menu here that I'd never seen before. Mei Fun, which are these thin rice noodles, caught my eye, so I went with that.

It was fine. Not a bad meal, but not something I'm dying to try again. With that being said, I'd give China Legend another shot next time I'm craving Chinese food.

As usual the potato is huge, so I ate about half and saved the rest for a second meal. The brookie was really yummy, I heated it up at home later. I recommend heating it if possible. 

Online ordering was easy. Curbside pickup was a bit confusing because apparently the cops park their cars in the McAlister pick up spaces for long periods of time at the location near the mall.

"I'm all about a salad bar and while this is not as extensive a spread as Sweet Tomatoes (the Mecca of salad bars) and maybe a quarter or two more pricey (you pay by the weight), it was pretty good.  There were many fresh looking options, lots of bean salads, chicken and tuna were available, and fresh avocado that was cut fresh as it was picked up so it wouldn't brown. I appreciate the ample toppings as well, lots of different kinds of nuts, seeds, and a good selection of dressings. This place is tucked away downtown and has never been crowded when I've been there.  The owners are continually changing out the salad bar with fresh options and I've never had a piece of rotten lettuce (blech ugh gross).

"Really wanted to like this place, especially with the friendly and charming servers.  But we were disappointed. I had a yen for a Moroccan soup, but early on a Saturday evening the restaurant was out of all three soups offered on the menu. And only two of the seven offered salads were available.  We settled for fried kibbe app and these were O.K. although they seemed pre-prepared and then microwaved before serving. For entrees, only four of the eight selections were available. Spouse and I shared the stuffed eggplant special of the day. The taste was passable, but the texture was mush; in my portion, I appreciated only one bitefull which tasted like eggplant. We also shared the Kafta Kebab entrée which was dry but tasted O.K. Both entrees seemed microwave-heated.  The basmati rice was excellent and a small house salad comprised fresh chopped iceberg lettuce, chopped tomato, cukes, and grated cheese with a vinegar/oil dressing; not bad, but not particularly inspired.",17,B,International Fresh Kitchen,International Fresh Kitchen,Int3rnational Fr3sh Kitch3n,2.0,NEGATIVE

"I had always been a huge supporter of Estella's for about 10 years. That all ended when my wife and I went for an early dinner on Monday evening. 

Having been a regular for years we sort of had a routine of chips and queso, salsas (including the hotter on for me) followed by our meals which we would take most of home. 

This week was no different. The wife ordered her 2 tacos and I the #1 combo with beef. After filling up on the chips and salsa I wound up only having the taco there and brought the 2 burritos and rice home. As we left my wife wanted to go to the little ice cream shop down the street. 

No sooner had we gotten inside the ice cream shop and a bout of food poisoning stated up. It's now been over 40 hrs since the leaving the restaurant and the fever, stomach pain and other even more undesirable symptoms still exist. This is the worst bout of food poisoning I can ever remember having. I know for a fact that the poising came from the meal I/we ate at Estella's on Monday 3/26. My guess is the contaminated item on this visit was the spicy salsa since its the only thing I had which the wife did not.

Since reading some other reviews where others having repeatedly gotten food poising at multiple of their locations ...... I'll NEVER go again. I have had problems with about a dozen visits to Estella's over the last 10 years where I'd have immediate stomach issues thereafter but never really chalked it up the food quality or food poisoning for one reason or another. Looking back on it now, the last visit prior to this one also left myself and a coworker with food poisoning after having lunch at the location on S Dale Mabry. 

Now begins the search for the best Mexican place in the bay (any suggestions welcome).

"I love Soobak! They have quite literally ruined me for any other sushi restaurant. The only reason I give them 4 stars instead of 5 is that there have been several occasions when my family and I try to go there during their normal business hours and they are unexpectedly closed. If this happened only once or twice I could write it off, but they are typically pretty active on their Facebook page and when they have it listed that they are open--I expect to drive there and see an open establishment. From now on I will call ahead to make sure they are indeed open in order to avoid the disappointment I was faced with tonight. 

That being said, the food is incredible! Their Volcano Roll is something that I find myself going through withdrawals over. The staff is always very polite and helpful and generally fun to talk to. It is a very tiny establishment--not a lot of seating and nothing really fancy. I'm not one for aesthetics anyway; the food is worth the drive and the money (which is still very reasonable). Normally if I had a hard time reaching a business by phone and their Facebook page said they were open and I had to find out the hard way that they are closed, I would be very turned off and probably not come back. But let this be a testament to the awesomeness of their food. I am disappointed, even saddened, when they are closed, but I will always try again and again and again because those Volcano Rolls with tiny scallops on top are worth it.

This place is a bit pricey as the first impression. The tuna ceviche that is served free with tostadas and tomatoes, cucumber, and salsa just tasted like amped up canned tuna. No biggie.

The horchata was quite watered down. The torta was quite small like really small and the chicken for the fajitas were a bit off and bland and a bit rubbery.

The Gyro meat in the Gyro was cold. Why is the meat of the Gyro COLD? Blows my mind, that you shave the meat from the vertical rotisserie, char it on the grill to wake it up and serve it! Well that did not happen. So I ate it cold. No, I didn't go and complain, because we already shamed them once over the Chicken Wings. And you know....

Yes, this is a chain (think Subway but with pitas, and fresh healthy ingredients instead of the typical crap) but they must be franchised because each location is very different. 

This location is open super late. I've ended my partying here on several occasions. And on other occasions I've started my partying here. In any event, PIta Pit is in the equation when I take a trip downtown. They also deliver to those in the area, and judging by how quick the guy hops in that buggy and returns, it must be pretty speedy delivery.

They have toppings ranging from hummus, spinach, feta cheese, your typical veggie toppings, and then tons of sauces, even tzatziki sauce. Definitely give it a try. It's basically a fast food joint, though, so don't expect any bells or whistles or special ambiance. The location kicks arse, and they are quick and efficient and deliver a great product.

"I was driving down Kennedy wondering what was I going to eat for dinner, when this placed called out to me as I passed by. Glad I stopped here! Went in and ordered a gyro, and they built it in front of me putting on all the lettuce, tomato, red onion, and cucumber that I could want to accompany a thick stack/layer of beef and lamb. After adding the sauce, they closed it beautifully, and I paid my $6 & change and went on my way. I unwrapped it at my new townhouse and it was delicious! The only complaint is that the last couple bites were dry(just meat and bread) and could have used more sauce, but that may very possibly be my fault for blindly devouring this thing.

Pros: what is not good here...the warm pita with tzatziki, gyro, greek salad, the thin cut potato fries...and Aries beer, comparable to Yuengling but with a slightly hoppier and cleaner finish.

Cons: they close too early",33,C,Louis Pappas Market Cafe,Louis Pappas Market Cafe,L0uis Pappas Market Cafe,5.0,NEGATIVE
"I am not a sushi connoisseur by any stretch, all I know is that when I'm in the mood for ""sush"" I like it fast, tasty, and inexpensive and Ginza delivers resoundingly on all fronts. You walk in, are quickly show your seat, they take your drink order and away you go to the sushi bar where two chefs prepare a constantly replenished selection of sushi ranging from rolls to sashimi. the actual pieces of sushi are scaled down compared to more traditional (and expensive) sushi restaurants so I adopt a strictly 2=1 policy.

"First, it's nice to have a good atmosphere restaurant in the Seminole Heights area. I have no complaints about the decor or the architecture. However, in my one trip there (dinner on a Friday) the service was bad and the prices were high.  

I don't mind paying a premium for excellent cuisine, but this wasn't that great. My seafood pasta was good and a large portion, but it was almost $20. Not worth it. My dinner partner had the fish, salmon. It was dry. 

For service, the waiter, who was very nice, wasn't very good. He hadn't seen the specials board, so when he offered us the soup of the day (split pea) that was no longer available; it was veggie barley. He just wasn't  too quick to process orders either. The fish special came with 2 sides. He said the side were chosen by the cook--the menu specifically said the guest chose the sides. He came back 10 Min later and ask for our sides. 

He also too infrequently refilled our waters and forgot about the teas we ordered. He seemed strangely discombobulated with the table. Maybe it was his first day, but really, I want good competent service especially at these food prices. 

We won't be returning. 

With Ella's opening in the area, we are hoping this will be destination eating in SemHghts. 

Hope this helps.",20,B,Bungalow Bistro,Bungalow Bistro,Bungalow Bistro,2.0,NEGATIVE
"Had a hankering for Chinese and was on  this side of town and thought I'd stop

Ordered the lunch combo of sweet and sour pork with fried rice and wonton soup.  Also ordered an egg roll a'la carte.  Portions are HUGE!! 

The soup had 3 large wontons that were delicious.

The sweet and sour pork surprised me as there were giant chunks of meat, not all doughy breeding that you get at most places.  The fried rice was solid, nothing special.  

The egg roll was delicious, fresh and crispy....as close to perfect as you can get!

"Hate to pull the ""In N Out"" card, but being from CA, the comparison has to be made.  My burger was ok, and I appreciated the topping choices, but they forgot the bbq sauce, and my tomatoes were quite mealy.  The double patty was a nice surprise though.  Unfortunately the meat was a bit bland.  Fries were overflowing for a ""regular,"" would like to see the large (but not order it, can't eat that much).  They weren't all that exciting though.  Somewhere between shoestring (my preference) and steak fries, and on the bland side as well.  The smaller, crispy ones were good, due to the skin on, but on the whole I left a lot due to disinterest.

I had heard a lot of hype about 5 Guys, even people from CA saying it is better than In N Out, but I respectfully disagree.  In N Out is cheaper, and has better fries.  For not having an In N Out for 2000 miles, 5 Guys (in Tampa) is by no means bad, but it's just not all that exciting in the end.

"Where to start? The sandwiches are delicious and huge. I've tried pretty much everything on the menu and I must say the Pastrami is the best I've ever had south of the Mason Dixon line (and possibly north of it too) and the homemade rye bread is perfect with not a bit too much caraway, most people who don't ""like rye bread"" love their homemade slices. Next the staff is very helpful and friendly, of course it's a family run operation so it can get busy during the lunch rush, so first timers may not ""feel the love"" if their first trip is during that time, but come back a couple of times or a little after the rush and you'll soon feel like family there. Oh, and I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that the rotating menu of homemade soups never ever disappoint. 

Whenever I bring friends there, I always recommend the half soup and half sandwich (either the Hot Pastrami or Powerhouse if they need help deciding), unlike other soup/sandwich combos you feel like you're getting a full delicious multi-course meal (especially if you finish it off with an over-sized cookie or cake pop).",1,A,Carrollwood Café & Deli,Carrollwood Café & Deli,C@rrollwood C@fé & Deli,5.0,POSITIVE

"This was my first time time at Genghis Grill and it was awesome! 

The ""deal"":

What makes this place different? You pick all your ingredients, from your protein down to the sauce! If you wanna watch them make it you can probably do that too. Don't freak out if you're not a cook-you don't need to be. Does that one thing look like it may taste good with that other thing...go for it. 

------

You'll take a seat first, you'll have the choice between a small, regular/medium, or large bowl. There really isn't a big difference between the regular or large bowl. The small...is really small. With some creative stacking you can probably fit the large amount in a regular bowl like my one friend did...he made a wall around the bowl with pea pods for maximum stackage..pretty ingenious. After you add all your items you pick what time of rice you want from the sign near the grill (fried, white, etc), leave your bowl and receipt with a staff member and they ask you if you are allergic to anything, then it's given to the grill dude who makes magic with all your ingredients. I""m pretty sure you can stand there and watch them make it, or like move to the side to not be in the way, but we just sat back down as they bring it to you once its done.

The Food:

No matter what you put together it will no doubt come out tasting good. I'm pretty sure there are thousands of combinations you can try and they've tested them all. The items are all fresh and you can obviously see/smell the quality of everything...especially the meat. If you're a germaphobe be aware that the tong handles in the protein section are covered with meat juice. I hate handling chicken so I went straight to the bathroom and washed my hands after finishing my bowl. You may want to bring a napkin up with you for the tong handles. Again, everything was super yummy.


The Service:

Our server was SUPER nice. Our big group of friends joked around with her and she was super sweet about it. She was also very attentive with the drinks and making sure we were doing okay.

The Atmosphere:

Clean, pretty big. There is a barrier to sort of make a line where you wait to make your bowl but it seemed pretty tight. Wish they would knock out that little wall/barrier and just put open stanchions.

"This Dairy Queen is one of the few fast food places that has managed to stay in business in the Citrus Park area.

Sometimes this DQ's food comes out quickly, sometimes it takes forever. Sometimes the food is hot, sometimes it's not.  Sometimes the place is clean, sometimes it's not. In other words - this place is always a crapshoot - but usually it's okay.

I always get the chicken finger strip basket, which comes with four strips, fries, and bread.  The buffalo sauce they provide to dip in is tasty, and when the French fries are hot, they are delicious.

The Lamb Gyro was soo good - wished the onions were freshly chopped with the right amount of tzatziki sauce and tomatoes.

"Had the palomilla steak ($9.99) like 10 minutes ago (12/13/2021.) It literally tasted rancid and my stomach already hurts and we're still in the parking lot. 

I had my husband taste it and he said it tasted weird. This is the 3rd palomilla steak I've had in less than a week, so it's not like I'm just unaware of what this dish tastes like, the meat tasted legitimately rancid.

Side of beans and sweet plantains tasted fine but service was bad too. No water refill until we had already finished eating. 

My Spanish isn't good enough to be able to complain about my dish when the waitress asked my husband something in Spanish when she noticed the steak still on the plate when he said he was done. 

I am going to be so mad if I get sick.

Docked one star because of inconsistency issues. Sometimes my naan is thick with two large pieces. Other times it's thin and cut in four smaller pieces.

I am new to the area...well I don't if that legit I have been here for a year.  Any who I have been scouring the earth in Florida lol for a favorite pizza and wing place sadly this won't be it. Well not favorite status not that I wouldn't come back. So my issue is the pizza maybe had a smear of sauce. It was basically cheese and sauce this can be fixed next time I ask for more sauce.  It was very garlicy I think I read that.  So we got pizza and wings.  I am used to wings being deep fried naked and then while hot rolled in a buffalo wing sauce.  I specifically asked the guy that took my order said yes but it really didn't seem this this was the case. The wings didn't really have much crisp to them.  The sauce they were rolled in was odd. It wasn't a pour liquid like kinda sauce but maybe something dry based. I could be wrong. Again none of these are deal breakers.

"Oooookay, so I know on my tagline it says proud carbivore and glutenarian, so clearly I don't do gluten-free. However, as a dessert enthusiast I do not discriminate and am willing to try anything dessert related. I was also very intrigued to know that their products are vegan as well, and as someone who ""dabbles"" in veganism, I knew I had to give this place a try. I've had the pleasure of trying some of their goods before, such as banana muffins and truffles that Jem's Café carried, and they were very good. The thing about this place is that they're not just gluten-free, their also allergen free of virtually all the common ingredients in food allergies such as eggs, nuts, dairy, as well as wheat and gluten, among others. The past two visits I've paid was for their special ""Allergen Free Dessert Night"" where they had extended hours and special menu items. Thus far, I've had their strawberry hand pie (which is a pop tart basically), their special pineapple cake slice, and two of their orange drop cookies (which is an everyday offering). Although the strawberry tarts were a little pricey (about $8 for two because one is not enough), I really enjoyed it and would order this product again. The crust was perfectly thick and flaky, but soft to chew and the strawberry filling not overly sugary and I could really taste the real fruit in it. It was topped with strawberry frosting and die free sprinkles which gave it a nice touch of childish whimsy. I was only disappointed that all I got was just the two poptarts, so I was ecstatic when they had another Allergen Free dessert night. This time I was in a bit of a predicament because I wasn't sure what to get. Birthday cake cupcakes and brownie sundae or pineapple cake??? (two of their specials). So after going back and forth on what to choose, I decided to go with something different (because I always default to birthday cake) and get the pineapple cake slice. Oh was I glad I picked this! This is probably my favorite item I've gotten from them for a few reasons. First off, if nobody told me, I never would have guessed there were no milk, eggs, or gluten like its traditional counterpart. I half expected the cake to be crumbly and have a somewhat sandy texture as most gluten free items, but for this cake, that was not the case at all.  The cake was very soft and moist as I ran my fork through it. It was a three layer cake that had some pineapple puree holding the layers together. Somehow, the cake was strangely refreshing as pineapple fruit or juice would be, which is normally I would not describe cake. There were no chunks of pineapple as I would have guessed, it was all blended in the cake and puree. It had a light amount of vanilla frosting over it that did balance out the fruity flavor well and the frosting was not overly sweet at all. As a final touch it came with a dye free maraschino cherry which rounded off the cake quite nicely. I plated the cake slice along with two orange drop cookies. The cookies were short bread with a slight hint of citrus, but they were moist and cake like. They were topped with a drop of orange icing. Customer service is outstanding too. The girl behind the counter was nice enough to take two of the orange cookies out of the half dozen box because I REALLY wanted TWO cookies to go with the cake (I'm somewhat OCD about that). The best part was I didn't feel like I was going to slip into a carb and sugar coma by the time I was done and didn't feel sick despite all the sweets I ate. Now, as tasty as these treats are, hopefully everyone remembers that they are a TREAT, not a health food, and should be treated as a TREAT. It is pleasing to know though that for those who suffer from Celiac Disease or Gluten intolerance (as well as strict vegans), that they have outstanding options and don't have to feel like they're missing out. Word of advice when purchasing these treats: if you don't eat them right away, place in the freezer or they will go bad in as little as two days! I know this because I learned the hard way. They are also a little pricey, but it is comparable to any other specialty dessert shop. I look forward to another visit with them.",22,B,Stacy's Gluten Free Goodies,Stacy's Gluten Free Goodies,Stacy's Gluten Free Goodies Inc.,5.0,POSITIVE

"This luxury lane by far had some of the worse food I have ever tasted. It's like the cook took a day off while still being at work. I came here with my family on a Saturday afternoon looking to enjoy a day of good eating and luxury bowling. However, once our food came out every single plate was barely lukewarm. My youngest daughter's macaroni and cheese was cold which started a ripple effect from there. The burger my oldest daughter ordered looked and tasted like it was cooked but sat out for 20-30 minutes before making it to our table. Both chicken sandwiches that my husband and I order were awful, overcooked and cold. My husband will usually finish everything on his plate as he believes firmly in not being wasteful. So it says a lot about the quality of food at this place that he didn't even finish his meal. The sad part about it is that we paid good money for food that should have at least been average especially since they claim to have some of the best fried chicken.

The sushi rolls were good, though mine weren't rolled very tightly and were kind of falling apart.

My complaints: I had the ginger salad and it was literally just lettuce and ginger dressing (no cucumbers or carrots which these salads typically contain).  I also asked for spicy mayo and it had way too much mayonnaise for my liking.  Lastly, the overall atmosphere of this restaurant is really a downer. The restaurant seems a bit unclean, the decor is old and it was so quiet and depressing inside.

I waited for about ten minutes before mentioning that I hadn't gotten the drink.

"To be frank, my rating could be a reflection of expectations not met, as much as it represents important aspects of my dining experience that disappointed. It is important to keep in mind that Bern's considers and promotes itself to be one of the top steakhouses in the Country. By that standard, my experience falls far short. 

The first of two major disappointments relates to the accommodation given to patrons who's dress fell far short of the the restaurant's dress code. Among other things, the Code clearly states that blue jeans are not appropriate and that those wearing such clothing may be seated in the lobby, as opposed to a dining room. However, nearly one half of the people seated in our dining room, and others that were seated in other dining rooms, were wearing jeans. This blatant lack of adherence and enforcement of the dress code diminishes the experience for those patrons who respect the dress code and positions Bern's as a restaurant no more special than Outback Steakhouse. 

Ambiance - here the restaurant earns the highest of ratings. The reception area, though small, conveys opulence. The restaurant is divided into many rooms of various dimensions. Each room is well appointed and elegant. 

Service - both of our servers (dinner and dessert is served separately in different rooms) earned high marks. They were both pleasant and attentive.

Food/Entree- the menu is heavily weighted to steaks. However, there are other options of interest such as rack of lamb. My wife ordered a 6 oz filet and I a 14oz Delmonico (both Medium). The steaks are accompanied by a small bowl of French Onion soup, a house salad, a baked potato and mixed vegetables. The soup, salad, baked potato and veggies were excellent. The steaks? Average, at best. My steak tasted great, but was not tender in the least. In fact, I have had Delmonico/Rib Eyes at chain restaurants that were as good or better. 

Food/Dessert - served on the second floor of the restaurant, the dessert portion of the meal was everything and more of what you might hope for. The individual dining areas, the piped in live music and the desserts all add up to a must do experience. I had the pineapple upside down cake, which was very good. 

If you live in the Tampa area and are looking for a great steak, my recommendation would be Jesse's in Brandon. The ambiance is lacking, but it is a great value and an excellent steak.",13,A,Bern's Steak House,Bern's Steak House,B3rn's St3ak Hous3,3.0,NEGATIVE

Nothing wrong with that. But kind of tough to lighten the mood with the London Symphony and a  boys choir belting out ""NOEL"". Bottom line: I had a drink and went next door in search of a fun vibe.

I was given a sample of sweet potatoes, mushrooms, spicy slices of sausage, in a robust tomato sauce.  It was delicious and I had that for breakfast one AM.

I had been meaning to try this place ever since I saw the long flag thing that businesses use to catch your attention from the street. I'm glad they put that up because I never go into the plaza where the restaurant is located. I had a friend in from out of town so I decided to finally try it. I came in when it was close to their closing time but everyone was still really nice. I ordered fried chicken with mac and cheese and collard greens and a side of yams. While we waited I saw they had banana pudding and I got excited but decided not to be greedy. They overheard me talking and threw in the pudding for free. I enjoyed the food. It wasn't the best I ever tasted but I liked it and would try it again.

I know, I know...Arby's, right? I get it.
Out with the kids and we passed this Arby's, a pretty rare site I must say. This location, although clean, needs a renovation bad. The dining area is just one big area with tables, chairs and a few booths. There are patches in the floor where table support poles used to be. It needs help. The food, well, the food is Arby's Roast Beef, but is it really roast beef or Roast Beast. Put enough Arby sauce on it and you can get it down. 
I have to give kudos to the Manager here and staff. We ordered one kids meal (with two drinks) for them to share. When the food comes it had one squeezy pouch of applesauce. I didn't know what it was so I asked and was told applesauce, much better than fries. I asked how much for another as one wasn't going cut it for two 4 year olds. They just gave me another, no charge...AWESOME. A bonus star just for that.
Speaking of fries they have those silly curly fries here but honestly they were fresh, hot and very good.
All in all a good experience despite the facility.
I saw a man eating a fresh made turkey sandwich on thick sliced bread. It was all dressed up with lettuce, tomato, mayo, it looked good and the guy, who was on his lunch period, devoured it. Just might have to go back and give it a try. After all isn't their slogan ""Arby's has the Meat!""",27,B,Arby's,Arby's,arby's,4.0,NEGATIVE

"Saw this place as we were going to Michael's. It's where the Millers Ale house used to be. Decided to give it a try, as the sign said home made noodles. Th last time I had home made Asian noodles, I was in South Korea. 
The servers were very friendly. The decor is a bit tacky, with the letters ""JC"" displayed about 6 times on chandeliers, light fixtures and wall murals. The dining room is only about 700 sq ft. There are train tracks separating each aisle of booths, which function as a food delivery system for each table. Like I stated, the restaurant is tiny. Not only is the food delivery train unnecessary, the sound is annoying, as it announces, very loudly, to the food recipients when it arrives. Once our food arrived, L7 and a chicken fried rice, I was confused as the noodles were very thin and not what I was expecting. I was expecting the same type of thickness and texture of the handmade noodles I've had in the past, in Korea, Chicago's Chinatown and Paris, Fr. This is not what came to the table. The broth was very flavorful and had a nice heat. The noodles were just okay, but didn't taste homemade. I asked the server about the size of the noodles and she said they were a little thinner than she had seen before, but they never serve noodles as thick as my expectations. 
The most confusing part about our dining experience was the explanation of the pictures on the menu. Each of our servers explained the pictures are not an exact representation of what we were ordering. ???  Why would you print a menu with pictures if it doesn't look like what the guest will receive? I can't begin to imagine the amount of confusion that will come from the decision of printing a menu with pictures that don't match up to the food being served.  Not to mention, the pictures of the noodles on the menu are the thickness I was expecting. 

Not sure if I would go back, as the train announcing its arrival to each and every table was very annoying and the noodles just weren't what I was hoping for.",34,C,JC Noodle House,JC Noodle House,JC Noodl3 Hous3,3.0,NEGATIVE

"I found out about Big Mike's BBQ because my mother is a fan, and I can see why. Big Mike does ribs very home style, like we did at family reunions and backyard BBQ's. He's that friendly guy on the grill who talks to everyone while he's cooking. You can tell he has a passion for BBQ and for ribs, but he has a few kinks he needs to work out before I can give him a higher recommendation. Mike's a great guy and deserves good feedback, so here goes...

------------ - - - - - -
THE DETAILS
Date & Time: Friday, December 28th, 2012 @ 12:30pm
Dining Companions: Solo
What to expect: This is a food trailer in a parking lot next to Jiffy Lube
Server: Big Mike or his wife Charlotte
Liquid: water
Ordered: Pork Ribs (3.5 out of 5 stars) - $10.70 w/collard greens, beans & potato salad
Dislikes: potato salad and repeat visits because food was not available.
Total: $10.70
------------ - - - - - 

Mom says he's known to be very picky about his ribs and spends hours prepping them and removing excess fat. I can totally believe that because my ribs had very little fat.  These are not fall off the bone tender like you find at some BBQ joints. They are tender, but still require a little teeth to bone action to get 'm clean. Many of us BBQ fans prefer it that way.

Where Big Mike's falls short is his way of doing business. I had to come back several times to try to taste his food. He was either out of ribs or they were not ready or he'd closed several hours earlier than his posted time. So on my final attempt, I came early but the ribs were not ready. It was 11:30am (he opens at 11) and he asked me for a little grace and to please come back at 1pm. He explained that he doesn't believe in reheating his ribs and prefers to serve them hot off the rack. He also explained ideally the best way to order is to call several hours ahead and set a time to pick up your order. I get the feeling this business model is going to do more damage than good. People like reliability and want what they want when they want it. 

THE VERDICT
Call ahead to save frustration. I could tell by the flavor he knows what he's doing when it comes to ribs, but these could have used maybe a half hour more grilling time. He likely pulled them off a little early just to avoid having me come back a third time. While the ribs were good, I was not a big fan of the sides, particularly the potato salad. I also didn't like his home made sauce, but lucky for me his ribs really don't need it.  NOTE: The yelp location is wrong. He's about two blocks south of the location on the yelp map and on the opposite side of the street.

Minutes later as requested and they said they didn't get the order. They stated they don't accept Yelp/EatStreet orders online anymore.

This tiny location is hidden away next to the Straz Performing Arts Center. Super friendly staff and they offer a wide range of different coffee drink options which is surprising since the place is so small. They have 1 power outlet and not really a place to sit and work all day but it's great if you are watching a show at the Straz and need your coffee fix. They offer seating outside and no bathrooms. Sitting inside you can hear the show that's performing through the walls which I thought was amusing. They serve Buddy Brew coffee so you can't go wrong with that since it's a local favorite.

"I have only been to a genuine New York diner once in my life, so I'm not fit to be an expert on the subject of diners, but I have been to quite a few in Tampa, so that does give me a little knowledge to draw from.  And my knowledge tells me that this place is great!  If it were as close to my house as Three Coins I would probably never be able to decide which to go to since they are so similar.

Yes, you're not going to get high cuisine when you come to a diner, but that's why that plate full of eggs, hash browns and toast is only $4.25.  You go here for some simple comfort food, or a no fuss breakfast, or just because you want to get out of the house but don't want to spend a lot on food.  Or maybe you just love the 50s style decor and the friendly and competent wait staff.  

Personally, I'm thrilled that my pancakes came out tasting like they contained hints of funnel cake and didn't have that oily coating that a lot of flat top cookeries leave on everything.  I love that my wife's over-medium eggs were genuinely over medium and that our coffee tasted like it wouldn't be served anywhere else but a little diner.

We came here to celebrate a birthday & received excellent attentive service for our large party of 15 VERY hungry patrons. We had no idea what to order so we left it up to the birthday boy to decide. This place totally shocked me! With every dish that came out we were amazed to see how HUGE the portions were! 

and what the heck was in that white sauce? not sure what it was called but we ordered 3 refills of it! it tasted like a delightful combination of garlic butter & cilantro that blended perfectly with the yukka fries! 

We also ordered a bottle of their red wine and no lie was one of the sweetest most tastiest bottles of red wine i have ever had! Everything that we had was simply amazing and i will def be returning here for more.

"This is one of those places that wins you over with great service instead of great taste.   And I mean... truly great service.    We hit Bruh-Mans BBQ first but the ribs were not going to be ready for another house.  Mission seemed to be the closest option so we headed there not knowing what to expect.  It is very clean.. well-organized.. and the staff is just fantastic.  I was offered a smorgasbord of samples so I could make the best choices.  From brisket to pork to turkey... I was offered a bite of everything including the sides.   As I tried to figure out how to get the best value for my money, the staff actually did the math and made recommendations.  And when I explained the various taste buds I was trying to make happy, they pulled together all kinds of sauces and added in a few treats.   

Now this isn't a traditional smokehouse.  The BBQ is cooked in electric ovens.  I had favorites and I had disappointments.  The brisket is the definite winner here.   It is moist and flavorful.  The baby back ribs are quite good and far better than the St Louis ribs.   The pulled pork is good, not great.  I did not like the chicken or the turkey.  The sides are solid.  My girls loved the mac-n-cheese.  The green beans have good flavor and I really loved the cole slaw.  My only grumble... I found the beans too heavy with sauce.   

In the end, this is not great BBQ... but it is solid BBQ... and the people working here are so nice and service oriented, I will go there again.",24,B,Mission BBQ,Mission BBQ,Mission BBQ,4.0,POSITIVE

"Go here if you want to be ignored. Cuban pastry nazi. Zilch. Nada. No guava for you. 

While I have had the guava pastries when someone brought them in to share, and liked them... I personally went there 4 times and never managed to purchase anything. Period. The owner is rude and as I was told by someone who goes there...she would be out of business if it were not be for regulars. 

2 times they were closed during a Saturday during their open hours. A third time during the weekday morning around 830 when there were about 10 on a tray. Sorry they are not available and for others as she gestured towards the people in the corner who were otherwise talking over their coffee and breakfast. Sure. You want to keep them. 

Well when will you have more, I ask. Maybe an hour or later. She has no specific time for us to come back. It was clear we weren't getting any. So we leave. 

One last try today at 9 am and NEVER EVER will I walk into this place again!!! Customers sitting there were nIce saying hi. As I patiently waited and when talking to them said I was here for pastries. She heard the oven ring so they should be out. Asking the owner who finally is available. NOPE.....I get the whole annoyed ... maybe an hour or whenever time story again. Well, I was out of there. Done. Stick a fork in. 

That's fine. I'm not cuban. Maybe I don't fit the standards to being a regular. And I never want to try again to find out. And despite what some have said...I have received better service when I visited Cuba. Nicest people. Oh well!

"The Basics: Ahi Asian Bistro is a Japanese and Thai restaurant located in a strip mall off of Dale Mabry in North Tampa. The restaurant has booths, tables, and a sushi bar. The menu is large and diverse and has options for both sushi and Thai food. I only ordered sushi when I came here and the quality of the sushi was amazing! Definitely a must try!

Things I like: All of the food I had here was of perfect quality and was prepared to perfection. We started with the Crispy Pork Wontons, which were absolutely delicious. The sushi I had included Toro, the Hot Night Roll, White Dragon Roll, and Citros Roll. I thoroughly enjoyed all of these rolls and would highly suggest them. You can tell they use great quality fish and the dishes were all plated beautifully. Additionally, it is important to note, the service here is amazing. Roger, the owner, is so personable and really makes an effort to connect with his customers. The entire staff here is extremely attentive and are all great at what they do. 

Things I didn't like: Nothing! I loved my experience here!

Within no time, I got my order and ran back to the hotel.
I opened the box and that baby was gone in no time. Seriously, I wish I ordered 2 more!

"I hate to give a mediocre review since there's only one other review up here, but c'est la vie. This review is purely for delivery food. I don't know about the physical restaurant, so I can't comment on that. I got a few rolls delivered via Postmates because it was $5 off if you spent $20 from ShoMi, and I also had an extra discount code from Postmates itself. But the rolls themselves are WILDLY overpriced. I know the rent in the Hyde Park/SoHo area is probably exorbitant, but $8 for a California Roll is untenable. Not to mention the specialty rolls that range from $15 to $25 (!!!).

I figured for these Manhattan-level prices in Tampa, maybe there's something special? Eh. The entire meal was alright. Portions were solid--10 pieces for a tempura-fried roll and 8 pieces for each standard roll. The flavors were standard, if not a little underwhelming, but the rolls hit the spot.

Maybe I'd give this spot another chance in the future if they bring their prices down (and actually check out the physical location), but there's a bunch of other sushi joints in the area that don't break the bank.",27,B,Shomi Sushi & Seafood,Shomi Sushi & Seafood,Sh0mi Sushi & Seaf00d,3.0,NEGATIVE

Walked in on ""4th Friday"" 27 April at 10:20pm. The place had changed since the last time I was there, it used to be a craft beer/juice bar. The front used to have a pool table and TV wall, now there is a bar there. I was downtown and decided to stop to get something to drink (non alcoholic). The place was completely lit up, double doors opened with red stools in place. There were red tables out front as well. At the front bar were a few customers and in the back dining area a few more were eating. Since I had to use the bathroom, I proceeded that direction first before ordering. The girl in the front had a sleeve less flannel type shirt, long hair and some tattoos on her arms. She chased me down telling me that the place was closed and that the restrooms were for ""Paying Customers only!"". She escorted me out of the place. As I was writing the review, doors were still open, tables out front and people drinking at the bar/eating in the back. It sure didn't look closed. Due to the rude staff, I decided to write a review and give my money to any other place (Anchor/Fly/Franklin manor) when I'm downtown. 

Their website claim they are open till 11pm during the week and ""late"" on weekends. Yelp had the place listed as closing at 2am. Every place downtown is open during 4th Friday. If you post a review that they don't agree with, expect replies like ""you're a joke"" or changing the story as listed below. Either way it all explains why it was empty and ""closing early"" on 4th Friday.  You can tell by reading the reviews which are true or written by their friends to make it look better.

"I am not a fan of Red Robin.  I'll say that right up front.  I know so many of you are and that's incredibly awesome for you.  I just don't like chain burger joints, especially since I am not a huge burger fan to start with.  

However, I will say this...

Red Robin has the BEST STEAK FRIES EVERRRRRR.  If I was able to just eat a meal of strictly fries, I would be perfectly happy at RR.  The burgers are alright....but I prefer to have a burger at a steakhouse with a better quality of meat.

RR's are also so loud all the time.  I don't mind noisy, but the level of loud in this place is so above the norm.  There just always seems to be the worst children in Tampa Bay come here for dinner, along with their worst parents who do absolutely nothing to get their kids under control.  I have had kids run past my chairs, knocking over my purse, bumping over drinks...even had one kid drop his food in my lap.  Yes, running by with a mouthful and handful of onion rings, he ran right into me and blarrrrgggghhhhh...all the food came out of his mouth and hands, into my lap.

I naturally talked to the parents who just kind of shrugged it off and had junior sit back down.  No apology, nothing.

By the second time the kid ran around our table and knocked my purse down again, I asked the manager to please, talk to the parents and ask them to get their herd under control.  He sure did, by LOUDLY announcing that ""THAT LADY OVER THERE SAID YOUR KID KEEPS RUNNING AROUND..."" etc etc.  Really, Dude?  Now, I am subjected to dirty looks and snarky remarks for the rest of my dinner.  Dinner, mind you, with my wonderfully behaved grandkids who sat in their seats the entire time.  

Red Robin has its place in the universe, I'm sure.  It's an okay place to drop into after a day of shopping at the mall for a meal.  Not exactly a cheap meal...but a meal nevertheless.  I would give RR one star, if it wasn't for the damn fries.  Those frickin' fries.  They call to me in my sleep sometimes...but fortunately, I live far enough away that I have to just lie down til the feeling goes away.",8,A,Red Robin Gourmet Burgers and Brews,Red Robin Gourmet Burgers and Brews,Red Robin Gourmet Burgers and Brews Inc.,2.0,POSITIVE

"I ordered the #2, an Italian sub, 10 inch. The multi grain bread was very good. It was nice and soft and tasted very fresh. The veges were also fresh and tasted good. The meat in the sandwich left something to be desired. The quality just wasn't there. I usually eat sandwiches from Publix, and if you go with Boars Head it is better quality than what was on my sub at Lenny's. I give 3 stars on overall sandwich quality. I got the salt and vinegar chips which were pretty solid. Thick, crunch cut chips with good vinegar taste - 4 stars.

Service: 4 stars. No complaints whatsoever. I was greeted quickly and the staff was very friendly. My sub came out quickly and exactly as I ordered it. 

Overall it's a decent place to get a sub. 3 star rating as it wasn't special but just decent. Better than subway but not quite Wrights Deli.

The buttery crust was delicious and so were the ingredients.
There is only maybe a  couple ounces of protein per pie, though. They could stand to portion a little more chicken in there. At 8.99 for two, it was a good deal. Not so sure if I was getting only one pie for that price.
The mac and cheese was also great. And I loved the toasted Brussels sprouts, even if they were extremely salty. That's what made them tasty.

Don't expect much. It's bare bones but the prices are right. For a natural blowout, it was $40 w/o tip. I'm happy with the quality of the work.  The surroundings can seem sketchy if you're not familiar with east Tampa. There are no food options within walking distance of this location unless you count the people selling fried fish in the parking lot. So, good luck if you're hungry. You can buy snacks in the shop (chips, candy, soda, etc...). There's also a language barrier.

"I have seen so much hype around Chef Tony Macaroni, I knew I needed to take my husband with me to finally try it! My fellow Instagram foodies- fourfoodfreaks, getinmybellytampa and feedingtampabaes were not wrong on this recommendation! An absolute gem of a top tier culinary spot hidden in the Seminole Heights American Legion! Savory Italian dishes just like nonna used to make right here friends!

We started with the fried raviolis, served with Chef Tony's tangy pomodoro sauce and the cheesy garlic bread topped with his hand pulled fresh mozzarella- yes I said fresh made mozzarella!!! That being said, I really needed more of the housemade mozz so I ordered the chicken parmigiana with fettuccine- absolutely divine! Mr. Lombardo (see how I planted the fact we actually know what good Italian food should taste like!) had the macaroni bolognese and lapped it up!! He was a good husband and gave me several roasted garlic cloves he found in his sauce- he knows garlic is my favorite vegetable! It was sweet, buttery and melted in my mouth! I tried his dish and he tried mine and came to the conclusion this was the best Italian food we've had all year ;) Seriously, it was the best we've had in a LONG time! We finished our Italian feast with the cannolis- mama Mia- spectacular! 

I was a bit leary when I saw it tucked in the American Legion but it was honestly super fun and friendly in there! Great music, cheap drinks, casino games and pool!!

"Okay where to start...we walked in and the person working looked almost pissed off that we walked in.  No big deal, I get it, work is a drag and I like to give people the benefit of the doubt.  The menu looked fairly tasty so it didn't bother me.  I ordered the gyros pita, a veggie pita, and a cheese pizza.  Fairly simple right? So I get the food, the gyros wasn't bad, but wasn't great either.  Fairly filling but the meat was lukewarm at best.  My wife's veggie pita was good.  Nothing to complain about there.  My son's cheese ""pizza"" was nothing but a pita and cheese sprinkled on it and melted.  No tomato or pizza sauce.  This is where I start to get irked.  I will say, at least the cheese on there was very generous but I wasn't looking for cheesey bread.  

Now, in the middle of eating, the fire alarm went off and continued to go off for 15 minutes.  Not to the owner or workers fault but a simple "" hey sorry about the noise but there's nothing I can do about the alarm"" would have been nice to hear.  He looked miserable sitting behind the counter on his tablet watching YouTube so I just let it be.  Next, I go to refill my drink and decide to get some iced tea.  The second I start to dispense it, a flurry of fruit flies scatter from the spout.  With no joke, about 5 dead fruit flies in my drink cup now.  That's when I was done. Before I left, I was going to take my son to the restroom but my wife said ""he doesn't need to go"".  After we left, she said she didn't want our son using it. She went in there and No toilet paper, toilet looked dirty, and sink was gross as well.  So yeah, that was my experience.

"Tonight I stopped by Popeye's as they finally have the chicken sandwich back.  This is my 4th time visiting here, none of which I was overly impressed.  However, this was my first time actually ordering the chicken sandwich and them having it.

For me, it's important to remember what the craze is all about.  A fast-food chicken sandwich.  Because of that I feel many reviews will probably, unfairly, treat the sandwich as if it is supposed to be a delicious filet mignon.  For me the sandwich was ready good.  I'm boring...a plain chicken sandwich guy.  Even at Chick-fil-a I order no pickles.  But the sandwich was good.  It was huge, crispy, and tasted fresh.  I've always felt Popeye's chicken lacked a bit of flavor, but their sandwich was better.  Better than CFLA??  I won't say it is...but it's one of the better fast-food chicken sandwiches for sure.

As far as the restaurant itself, I've never been impressed.  There were probably 7-8 cars total in line when I got there.  It was painfully slow.  This has been my experience here in the past as well.  As far as customer service...it's not awful, but it isn't great.  When placing my order it was pouring rain.  There is a canopy, but it's not large enough so I was getting wet.  They asked me my name at the end, which is similar to CFLA.  They are trying to beef up customer service which is a nice thought.  The problem is you can't fake it.  They asked my name only to stumble on the next step and to make me wait in the pouring rain to just simply say, ""ok Mr. Josh pull around.""  It was honestly about 10 seconds between giving my name and getting that response.  I figured I'd be greeted by name at the window, but nope.  The guy literally opened the window and said, ""I'm out of Dr. Pepper.""  That means I gave my name for no reason other than to be asked another question and sit in the rain to hear them confirm they heard me right.  The name thing is fine, but you cant fake it.  My advice to Popeyes would be to be Popeyes and stop trying to be CFLA.  If they do that, they'll be fine and sell a lot of sandwiches and it'll transform their business.  It would also help to now get back in the lab to develop some fries that are actually worth eating.",12,A,Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen,Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen,Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen Inc.,3.0,POSITIVE
"Not another fast food place--but they do have a drive thru. This place is like a guilty pleasure for me: I know I probably should be trying some of the new places in the area, but it's just so GOOD! I don't know what it is, exactly, that makes it so special. Taken alone, no single item is out-of-this-world, but the complete package comes together into something magical. For me, the pièce de résistance is the creamy garlic dippers  sauce. On everything. 

This particular location is almost always completely insanely busy, but they have the staff to handle it--even if they don't always have the parking space (overflow parking on the street). The drive thru line frequently extends around the full building, but they station someone out to take advanced orders, so the wait is never too bad.

I wanted to wait to visit a few more times before I wrote the review but here it goes. I think I found the holy grail of soul food in Tampa. I almost don't want to publish a review for all to see because then the word will get out and everyone will want to visit the place. BUT since someone (Mark P.) put me on I guess I'll share the wealth as well.

The building is unassuming and definitely in a weird location but man, is the food delicious!!! For my first time here I decided to go with Ox Tails, Mac and cheese and yams. Omg! So good! I am almost heartbroken that I have to wait until next Sunday to eat it again!!! The ox tails were perfect; falling off the bone. Mac and cheese was just like my mom makes it (but she makes hers sweet....if you've never had it you must try it). It also came with rice and a brown gravy which was excellent. The cornbread was not sweet and thus I had a difficult time eating it but it was not bad, just not how I normally eat mine. The girl in front of me got the LAST piece of pound cake and my heart sank but I opted for a slice of key lime cake. Next time I will preorder. The wait for oxtails was not very long since its usually prepared in a large batch and just waiting to be plated but other made to order foods will probably be longer.

"Aloha! 

I was thrilled when I learned that Pokē Fish would be opening in the Soho. This was exactly what this side of town has been missing! The first Pokē Fish opened on W. Kennedy Blvd. in the Westshore area last year. I could not be happier this spot opened up in my neighborhood about three weeks ago and knew I had to check it out.

I stopped by recently and was pleasantly surprised at the store aesthetic and my experience. The space was gorgeous and hip, from cool succulent lights to whitewashed shiplap on the walls and a cute outdoor place replete with beds of succulents. Brad, the owner, was working and ran through all the options and also educated me about his natural, sustainable proteins and toppings. As I have mentioned before it shows a lot about a business when the owner is not only present but is working. I appreciated his passion and dedication to his concept and also his commitment to offer better and quality food selections. 

I ended up ordering the large bowl and it was DELICIOUS. The bowl stood no chance against my hungry appetite. The ingredients were extremely flavorful and fresh. I appreciated that the base options are organic as well as their proteins are wild caught or high quality farm raised (the salmon--not fed crap or gassed and dyed). I had Gulf shrimp, yellowfin tuna, and spicy tuna and I could taste the freshness. My mouth is literally watering recounting the meal :) There is also salmon poke, chicken, and organic tofu--so you can have a vegan friendly bowl. You can select your combination of food and toping options for the bowl or they have specialty concoctions.  

There were several fresh drink options (infused water and infused tea) as well as bottled beverages selections, one of which is locally owned Rehab Juice Co. I appreciate the use of local products as well. 

In sum, expect what you pay for at this posh fast casual poke concept. There is parking out front and they are also on Uber Eats which is also linked to the website.

Don't let the exterior fool you. It is a small yet cute (and clean) cafe. I walked in immediately felt welcome.

So good! The empanada itself was tasty but very greasy. The arepa was bomb. It had grilled steak, avocado, queso de mano and garlic sauce. Flavor explosion in my mouth. That arepa is what brought me back the next day! I kid you not. 

I just was in Tampa earlier this week and got a couple arepas (llanera and pabellon) to go along with chicha (some sort of sweetened rice drink). The beef in the pabellon was a tad bit salty but the llanera hit the spot once again.

"Bar Asia is a nice addition to the Tampa food scene.

The restaurant serves up a creative spin on Vietnamese cuisine, traditional Asian classics, and sushi.  

For our starter, we tried the Korean style sweet soy wings.  The sauce was really good and not too sweet, but the wings tasted frozen and were way too big for my liking.

For the main course, we tried the Bahn Mi and Rice Bowl.  Both dishes were really good and full of flavor.  

I also like that they have wine on tap but unfortunately the varietals are limited.

The open kitchen concept is cool.  The restaurant also has an indoor/outdoor bar and it's own parking lot that must be accessed from Cleveland Street.

"I had the opportunity to try their food at the last Flicks 'n Food Trucks event and I was thoroughly impressed. This Italian and Hispanic influenced food truck is serving up some awesome food. My friend tried the Chicken Alfredo Wrap which looked like a chimichanga. It's breaded chicken with a creamy, but not heavy, alfredo sauce wrapped in a flour tortilla and deep fried. Such a simple concept and it's a wonder I haven't seen anything like it before. I also ordered their version of the Arancini, or fried rice ball. It's a deep fried mixture of white rice, ground beef, pepper jack cheese, and mozzarella. The rice was nicely cooked, the ground beef added heartiness, the cheeses were a tasty ""glue"" that held it all together and all encased in a thin, crispy shell.

This food truck is relatively new to the Tampa scene and I have no doubts that they will have a big fan base before long. I can't wait to try some more of their delicious offerings.",23,B,Mobile Munchiez,Mobile Munchiez,Mobile Munchiez Inc.,5.0,POSITIVE

"See my profile for the location of my blog for the full review with pics.


I had a few hours in Tampa and borrowed a crew car.  Not many choices but Viitals popped up on Happy Cow and I was craving a green smoothie in the worst way.  Needed.  Kale.  Now.

I passed it by the first time as it is located on the backside of the ""L"" of a strip mall.  You have to make a right into the parking lot, (or street) and it's on your right.  If you're driving you actually have to look over your right shoulder to see it.  It's there, you just have to look.  You can't miss the sign though.





There is a whole menu board of smoothies and green drinks on the wall behind the counter.  I find it somewhat difficult to make a decision about the slight differences between them as you'll see 2 pictures lower but Evan, (spelled Ivan), helped.  First off though the decision to replace kale with spinach was an easy one as he doesn't carry kale.

I did stop short a few times to look at the vegan cake display.  I had a hard time focusing.  Sugar plum fairies were dancing in my head and sugar spike memories were making me swoon.  They looked so good.  But green was also on my mind and my body.



Ivan making the goodness.  Behind me are about 10 tables.  Someone was working on a laptop so I'm assuming there is internet connectivity.  The place is bright and happy although wasn't busy enough.  Ivan said he was in business for about 6 months so come on TAMPA and support this guy!



Here you can see the different options available.  I just decide what I want, then add what's not included.  I added my spinach to the Ultragreen.  After I read the menu a few times it all sort of blends together.



There are a bunch of different muffins and cupcakes.  I applaud the level of labeling.  Everything is labeled vegan/gluten free/soy free/etc., and most of the items, (I didn't read all the labels), seemed to be vegan.



These two items also caught my eye.  they are ""Meal 'Complete'"" items and according to Ivan, who is a semi-retired competitive body builder, contains the ""correct"" balance of carbs, protein, and fat.  I was saddened to learn that although he tried a vegan diet it didn't work out for him and he now has added animal protein back into his personal diet.  I would have liked to sit down over a beer with him and talk about Brazier and Cheeke and the other bodybuilders who made it work on a vegan diet, to compare what he ate vs what they ate but time was a bit tight and he was, after all, at work.

That being said, I bought one each of the meals.



The green smoothie was thick and rich.  It didn't taste ""grassy"" but had a hint of green garden flavor with the sweetness of the apples balancing it out.  I could have downed three of them.



Here's a bit about Viitals on a laminated card that was on one of the tables.  I wasn't able to read it all there but it says they are mostly a Vegetarian/Vegan place.  I don't know if that means that some of their baked goods contain eggs.  I do know that it says all of their baked goods are made in-house from scratch.  Bravo on having total control over your ingredients.



After I bid Viitals adieu, I started thinking about restocking my cooler bag for the next few meals.  I stopped by a Whole Foods and lo and behold, all the rave, Quorn Vegan Burgers.



I am also in awe of the number of prepared flavored tofu and tempeh options out there.  Also, the variety of garden/veggie burgers.  Someday, when I retire, and I'm really really hungry, I'll do a taste test.



I think Whole Foods, in their existence as a corporation and with their goal of making money firmly centered in their sights, does some really messed up things as far as selling animals is concerned.  I know they are at heart a Supermarket.  I still don't like to see ""Humanely"" raised meat sold there.  I do applaud them for their expansive selection of foods on the opposite end of the spectrum, namely vegan options.  It's almost guaranteed that if it's vegan, (especially local vegan foods), it's going to be in a Whole Foods somewhere.

I also have to applaud Whole Foods because right next to their ""cheese"" events which turn my stomach now are ads for RAW foods and the Engine 2 28 day challenge.  So while catering to those who haven't changed their diets for compassion, health or environmental reasons they still help to put the thought into peoples heads that there are options out there.  If the demand for meat decreases, guess what folks, the size of the butcher counters will shrink.  It's a simple supply and demand.  That's why I think it's a waste of time to champion welfare causes like ""enhanced battery cages"" for chickens or ""humanely raised meat"" for cows.  Just put your efforts into making more vegans!",35,C,Viitals Specialty Bakery & Lifestyle Cafe,Viitals Specialty Bakery & Lifestyle Cafe,Viit@ls Speci@lty B@kery & Lifestyle C@fe,3.0,NEGATIVE

"Why not 5 stars for 5 Guys, you may ask...it just didn't hit the high flavor notes and can be pricey compared to other burger spots. 

What I liked was the fresh beef and a long list of toppings to tailor my burger. The bacon cheeseburger had lots of crispy bacon and was topped with grilled mushrooms, fresh tomatoes, lettuce and condiments. Veggies were fresh. However, the burger lacked the juiciness in a freshly made burger as it seemed a bit of overcooked. Maybe just a bad day as I've had Five Guys in other locations before. Fries were plentiful and well made. I like the plump fries that tasted like real potatoes (sorry McDs). I always like the availability of malt vinegar along with the requisite ketchup that was in either packets or the huge pump bottle with small containers to fill. Soda machine is the now expected smorgasbord of drinks and flavors. 

The location dining area is spacious, a nice feature during our Covid times. Hand sanitizers are wall mounted. Parking was good except for the construction at the end of the lot. 

Lastly, while I was a big fan of Five Guys when they started ...

"My visit to the Filipino Fusion Bar and Grill was the result of a happy accident, and I am delighted that I chose to eat here.

So there I was, innocently minding my own business after some Christmas shopping in the Citrus Park area. I wanted to try something new for dinner, and so I called up my trusty Yelp bookmarks to see what was nearby. My friends Mark & Gigi had told me about a Latin seafood restaurant near the intersection of Sheldon Road and Hillsborough Avenue, and so I set off in search of this place. Come to find out that the Pacific Coast Latin Seafood & Cantina had gone out of business, and in it's place stood a new restaurant advertising Filipino Fusion cuisine.

(You'll find Filipino Fusion restaurant just south of Hillsborough Avenue along Sheldon Road / Memorial Highway. It sits in a corner of the big Home Depot shopping center. Look for the stand-alone white building with the blue roof.)

Filipino food is something new for me. I've tried the cuisine a few times in the past and really enjoyed the flavors, but honestly did not know very much about what to order. Thankfully I have several Filipino friends who kindly pointed me in the right direction whenever I looked cross-eyed at the menu, and as a result I have learned some of the basic dishes and tastes. Filipino Fusion restaurant blends a lot of tastes, and brings a sophisticated type of Pinoy cuisine to the Tampa area. For the record, ""Pinoy"" is a colloquial term for the people from the Philippines, and it is formed by taking the last four letters of the word ""Filipino"" and adding a Y.

Filipino Fusion is divided into two sections -- a bar area with high-top stools and tall tables, and a restaurant area with lots of comfy booths. I was able to take plenty of pictures inside the restaurant, so you'll get a good view of the layout.

The menu is a very nice blend of Filipino and Latin fusion flavors which means that you'll find the traditional lumpia-style eggrolls, stuffed long peppers, chicken sisig lettuce wraps, ceviche, and chorizo burger sliders for some of the appetizer choices. They also serve tacos, quesadillas, and burritos that marry the Asian and Latin flavors in some unique ways -- Pork Tocino, Fried Tofu, Pork or Chicken Sisig, and Lechon Kawali for the fillings as examples. You'll also find Pinoy Cheese Steaks, Longganisa burgers, and chicken Inasal sandwiches.

The entrée menu is a creative offering of upscale Filipino cuisine with the traditional sizzling platters of chicken or pork sisig; deep-fried pork belly; stewed beef; shrimp & pork simmering in coconut milk; and Pinakbet which is a stir-fry dish with squash, okra, long beans, and pork. The chef has also added some seafood specialties including deep-fried whole shrimp marinated in beer; grilled whole squid; and fried whole tilapia.

Since I was feeling adventurous, I started with the Lumpiang Shanghai which were seasoned ground pork eggrolls served with a sweet chili sauce. Very delicious!  For my main course I ordered the Seafood Kare-Kare which was a Cioppino-like seafood stew made with a combination of head-on shrimp, calamari, black mussels and a mix of vegetables including squash, baby bok choy, and long beans, all served in a homemade peanut broth. That came with a side of white rice, and bagoong which is a paste made from fermented fish or shrimp, mixed with salt. It is similar in taste to Asian fish sauce, though not as strong. The peanut sauce by itself is quite mild, so I added in the bagoong and some rice, and was soon spooning the yumminess into my mouth.

Towards the end of the meal, Chef RJ came out to say Hi, and we had a nice visit. It turns out that Filipino Fusion opened last weekend, as the Pacific Coast Seafood place had not been successful. He reworked the menu to incorporate many of his favorite Filipino dishes, but kept much of the interior decorations intact. RJ said that he researches culinary trends in the Philippines and tries to incorporate those flavors into his menu. Lots of exciting ideas for this new restaurant.

On Fridays they hope to have a special pig roast with Filipino beers and fun times. They are already advertising karaoke nights. RJ and his team have some great ideas, and I hope that our local Filipino and Yelp communities will support his business.

"I've been told that The Melting Pot on North Dale Mabry is the original store.  Before they overhauled the interior recently, you would have been easily convinced.  Not that it was dated or ugly. In fact, the old decor offered a lot of wood and dark tones as well as a small wine room.

The recent renovation, however, has brought this particular store into the modern era with lots of hardwood and stonework while also keeping some of the atmosphere from the old store - such as some of the dark wood in the dining room.

As for the experience, it is always pleasant if you're down with fondue.  The duck is the best item- it has a slight orange flavor from a marinade.  We typically use the coq au vin style as it works with meat, fish, an vegetables.  

They have a fairly good drink selection, including wine by the glass. Their  mixed drinks are also pretty good. They recently added some higher-end Bourbons, including Booker's

"Let me start by saying I signed up for Yelp just to leave this review because we had never had an experience like this before. I wonder if the owners even know what goes on in this restaurant & if so how do they remain in business. 

We arrived around 5pm & there was no one in the restaurant. Probably should've been our first clue but we figured people were on their way to evening church or spending it with family since it was a holiday weekend. We Were given the standard chips & salsa in which the salsa was quite bland. Ordered the cheese dip & it was ok. Ordered dinner then visited the restroom & it was an absolute mess (women's was fine but husband said the mens was trashed) quite surprising since there was no one there. They had the typical Mariachi music playing but had turned it off. We told them not o turn it off on our account so it came back on. Then they apparently couldn't find a song to their liking as they continued to start & stop the music. THEN (this is when it got unbelievable) once we received out food the music changed to what one could call gangster rap. The explicit songs that used the ""f"" word & the ""n"" word & specific sexual positions was now being blared over the whole restaurant. When we asked our server who thought the music was appropriate, he was about as clueless as they come. He was at best 17 or 18 & probably in the position to where he had to just do as he was told. Then he said he would have them change it. So the music went back to what one can expect while dining in a Mexican restaurant. When my husband questioned a member at the bar who the DJ was,... a little round guy said he was, so my husband asked why he thought the music was appropriate & his response was ""you didn't like it?""  I'm not sure why or how they thought the music was appropriate but it goes well beyond any boundary of questionable good business & proper customer service. 

By the way the food was ok but certainly not anything spectacular. Only reason we will remember this restaurant is because of the travesty that they assumed was ok.",11,A,Estela's,Estela's,Est3la's,1.0,NEGATIVE

"Arrived the Sunday before Christmas for lunch with my family. The place was empty. It was a little past noon and the weather was nice after a few days of miserable rain. So we asked to sit outside where there were about four tables of patrons to add to the two or three dining inside. The bowling alley wasn't busy either. While we were promptly seated, we waited at our table for minutes on end. No service. Then another family was seated and within a couple of minutes someone was at their table taking their drink orders. Several servers passed us, two even stepped outside to the patio and were talking and looking out at the courtyard. Still no service. We gave it almost three more minutes, on top of the almost ten we were already there, as we watched several servers walk past our table and fail to acknowledge we hadn't yet been helped--no drinks and open menus. So we got up and left. We weren't going to give them a chance. My children wanted to sit down and eat at a restaurant, never mind the cool options to eat at the Wharf. So we wound up at Hooter's, where my seven year old, yes seven year old was able to clearly verbalize how much better the service was there because within a minute of us being seated a server came by for our drink order.

"I thought that I knew all about Peruvian cuisine, but El Rincon Peruano surprised me with the diversity of their food. You'll find this little South American gem in a small strip mall along Armenia Avenue, just north of Waters Avenue in NW Hillsborough County. The restaurant sits in between China Yuan and the Fortune Star Bakery, which is where Coty hosted her recent Asian UYE outing.

El Rincon seems out of place in this mostly Asian restaurant and retail center, but this is the northern end of Armenia Avenue's ""Latin Corridor"", and El Rincon serves up some very authentic Peruvian comfort food which should appeal to everyone. From the outside, El Rincon (""The Corner"") looks like a real hole in the wall, and you probably wouldn't even know this place exists, but trust me when I say that it is worth going inside.

The restaurant is very clean and has about 15 tables, and a large bar area where people sit and wait on their carryout orders. The walls are decorated with very colorful tapestries, ceramics, pictures, and some wall hangings made from llama wool. The customers and staff were all Hispanic, but my server was very friendly after I greeted her in Spanish and ordered some water in her native language. She smiled and easily switched to English for the rest of my meal.

The flavors of Peru come from a wide variety of cultural influences including Spanish, Chinese, Italian, German, Japanese, and African. The three traditional staples of Peruvian cuisine are corn, root vegetables, and chili peppers. The Spanish introduced rice, wheat and grilled meats (beef, pork and chicken), and that all combines with the diversity of seafood available in this South American coastal country. I knew that ceviche would be a specialty of the house as well as grilled meats, but I was anxious to try something different tonight. The menu has about a half dozen different types of ceviche, along with Peruvian soups and salads. There are several vegetarian choices and lots and lots of seafood and grilled meat entrees.

If you want to try the Chinese-influenced dishes, then look for Chaufa which is a Peruvian-style fried rice mixed with your favorite type of meat or seafood, and vegetables. Most of the dinner entrées were in the $10 - 15 range, and the platters of food were huge and meant to be shared.

My waitress recommended that I try one of their house specialties called Jalea, which turned out to be a heaping platter of deep-fried fish filets, shrimp, calamari rings and mussels in the shell, all served with fried Yucca, sliced red onions, diced tomatoes, puffed corn, and some lime wedges. I'm not normally a fan of fried foods, but this was very light in a tempura-style batter, and not at all greasy. This spectacular platter of food could have easily fed two people and a pack of ravenous Cub Scouts, so there was a ton of food to take home. The price was $16.99, and I will easily get three dinners out of this selection.

My meal started with a complimentary dish of fried Wonton strips served with Aji Verde, which is the creamy Peruvian green chili sauce that's made with jalapenos, garlic and cilantro in a light mayonnaise sauce. (Those of you who are regulars at Cuenelli's Rotisserie Chicken will recognize this sauce).

Really delicious, and well worth a visit if you enjoy sampling different types of Latin cuisine. I am anxious to go back and sample the ceviche and the Lomo Saltado.",26,B,El Rincon Peruano,El Rincon Peruano,El Rincon Peru@no,4.0,POSITIVE
"So here is a place that I've been wanting to try for a minute, and I finally got my chance.  Rarely am I both near Kennedy and DM and hungry.  

Upon walking up, I was impressed to see a huge sign out front advertising that they use La Segunda Cuban bread.  I was thinking, ""Wow, not bad considering they're a chain from Jax.""  Well, when I got inside, I was warmly greeted by the staff and my order was quickly taken.  However, after placing my order, I saw a sign claiming they were voted ""Best Cuban.""  I'm just not buying it.  First off, I want to know who the hell voted a chain ""best Cuban"" in a city, not only where the damn sandwich was invented, but that is also chock-full of places that serve up amazing versions of the sandwich.  Seriously folks, let's get a damn grip here.  It was laughable.

So I sit down and out comes our sammiches, and they look great.  I got the Kong turkey deal, and my son got a 12"" turkey and cheese.  The sandwich was good, and I love the fact that they use all of these less damaging cold cuts.  No anti-biotics and all that good stuff, but my son looked over at me after dusting off his sammich and said, ""It was good, but I don't see what's so ""giant"" about these sandwiches and it's definitely not the best I've had. I like Firehouse better.""  He's only 15, but the boy knows sandwiches, and I sadly couldn't help but to agree with him.  In the Jax chain sandwich war, I think Firehouse wins.

After eating, I sat there digesting for a moment, and I saw one of those table top rolodex style advertisement things, so I started flipping thru them, and what I saw shocked, amazed and offended me as a Tampanian (see pic).  It was an ad for their Cuban sandwich, or should type, their ""Cuban sandwich.""  First off, the picture is laughable because it's not even on Cuban bread.  Second, at the bottom, it reads ""straight out of Miami.""  Whoa!  Hold the fugg up, mofos!  Are you serious with that?  You're going to be a CHAIN restaurant, claiming to have been voted best Cuban by someone somewhere and then have the stones to put an add of one on a table in Tampa depicting a sandwich not even on Cuban bread and then top it off with the words ""straight out of Miami""???  I can clearly see that some corporate education is needed up in Jacksonville where they wouldn't know a Cuban sandwich if it slapped them in the face,  I've been there on multiple occasions, trust me.

Anywho, the sandwich was good, but not better than Lenny's across the street, nor Jimmy John's a few miles to the east, so I can't ever see going back.",15,B,Larry's Giant Subs,Larry's Giant Subs,larry's giant subs,2.0,POSITIVE

This is a clear concise example of how employees are a representation of the company. If the owner is willing to allow employees to commit these risky actions then it is a direct reflection on the owner themselves. Using a customers personal information and sharing it on their social media account would lead to automatic removal from a well established company.

"Best Cuban sandwich in Tampa. I say that with care; I was born here in 1951. Every time I come back, I finish off my trip with a stop here. I've never had the breakfast, but the hot lunchs are better than anything you can get in fancy restaurants. I always get a Cuban sandwich for 2nd lunch on the way home. The expressos, Cuban coffee, and Cuban bread are excellent. The hot foods range from fabulous pork ribs that look like dinosaur ribs, soups with fist sized pieces of beef or pork, white rice (arroz blanco) dark rice, black beans, chicken eggplant & peppers (the best) and many other items.  Try the tostones!  Take some home! Prices? A rib plate (2 huge ribs) with chicken eggplant & cooked veggies, a double espresso, a large Zhyperhills  water, and a large Cuban sandwich: $10.90.

"I get all my ingredients for making Pho, Pad Thai, Thai Green Curry, Chicken Tom Yum, Mango Sticky Rice, etc. and ingredients are ridiculously cheap, so what more could you want? Go get shopping, cooking and creative in your kitchen!

My love for this place will never falter. The staff keeps this place fairly clean and are always busy, so it can be a little bit of a challenge to get help. Honestly, this is more of a place where you take care of yourself and requires you to chase someone down if you have a question or two.

You can purchase Pho starter kit for first timers. I prefer putting together my herbs because it's fun to do and I think it's cheaper, too!

I love coming here to get my Pho ingredients (star anise, cinnamon stick, cloves, coriander, fennel, cardimon pod, fish sauce, rock sugar, ginger, scallions, etc.) to make a satisfyingly yummy broth. Also, I'll pickup a couple pounds of beef bones (marrow, knuckle/leg bones/oxtail) for a rich flavor. For toppings, lime (Stable at my house!), cilantro, basil, bean sprouts are a must to complete the dish. I usually buy over 20 ingredients at this Asian market for a comforting, rich beef broth because this can be a one stop shop for making homemade Pho, which saves time! 

I get my glutinous rice along with full fat coconut milk and sugar, toasted sesame seeds or mung beans, from here to make Mango Sticky Rice and make it in a bamboo cone steamer, which they carry!

These are the core ingredients I get: shallot, garlic cloves, stalks fresh lemongrass, shrimp paste, coriander, fresh kaffir lime leaves, fresh galanga (Thai ginger)...this is the basis you need for Thai dishes, especially when I make Chicken Tom Yum and Green Curry, but you would omit lemongrass and add tamarind along with other ingredients for Pad Thai, etc.

You can get your fresh veggies and herbs at a really, really good price point along with ready to eat Vietnamese snacks to choose from, beef knuckles and organ meat as well as fresh seafood and there's even a small meat department.

"I love Westshore Pizza. We order from the office on a frequent basis. Today will be our last time ordering from here. We did delivery which is how we always order. We ordered two phillycheese steaks, 2 orders of wings, 2 orders of fries and 1 order of onion rings. The delivery driver showed up with the order and instead of checking it at the door because we haven't had an issue in the past we took the delivery, paid the money and the driver left. As we began to distribute the food, we noticed one of the phillycheese steaks and one order of wings were missing. We tried to catch the driver but failed to do so. So I called the store and told them what happened. Jimmy the person who took the order advised he would send the driver back with the food that was missing. My coworker then called back and asked them to send fresh fries back with the order so all her food would be cold and she would send back what they left here. At that time, Jimmy hung up on her. She called back again and they placed her on hold without answering. Then a few minutes later Jimmy called back and told me the driver said he came into the office with three bags of food. I explained to Jimmy that what he said was not the truth and that we had cameras on the front door of the office to prove that his driver was not telling the truth. Jimmy then proceeds to tell me ""he finds it suspicious"" that we were asking for extra food. I again explained to Jimmy we were not asking for extra food, just fresh hot food. It is for that reason that I am giving the 1 star rating. The customer service was horrible and left a bad taste in my mouth.

"Walk in, sit down at the bar, ask for a Rye Manhattan, perfect.  Bartender gives me a look, goes to make my drink.  I watch, she comes back, plonks it down, and unceremoniously asks me ""perfect enough?""

A perfect Manhattan simply means 1/2 of dry vermouth, 1/2 of sweet vermouth, all other ingredients the same.  It's not a dick move trying to tell someone they'd better deliver the best Manhattan ever made.

A quick discussion imparts this, and then we're at that ""Oh"" moment.  I shrug, sip my cocktail (it's decent, just not what I wanted and no offer to replace it was made), and pull out my phone for company.  A karaoke DJ begins hauling in equipment, and the bartender shows epic skills in the ""bored, but no way in hell am I going to make eye contact"" moves.

Awesome.  *Sigh*  Two more sips, $20 on the bar under the unfinished drink, and out.  I'll own part of the problem -- shouldn't have ordered a finicky drink to start off with.  But, the place looks like someplace that would know the cocktail, right?

The mango is so fresh!!! They have all kinds of options to add to your mango, but they are all too crazy for me, I like the plain lime juice and salt. They literally squeeze juice out of the limes into your mango, it's not pre juiced or in a bottle.  They also have mango slushees!  If the menu catches you off guard because if you aren't familiar with this it will definitely sound very weird, ask to sample! They let you try before you buy. So yummy, definitely will be getting this all the time now I've discovered it!",31,C,Mr Mango Tampa,Mr Mango Tampa,Mr Mango Tampa Inc.,5.0,POSITIVE
"Have driven by this place countless times but had not gone in due to ""fear of the unknown"". BUT, thanks to my fellow Yelpers and their helpful reviews I went ""All In"".

Franci' s is located in Plantation Center, a small neighborhood, unassuming strip mall. With only 5-1/2 tables, you'd do well to get there early and best the crowd if you plan to find in.

I was craving a Cuban sandwich upon arriving but changed my mind when I saw the selection of the days' hot food items. I wanted chicken and yellow rice, but they don't have yellow rice; only white or morro (white rice mixed with black beans). Well, that wasn't going to work. So, as they serve breakfast all day, I ordered an egg with Swiss on Cuban (no meat) pressed sandwich and a medium café con leché. 

As Boon C. wrote in a previous review, their portions are generous and prices are affordable.  My sandwich, as shown in the photo was warm, crisp and cheesy. 

I plan to return soon for a late lunch or dinner to try the chicken.

I recommend Franco's Cuban Café. Just be sure and save me a seat!",0,A,Franci's Cafe,Franci's Cafe,Franci's Cafe Inc.,4.0,POSITIVE

The sandwiches are big. I 'm not sure what kind of rulers they use at Sulsas but they would do wonders for the self esteem of men across the nation. I ordered the 6 inch and it was clearly closer to 9.

"Zudar's is one of those places that seems like it's been around forever.   The waitress told us the sandwich menu has been around since 1959.  They started in another location.  We came for brunch on a Sunday.  They just recently started opening on Sundays. 

The place was empty at noon.  Not sure if it's because of its recent schedule change.  I usually avoid places that are empty at lunch time.  I mean, how good can they be if they're empty?   Well, let me tell you, they can be good. 

Zudar's is not a fancy place.  It's not divey either.  They've fit almost 130 chairs in a relatively small rectangular establishment with a counter and a small kitchen in one corner. The place is clean and plain.  I usually eat with my eyes first, meaning what I see when I walk in usually influences my opinion. 

Today they had a tomato corn soup and chicken noodle soup.  I came accompanied, so we ordered one of each.  Awesome. Good soup. Very homey taste.  Would definitely order a bowl instead of a cup next time. 

They had quiche specials, but we opted for the omelettes.  I was tempted by the sandwiches, and I will be back for those.  There is no greater compliment I can pay a restaurant than to visit it again.   There are too many option to eat out to waste on bad restaurants.  This is not one of the bad ones. 

Our omelettes were nice and packed with goodness.  Cooked to order just like we wanted them.  The Cuban bread was not that good.  I'm a stickler for good Cuban bread.  I mean, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't Columbia good.  If you are going to sell Cuban bread in Tampa, you gotta be prepared for extra scrutiny. 

I ordered Cuban cheese toast, and I found them a bit stingy with the cheese.  I have to find something to complain about, don't I?

They also offer pancakes, french toast, on egg platters with the usual suspects.  

Service was excellent, although we were the only ones there.  Food took a little longer to get here than I would have liked, but since it's made to order I didn't mind.  If I wanted fast food I would've gone to McDonald's. 

Check out the picture of that carrot cake!

The Sunday menu is limited. I asked to see the regular menu and I noticed a lot more yummy choices. So I need to come back during the week.

So I'm coming back.  I won't hesitate to recommend this place to my friends.",3,A,Zudar's Bourbon St  Bar & Grill,Zudar's Bourbon St  Bar & Grill,Zudar's Bourbon St  Bar & Grill Inc.,4.0,NEGATIVE

The mussels in beer were bitter and a couple were actually bad. The bread served with it was hard enough to use as a weapon.

I had the Korean flatbread on special. There was nothing remotely Korean about it. It has teriyaki chicken and hoison sauce I think.

"I came here with a group as we didn't realize that Cask would be closed for an event. The restaurant for the size was dead. However, it still took 25 minutes to get a round of margaritas (which was their special). We watched two sushi rolls finish, and I believe the manager take them to a table where the customers sent them back. I guess they only ordered one roll not two. He brought back one of the rolls and left the other on the sushi counter. This roll was still there 25 minutes later and was eventually thrown away. There was only 2 people working in the entire bar/dining area. One seemed to the the manager who was walking around in Nike slides, gross. He also seemed very incompetent and the waitress was helping everyone herself. She had to wait on every table, plus bar-tend, plus everyone at the bar. I felt bad for her, but I also felt bad for all the customers as the wait and service was sub par due to her being spread so thin. We then watched as we sat next to the kitchen/sushi chef that two of the rolls we had ordered were just sitting there waiting to be delivered. Due to the waitress being spread so thin and the fact that there was no food runner and the manager having no idea what he was doing we watched as they set there for 5-10 minutes before being delivered to our table. Overall the food once we got it was pretty good.

It used to be a massive 8 page menu, now it's just one page, front and back and organized much better.  However, they got rid of $5 sushi nights, not so pleased about that.  Also, they used to have a lower priced vegetarian mediterranean wrap, now they only have the one that comes with chicken.  You can ask for them to not put chicken, but they won't reduce the price.  This still won't deter us from coming here often, the food is great, and the prices are totally reasonable.  We really like the thai bowl and some of the other rice bowls.  The sriracha aioli is really really good.  If you come during happy hour, you have to at least once try to the nachos special, it's vegetarian and comes with queso, jalapeno's, quacamole and I think something else.  When it arrives, you'll laugh at how much queso they've put on the nachos, so tasty and so worth all those calories.  We actually get full just from the nachos and then usually split an entree.  The pizzas are really good (they even have a gluten free option), but if you're looking for a loaded veggie pizza, this isn't it, they basically sprinkle veggies on the top, and I mean sprinkle, even if you ask for extra veggies, it's not what you'll get at other pizza places.  The happy hour drink specials are also pretty good.

"My boyfriend and I moved down to the Tampa Palms are around two years ago. This is hands down our favorite bar EVER. The food is delicious! We have had their loaded fries (THE BEST), pizza slices ($1.25 on Wednesdays, I believe), burgers, mozzarella sticks, and cheese dip. Never disappointed. 
Drink specials are fantastic. Two for one wells, $1.25 wells on Wednesdays, liquor pitchers, AND during football season you can get a wristband that lets you drink unlimited beer until 7 pm. 
So we pretty much live there on Sunday's since we are huge football fans and love being able to watch multiple games at a time.  This is definitely a JETS bar but they take up the entire lounge on the other side of the bar so don't fear if you aren't a Jets fan. The rest of us sit in the better part of the bar anyway. But it definitely provides a good atmosphere of excitement when they're playing! There's a good mix of fans from all of the other teams, which we love considering we root for the Packers (me) and Pats (him). Only complaint there is that one or two TVs are of lower grainy quality so they should really consider replacing those. 
Servers are usually awesome. Very attentive and efficient. Danielle has been our most regular server and she is ALWAYS on the ball!
They have lots to do besides eating/drinking like foosball, darts, pool, basketball, trivia, and dancing at the lounge. Haven't been dancing there so can't comment on that.

"Ever since I moved to Tampa, I've been addicted to the cuban sandwich. And hidden in the heart of Tampa, rich with competition from surrounding restaurants, Bobby's Sandwich Shop quietly makes one of the best ones I've had here in Tampa! On the surface, a cuban sandwich can seem simple, usually consisting of the same ingredients (cuban bread, ham, pork, cheese, pickles, mustard). What seems to set Bobby's Sandwich Shop apart from others is the freshness of the ingredients.  The bread has a nice toasted crust on the outside and has a soft flaky center. The pork was well seasoned and juicy. The amount of mustard used was just right; it didn't overwhelm the sandwich with flavor or jmake it too soggy. And best of all, it was only $3.50. 

My fiancé got the palomilla steak sandwich, which was also very tasty but we both agreed the cuban was very top notch. 

If you do stop in, do yourself a favor and try their cafe con leche. It was well balanced, with a nutty aftertaste and it wasn't too overly sweet. 

I am definitely a big fan and will return!",4,A,Bobby Sandwich Shop,Bobby Sandwich Shop,Bobby Sandwich Shop,5.0,POSITIVE

"Ommmmmmg if slap yo mama and call me a chicken lover was a person it'll be me! These wings are so meaty, flavorful, and juicy. It literally felt like an orgasm in my mouth.

I learned about this spot thanks to an friend of mine so I made it my mission to give them a try. It's in the same plaza as DD's discount off of Hillsborough. 

What I truly loved about them is that the wings are naked, not breaded. So for my keto or low carb folks this is a guilt free meal for sure. I ordered hot , although, there's a million flavors to choose from.

While you can find pricing online, they have daily specials upon arrival. So that's a perk for sure! Also after you order you can hang out inside until your food is ready as it's kind of a mini convenience store. Think one stop shop and that's exactly what they are at tasty's!

I promise you that you will not want to return to your previous wing spot. I promise you that you will crave think of these wings daily. I promise you that you will not be disappointed.

"I was intrigued by the concept of this Revolution Ice Cream company spin off and have been following it since it was announced.  Glad they are finally open and I got to try it out over the weekend.  The concept is a base flavor of ice cream (chocolate or vanilla) and various mix ins and toppings depending on the size you get.  The options are numerous and can seem overwhelming.  There are a few suggestions written on the wall that are some customer favorites, but it would be helpful to have some staples on the menu to not only speed up the ordering process, but to also help many indecisive souls who venture in.  

On my visit I did a chocolate base, Andes candies, brownie bits, Cafe Bustelo, and a caramel topping.  The ingredients are all thrown into a mixer type machine and then topped with the topping.

They have a very interesting menu where almost every item has something cereal related cooked into it. I really wanted to try a milkshake so I went with the Fraggle Rock shake. It was pretty good and handmade in front of me at the bar. I also got the Apple Jack breakfast burger called ""Hit the Road Jack."" It was very greasy but very delicious! 

My husband got the Fruit Pebble chicken tenders, which he swears are the best tenders he's ever had! It came with what tasted like Catalina dressing on the side, but the tangy sweet mixed with salty was surprisingly delicious!

Their beers were fairly priced and they had a decent draft selection of local crafts and some good imports. The overall atmosphere is very up my alley! It's decked out with 80s cartoons and memrobeilia and they have pinballs machines and large games like connect 4 to play on the tables. I would really like to go back at night.

"I'm guessing that most of y'all know what to expect from Shake Shack. So with that in mind, I'll try to be as brief as *I* can be. But this was my first experience at a Shake Shack, anywhere! 

It was a Friday night, maybe a month or so after Shake Shack opened in Tampa, and hubs was craving a burger. First, were thinking about place near us. But, as we headed out, I remembered that our Shake Shack was open, and so it was decided.

Parking was a challenge, as much of the Midtown area was still a construction site. I didn't realize until later that the garage was open AND adjacent. We stalked a couple of cars in the surface lot next to (or behind?) Shake Shack until someone left. But even for a Friday night, we waited mere minutes for a parking spot.

Inside was another story... it was PACKED. All ordering seemed to be via a row of kiosks against the back wall, although one tablet was out of order, and the queue was rather long. I noticed a cash-only counter but no one was manning that register. All of the tables inside were taken, in spite of the dining area being rather large for a fast food joint.

Eventually it was our turn to order, and navigating the ordering process was fairly simple. We paid right there, and I entered my cell phone number to be texted when our order was ready. Then we went outside to the patio where we found an open table. Our wait was about 15 minutes or so, which seemed reasonable for any time of day.

I'd ordered the Shack Burger, because I wanted to start with a staple for my first visit. This was a great burger, and I ate every bite! I also ordered crinkle cut fries, and loved those as well. And since Shake Shack is also known for their milkshakes, I had to try one! I veered from a classic, though, with the Cherry Pop Shake, and I was not disappointed.

Logan's used to be my favorite mid-range steak joint. Not any more. The last 3 times I've gone the steak has been pretty disappointing. Twice they way over cooked my steak, then brought it out basically purple in the center when they made me a new one. Medium rare is not cold and purple in the center. I chalked it up to ""maybe they just forgot how to cook a good NY strip"".

The last time my husband and i visited, I ordered the ribeye, which is my husbands regular order. He's never been disappointed in his steak, so maybe I should try that! Well, we both ended up disappointed. It was cooked to the proper temperature & seasoned well, but man was it tough!

I honestly think they must have changed meat vendors, because the NY strips are much thinner than they used to be (thus, harder to cook well) and the ribeye is much more tough than it used to be!

Located in the food court of International Plaza near Chipotle, Johnny Rockets is a walk-up and order style counter serving up burgers, fries, and a handful of other items (probably a bit more limited than what you might find at an actual Johnny Rockets restaurant).   

I had the Rocket Single which came with cheese and NO condiments. They will provide ketchup packets as well as mayo packets but I was told that they do not have mustard (which may have just been on that particular day, but a bit off-putting none-the-less). The fries were just so-so; I didn't even finish them and I ALWAYS finish my fries within minutes.

I saw what appeared to be a crowd of people waiting for their orders, so I became worried that it might take a while for mine. When I asked how long it would be before my order was ready, the employee said probably about 5-10 minutes.

My friend mention that they have awesome combo deals, I logged into DoorDash and browsed the menu.  I was trying to remember what flavor of wings to get because my friend told me all of the flavors were actually great but her favorite was the honey sriracha flavor.  I decided on honey sriracha wings and shrimp fried rice. The price was a steal $8.99 for a good portion of food.

About 20 minutes later the food arrived really piping hot, which I appreciated that.  I tasted the wings and they were messy and tasted great! Hey I'm eating inside my house so who really cares if I had to keep the paper towels near by!

The food came out really quick it was hot and fresh. The one draw back was none of the veggies were without meat. I don't mind it but my sister didn't and was to busy picking out the pork from the collards.

I came across TNT Burger on Yelp and even though they did not have any reviews, quite frankly, they didn't need any. There were a couple of photos that intrigued me and got me to look on social media for more. On Facebook I found the most ridiculous looking burgers and fries that you'll ever see. I knew that I would soon need to visit, but also that I would need to literally go on a 5 mile walk beforehand to prepare my body for the destruction I was about to willingly cause against myself.

The decision of which burger to order was a tough one, as they all sounded appealing. I ultimately landed on the Colombian burger, but am already excited to try some of the others.

The burger was definitely tasty, but as you would expect, as a bit overwhelming. It comes with an angus beef patty, sauteed onions, shredded chicken breast, sweet plantains, cream cheese, bacon, chips, pink sauce, lettuce and tomato on a brioche bun. Each bite tasted different because it literally was a different meal depending on where I bit.

Speaking of different meals, the Rock'n'Fries. It's funny that these are even called ""fries"". This closest thing I can compare it to are the Loaded Cheese Fries from Outback, but I think this actually outdoes Outback's version.

Here's the menu description: French Fries, Hot Dog Sausages, Onion Rings, Fiesta Cheese, Crispy Bacon, Chicken Tenders, TNT Sauce, Ketchup and Mustard. My God.

This ended up being the star of the show for me. Like the burger, I heavily debated going with these or the TNT Fries, which are almost the same, but have corn, shredded chicken breast and mozzarella cheese instead of onion rings. Just typing this caused me to gain a pound.

I really love to see how much this entire food truck park has evolved. A few of the trucks have really turned their spots into the closest thing possible to an actual restaurant without having four walls up. Giant tents and several interior tables and chairs are a part of several of these trucks, including TNT Burger. They also had music videos playing, which gave off a lively atmosphere on a Sunday night. 

Again, I look forward to returning and trying some more burger options. But I really should only eat here when I am able to fully accept the consequences of the scale the next morning. This place is not for the faint of heart... nor is it good for the heart. But for the belly? It's heaven.",22,B,Tnt burger,Tnt burger,Tntburger,5.0,POSITIVE
"After nearly a year of walking by this place, but never quite being hungry enough to eat here, I finally gave it a try last night.

My parents are from Chicago originally, and often complain about the lack of ""Chicago-style"" food here in Tampa. To those who aren't familiar with Chicago-style food, it basically consists of hearty servings of  (usually) boiled meat piled on top of bread. And lots of fried stuff. Basically, it's heaven.

The restaurant is endearing and reminds me a lot of the small hot dog stands that can be found in my parents hometown. You order at the window, take a seat on the patio, and your order is brought out to you. At each table there are rolls of paper towels, and you will soon realize why it's necessary to have endless napkins at your disposal.

We split a basket combo, and I realize you might be wondering ""Why did you SPLIT a combo? What are you, an old married couple on a budget??"". But consider this: We ordered a foot-long Chicago Dog (which is boiled, topped with onions, relish, pickles, peppers, and cucumbers) a soda, and a HUGE basket of either fries or tater tots. The hot dog was AWESOME. It's been years since I've had a legit Chicago dog and this did not disappoint. The mustard was dripping down my fingers and chin, the hot dog was flavorful, and the peppers on it were awesome. The plentiful tater tots were both hot and crispy, and by the time we were done, I was pleasantly full.

The menu here holds a bunch of undiscovered treasures and I can't wait to be back to try the Italian Beefs. 

They're open till midnight on Thursdays, and 3am on both Friday and Saturday, which is something I'm happy to have discovered. Finally, an alternative to late-night pizza!",18,B,Hot Willy's,Hot Willy's,H0t Willy's,5.0,POSITIVE
"We were near the mall and decided to pop in for a 'light' lunch (New Year's Resolutions and everything).

We were seated right away and the hostess was awesome, she asked if we had been there before and RAVED about the menu and how much it impacted her decision to take a job there.

She showed us to a booth and within minutes Brittany came over, introduced herself, took our drink orders and told us about a few additions to the menu.

Being completely honest, I was more than a little concerned when I saw the prices on some of the lunch dishes. But, I also so most Yelp comments talking about a little pricey​ but worth it and I have to agree.

My husband ordered a Wok Out Bowl - Chicken ($16.00) with Sweet & Spicy Thai sauce and sticky​ brown rice. He doesn't like mushrooms so they offered to do extra​ broccoli instead.

I went with the Cajun Shrimp Tacos ($14.00) I got a platter of the three nice size tacos and I chose slaw as my side. The tortillas were fresh, warm and really well made. The mango slaw was a nice balance of crunchy, sweet and savory and the chopped peanuts added a lot of crunch. There was a decent amount of spicy shrimp pieces and that balanced the dish perfectly. The slaw was pretty awesome, it was light fresh and crisp with lots of flavor; I'd love to make that at​ home!

Nice size portions of light, fresh, well-prepared​ food, awesome service ABSOLUTELY made the cost worth it.

I'd go back again!

"As a disclaimer - I just came back from a two week trip to Italy: including Florence, Rome, lake como, positano and Venice.... so Italian food and pasta will never be the same in the states! 

With that being said and expectations put aside - I would give osteria about a 3.5. We started with the octopus and puff pastry appetizers which were very good. The octopus had this nice smoky flavor and gentle red tomato sauce with a kick at the end. 
The puffy pastry dish is very unique and the pastries were very light and delicious. I would say, I would have enjoyed it more if the pastries were tiny bite size pieces where I could eat everything in one bite instead of having to cut it.

For drinks i got the osteria spritz - i loved the drink. I loved aperol spritz in Italy and so glad i found a nice version to it here.

Entrees I feel was where it fell short. Entrees ranged from $25-30(?) and were tiny portions. Both pastas were al dente, which was a good first sign. 

My seafood linguine was $29 and i had about 2 clams, 3 pieces of rock shrimp (not the whole pieces but chopped up pieces), 4 slithered up calamari rings and 5-6 mussels. I get that sea food dishes are more expensive usually but.... at least give me some more mussels - they are probably the cheapest seafood item in a supermarket. The sauce was good but nothing special. Underwhelming unfortunately 

The short rib pappardelle was lack luster. It was good but nothing special. There were only 2 pieces of short rib in the whole dish......again, why are you charging an arm and a leg without serving something that is worth while and worth the money to come back to....

The white chocolate tiramisu was amazing. That would be a must get!

Service by our waitress and other staff was great. Timely attentive and they explained everything. 

Lastly ...to knock osteria down half a star - valet accidentally left someone else's key in our car. We were almost home (good thing we live somewhat close) and had to turn back around to return it. The guys were super thankful but should have given us a refund for our valet. The purpose of valet service is for convenience and that was not convenient or professional.

Overall I might come back... but there are better options out there in Tampa. It's cool and a trendy spot to be and have a nibble ... not so sure yet if it's a special place where I would add to ""must go"" in Tampa.",10,A,Osteria Bar & Kitchen,Osteria Bar & Kitchen,Osteri@ B@r & Kitchen,3.0,POSITIVE

Hot is bearable... mango habanero is REALLY tasty and one of my favorites but it's so hot that it's painful as I am eating it... but so good that I can't force myself to stop. Past that, I have tried the wild and blazin' flavors and they are SUPER painful. Can't eat more than 1 wing at a time, and when I do, my mouth burns for awhile after and everything that I eat afterwards tastes extremely spicy. 

The BDubs in Ybor has tons of huge TVs everywhere -- great for watching sports! Also, good service... I couldn't decide which flavor I wanted (you can split your order, but you have to get a minimum of 5 wings of each flavor), so she brought out a bunch of different sauces for me to sample!

"Pros:

Fresh ingredients from the fish to the veggies.

Very good customer service. The 2 workers were helpful and checked on me during the meal. They were even cleaning the tables during  busy times.


Cons:

There is not enough rice in the bowl and they don't mix the sauce with the rice by fork like U Poke Spot. My bowl had large clumps of rice without sauce and taste.

The Spicy Tuna was too finely cut and ""mushy"". Other places have the fish as distinct pieces. It reminded of the Spicy Tuna roll at the nearby Sushi Cafe. No bueno.

Only 1 sauce is allowed per bowl. 

A 3 protein custom rice bowl is $16. Compared that to U poke at $13.50, it seems a bit much. This is New Tampa - a more affluent area so I understand prices will be a bit higher.  However, Fresh Kitchen is only a few feet from Poke Island and I can get a large amount of food for $10-14 and feel satisfied. I was still hungry after eating at Poke Island.

I'm always on the market for new dessert shops and after perusing the menu of all the delicious sounding sweets they had, I dropped by to grab two items that caught my attention: their hot chocolate bourbon cake and the chocolate praline pastry. The cake slice is rather MASSIVE, dense in feeling and very big on flavor, screaming decadence. Its an airy chocolate layer cake with bourbon buttercream iced between the layers (and i can definitely taste the bourbon!) with a thin layer of chocolate in between as if the cake itself already wasn't indulgent enough! Next i had the chocolate praline: it was a chocolate shell filled with an an airy chocolate mousse inside and crunchy praline nibs in the bottom. Delicious. They offer a huge assortment of baked goods and coffee products in addition, which i am stoked and eager to try in the not so distant future. Each dessert was fairly pricey (the cake was $15, praline $12 respectively) but considering the massive size of each piece and the high end ingredients, its well worth it! Tampa is certainly lucky to have a sleek, beautiful dessert shop like this!",38,C,Sucre Table,Sucre Table,Sucr3 Tabl3,5.0,POSITIVE
"I had picked up a Cuban sandwich at a nearby location, another restaurant altogether, and I needed a really good coffee to complement this gourmet experience. Having a long relationship with Buddy Brew, and being close by, I had to stop by and check out this location in downtown. And what can I say? Awesome, state of the art facility, gorgeous architecture and design in the middle of a very modern downtown area. There are nice sleek sofas that match the long minimalist coffee bar and the coffee house is very quiet. Loved the Zen in this amazing space.

I've been following Buddy Brew for quite a while, I think at one point they had a Buddy Brew truck that drove around Tampa and sold coffee. I have also visited several of their locations, including the one in Sarasota/Bradenton. It all started for me when they gave me a free bag of coffee. What a freebie can do for your business is unimaginable. A few years later, Buddy Brew is one of my favorite coffee houses in Florida and the USA. They are definitively one of the top roasters in the nation.",4,A,Buddy Brew Coffee - Park Tower,Buddy Brew Coffee - Park Tower,Buddy Brew C0ffee - Park T0wer,5.0,POSITIVE

The bowls are SO heavy on the rice and the veggies seem like an after thought. The tofu was tiny, small cubes. Price $11.85 or so, that is not a good value. 2nd time I ordered at 1pm, after I placed my order the helper told me ""this will take 10-15 min"", I was shocked, so I set my timer and ran to Publix for groceries. Got back and one of the guys said ""your order has been up for quite sometime"" ahhh!! Don't mind it was not super hot, but do mind the mixed messages.

I know that I could get oatmilk with my drink because I just ordered that a few days ago with a different person at the cashier.  I found it very rude that she was dismissing my request given that I told her I have food allergy.  And then what's worse is that she started asking me how my food allergy works and asked me why I'm fine with the bread but not with milk powder in the drinks.

Another place I can't believe I never reviewed. When I lived in Ybor, Channelside, and then Ybor again - this was my Publix, and I miss it severely. 

Publix is awesome, we all know that. But this Publix has everything you could ever want. And it's absolutely home to the most attractive people in Tampa. Forget MacDinton's or Tribeca... if I were a modeling agent, I would sit outside at the picnic tables eating sushi, and passing out my business card. I just stopped in here the other night, and nothing has changed. Beautiful people everywhere buying food... which makes for non-boring grocery shopping. 

Seriously, modeling agencies of TB - you're stupid not to do this.

An entree of chicken Marsala without the chicken, just mushrooms 4) When we informed the manager her response was ""What do you want me to do about it, we are busy?""  5) It took another 45 minutes just to get the checks for the little food we did eat.  2 hours later still hungry and very disappointed.",11,A,Gallery Eclectic Bistro,Gallery Eclectic Bistro,Gallery Eclectic Bistr0,1.0,NEGATIVE
"I have only positive things to say about this hotel; the location, staff, rooms and accommodations. I've stayed at this Embassy years ago and it looks like it has had a fairly recent remodel. The rooms were very clean and furniture looked new. 
There is a pool and gym on the 3rd floor, the pool is outside but it is heated! 
It's right in downtown Tampa, walking distance to the convention center, the aquarium, restaurants and bars. 
The rooms are large complete with a mini kitchen & living room area with seperate bedroom. 
I think the best features of the hotel was the complimentary open bar every night from 5:30pm-7:30pm and free breakfast in the morning until 10:30. 
There is an additional fee for valet parking, $24 a night but that is pretty standard for hotels in the city.

"Had the breakfast buffet while staying here at the Grand Hyatt Tampa Bay. I thought the service was a bit spotty with three different servers touching base at our table and giving is no clue as to who would bring our check!  Apparently, they had no clue either as we had to flag one down to request the bill...which was delivered by someone else  Very confusing!!!

The pricey breakfast buffet was decent although even though it supposedly offered omelettes from the kitchen, no one was available or ever asked if we wanted to order one.  There was no one stationed at the buffet to make the omelettes as I've become accustomed to expect. So...short on time to get to our early Tee-time, we settled for the scrambled eggs at the buffet bar. 

For such a nice Hyatt property, it was disappointing to see such confusion in the breakfast cafe.  We'll breakfast outside the hotel for the rest of our visit. Two stars is all you earned.",37,C,1823 Kitchen & Bar,1823 Kitchen & Bar,1823 Kitchen & Bar,2.0,NEGATIVE
I decided to go for all you can eat ribs because I had always enjoyed my meals there before. I had to wait a long time for my dinner to come out with 5 ribs on the plate. The ribs were cold. I ordered more ribs and when they came out there was very little meat on them. There were three much smaller ribs than my first order and were mostly fat. They were also cold. I asked the waitress if she could bring me some warm ribs and after a wait she brought another plate of three. Cold and fatty again. I have had good meals there before and maybe with the all you can eat the kitchen was overwhelmed.

I almost always get a taro or a honeydew slush. Luckily today I went with my Husband and we both got my favorites, see pics. They also sell mochi, macarons and I believe, loose tea. I miss the days when they sold snacks like spring rolls but they said they didn't receive enough sales from them. 

If you like boba, tea, sweet treats, etc I truly don't think you can go wrong by stopping into Bobacup. They even sell splut flavor cups if you can't decide! Or reusable glass cups that get you a free add-on like boba, bursting boba, fruit gel, etc.",37,C,TeaStori,TeaStori,TeaStori,5.0,POSITIVE

The only reason it gets 2-stars is because the Greek salad that comes with the chicken skewer was excellent.  The chicken-lemon rice soup was also tasty.

"Great selection of food with a beautiful view.

Whoever chose the businesses that got to occupy the spots at Sparkman Wharf did a great job. In my opinion, there isn't a dud in the bunch. I love that none of them are huge chains and they are all Tampa locals. There is also a great variety of food choices so everyone can find something. 

We went at a kind of random time on a weekday, but since school was out there were tons of families just chilling. I would be more wary about going here when it is hot, but I'm not going to speculate on that without experiencing it first hand. 

There is a ton of seating. Almost all of it was taken, but the grass looks like a nice place to pop a squat and enjoy some food. My husband went for tacos and I went with an acai bowl. The acai bowl was on par in terms of cost about what I pay at a normal brick and mortar store. The tacos were on the more expensive side, so I don't feel like I can say that you'll pay a premium here until I experience more vendors. 

I love being right on the water. It's nice to stand and look out. 

We didn't have to deal with parking since we are Aquarium members. That's another positive to Sparkman Wharf. You can walk to so many places! We walked to the Aquarium and we also went to walk the Riverwalk a bit. It is so centrally located to a lot of fun happenings.

What's nice about this market is that shops line it too; on a hot day you can explore a few booths, hop into a coffee shop to cool down, check out a few more booths, wander into a clothing store, etc. This market had food vendors that you could get lunch from or you can get ingredients for dinner like meat, eggs, tons of produce, fresh herbs, & so much more. It was just a truly great experience & parking was free in the garage too!

Second time with family, we got special attention from the apparent owner/boss.......and that was far worse.  He seems to fancy himself as a charming raconteur; he is in fact an intrusive, bossy, crude jerk.....even dropping a few racist comments about other guests.   This guy could give the old National Socialists a bad name.  We finished quick, skipped dessert, downed our drinks and got out before lightning struck and we became collateral damage.  For a fine German food experience and nice human service, try German Bistro.....even if it required you to venture deep into South Tampa.",24,B,Schnitzelhaus Restaurant,Schnitzelhaus Restaurant,Schnitz3lhaus R3staurant,1.0,NEGATIVE

"Southern Seafood recently changed owners.  The previous co-owner currently owns a seafood restaurant in Hudson, FL, and apparently he catches much of the fresh fish utilized in that restaurant. Supposedly he will still be providing Southern Seafood with fresh fish too.  For seafood he can't provide, the new owner intends to only utilize local Florida companies.

It's a small place, with the cold case of fresh fish you see first thing upon entering. Further back, there is a lunch counter set up with 5 stools that face the check out register and cooking grill.  Sodas and water are in a cold freezer up front, and you grab what you want.  Different seafood sauces and seasonings are offered for sale in shelves along the wall.  The menu was small, which I actually appreciated - do a few things, and do them well.

We both had the Grouper Reuben sandwich with french fries (they were out of hush puppies, and the only other option was slaw).  I had my grouper lightly blackened and my companion had his Cajun-style.  I loved being able to see the cook cut the fresh piece of Gag grouper and season it right in front of me before it was put on the flattop.  Fries, too, were dropped while we were waiting, and when they came out, they were sprinkled with Old Bay.  Both the sandwich, and the fries, were delicious.

The cashier (who was one of the previous co-owners filling in) was so kind and friendly.  She gave us a sample of the mahi-mahi fish spread they currently had available - and it was amazing!  It had actual pieces of mahi-mahi in it, instead of being blended down to mush.  Really flavorful, and worth a trip just for that.

It's definitely more of a fun night out here more than a date night kind of place in my opinion, so we'll keep this little gem around when we want to go hang with friends AND get great food.

Always flavorful and able to be customized according to personal preferences, the entrees are on my favorites list for breakfast or first meal of the day. Brittany, our server, was quite attentive and was prompt with our requests. Parking is never and issue and if you go on weekdays there usually isn't a wait. They have two high top tables available for seating in the front to the right of the restaurant by the blackboard where they advertise the specials and features menu items.  If there aren't any regular tables or booths readily available you can seat yourself at one of these without the wait. The tables themselves are pretty spacious and you receive the regular service there.

"I believe this may be the original Outback Steakhouse. I think that Outback is to blame for my Steak Addiction. I got hooked before I was old enough to drive. Now, more than 15 years later, I still love that juicy steak like it was the first time I tasted it. Instinctively, I always go with Victoria's Filet, a Loaded Baked Potato, and a Caesar Salad. I usually get a Fosters, Australian for beer, to wash it down. And when I am feeling extra greedy, I will start off with a Bloomin' Onion. But if you do that be careful, those Bloomin' Onions have been known to ruin an appetite or two.

I have been to this location a few times. The staff have always been professional and friendly. I have never had any problems. The food is usually speedy. I have dined at the bar and in a booth, service is good at both. The only complaint that I have is the parking lot. It is not large enough for the crowd. Luckily, it probably keeps the wait times inside to a minimum. 

If you love steaks and you are stuck up about them, then Outback's chain steakhouse menu may not make you super thrilled. But if you love steak and can put up with the chain vibe, then you should really like Outback. It is my favorite chain steakhouse.

I do feel some dishes have prices that are a tad high for what you get, i.e. they have a small breakfast egg sandwich with bacon and it costs about $6.50.

Our experience was positive - the waitress completely pleasant. She said she actually works at Jalapeno as side-work, just because she loves the food and people so much. Awesome.

Many of their ingredients are from local farmers markets. Everything tastes fresh - I really loved their tortilla chips and salsa - and I'm really picky with my tortilla chips. Throughout our meal - we decide that the tacos were superior to the burrito ""wraps"", and despite the fact that I wasn't a huge fan of the beans I was served, I still wanted to give it another go because the overall impression of the place is positive and the owner which I later met was a very nice guy.

Then today I found out sad news that just after passing their one year mark Jalapeno is closing it's doors on Saturday, September 22nd due to financial crunches in their first year (wish I would have known sooner).

PANCIT - Not as good as home-cooked, but very much acceptable for anyone who has a hankerin'.  Portion was huge and big enough for two.

"Okay...I'm from ATL and I know I can't compare the nightclubs in Tampa to those at home, but I've even had better nightclub experiences in Jacksonville, FL. I came here tonight and it was pretty lame to me. The bartender service sucks. I ordered a drink and it took over 20 mins. The bartender kept telling me she was new, but how hard is it to pour a Ciroc and sprite? I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone from a big or happening city. This was a big disappointment. The only good thing is that you can walk out and come back in. Luckily I had my own vodka in the trunk and made my own cocktail in the parking lot, drank that, and then went back inside to get my $10 worth.

"I'm seldom in this part of town, but some friends wanted to meet here for lunch. You wouldn't expect it simply driving by, but this place has surprisingly awesome seafood. They have some of the best crawfish that I've had in a long time. We ordered them spicy and they were tender with a great balance of heat to the different Cajun spices. We also ordered jambalaya and fried basket. The jambalaya was decent, but the basket was fried perfection. The fried baskets come with cole slaw, fries and hush puppies. You can pick 2 or 3 items from the list. We got catfish filets, frog legs, and gator. Everything had great flavor and freshness.

Side note- There's a minimum order of 2 lbs when ordering crawfish. One person can easily throw back 2 lbs of crawfish if that's the only thing they're eating. There were 5 of us so we ordered 5 lbs along with the other food we ordered and everyone had plenty to eat.

Overall, both the service and food were great. The prices are also very reasonable for seafood. Needless to say, this is my new go-to spot for seafood.",10,A,Crazy Cajun,Crazy Cajun,Crazy Cajun,4.0,POSITIVE

"Bottom lineup front: the Bake has great food and a reputation for terrible service. 

The Bake has outstanding food and a great decor, but the service is very poor. The pizza is very good and they have a great menu to pick from with a beautiful case of cakes and sweets. 

Unfortunately the service is aloof and sluggish at best and downright rude at other times. I recently went in to pick up a pizza for take out, walked up to the takeout counter, and informed the woman at the counter said ""you're gonna have to wait a minute"". After which she filled up a bowl with water and took it to a dog outside. Then she refused a creative loafing coupon saying it was for dine in only (it wasn't) and my pizza wasn't ready (it took 45 min, not 25 like they told me on the phone). Finally they bring out my pizza...and give it to someone else. When I jump in to correct the mistake, they made me wait while they rolled another dough. More rudeness I will not touch on here, but those were a few of the highlights.",14,B,The Bake,The Bake,The Be,3.0,NEGATIVE
"Complete waste of time and money for refused service. This restaurant is apart of grubhub and claims to be open late. There is no disclaimer in their website about refused service and they are all to willing to take your money. The manager stated on the phone that he wasn't going to deliver to MacDill AFB because there was too much red tape. It didn't matter that I could call the gate and alert then that they were coming and then the process would've sped up. 

The manager then proceeded to scold me for placing the order and as every base is different I informed him in was on temporary duty here so his claim that I should have known was invalid and he refused to cancel the order and refund me and abruptly hung up in my face. I was forced to call Grubhub and alerted them of the situation. Their solution was a refund in 3 to 5 days which is utterly ridiculous and a $10 credit for my next order. 

I'm not in the habit of wasting over $45 dollars for services that were refused. It's not that they cannot deliver the restaurant refused. Rheybshouks add that disclaimer to their website. I'm not letting this go and no one should order from this terrible restaurant.

"We dined there a few hours ago on a busy Saturday night, and everything was fantastic.   I used the NoWait to avoid the long wait, and it worked perfectly.  We arrived just as our table was ready, and we were immediately seated.  Our friendly server arrived within a few minutes of us being seated, and our drinks arrived shortly thereafter.   It took about 15-20 minutes for our food to arrive, which considering it was a packed house on a Saturday night, is nothing to complain about.   My wife is vegetarian, and she was very happy with her veggie burger.   My daughter loved her Salisbury Steak, and my boys and I devoured our delicious Burger POX and seasoned fries.   My burger was perfect -- high quality meat cooked just right, soft bun, tasty sauce, and just the right size - not too big or too small.  The vanilla and chocolate shakes topped our meal off just right.  I only wish I left enough room for the pie.  Next time!    Everyone who worked there was friendly, and the manager, Keith, came over to check on us a few times to make sure we were happy.   It was a delightful evening, and we all left happy.

If I could give zero stars I would... after walking around in circles I had to call the place to see where exactly we were supposed to check in because we already paid online to rent 3 bikes. On the phone they told me to go to the concession or to these two trailers in the parking lot. There was no one by the trailer so we go to the concession and the guy seemed kinda off put by the fact that we were there and didn't seem to of known we were coming. He opens up the trailer and fishes out two beach cruisers and we had to tell him we paid for three and he then proceeded to tell us that he didn't have another one but he had a mountain bike. We were like okay? He pulls out this rusty mountain bike that looked like it was on its last leg and that's when we just had to say we needed a refund because that is not what we paid for. They told us to text the number we had called them on a picture of our confirmation and that we were requesting a refund. Hopefully we will get our money back. Do not recommend.

"The food is good, the service is not quick, but the music is freaking fantastic!! My husband and son joined me to take advantage of a Groupon that I purchased for dinner at  Blues Ship Cafe. It's located in Ybor City right on 7th Ave. Our first impression was not great. There was no one there! It seems things don't get ""cookin"" until 8:30. We found a table and as we ordered and were served a few more people came in. By the time we got our food, and it did take awhile, there were 4 or 5 tables. When the singer, Bobby G Summers, started all heads turned and the rest of the night was like a dream. We felt like we would have payed $50-$100 for the performance. Bobby it seems has worked with Al Green and many other famous singers. Bobby is so talented we listened as he turned a Pink Floyd song into a blues rock song. It was amazing. I asked our very busy waitress and Bobby is there 3 out of 4 weekends. Look him up on YouTube and see him singing here at the Clearwater Jazz Festival with Earth, Wind and Fire.
I ordered the Southern Style Ribs with Cabbage and Collards. The ribs had just enough sauce and were tender and tasty. The Cabbage was by far the best thing on the table I think. The collards were also good, but not the best I've had. When I go back, I will probably get the same thing, except the corn bread. I have a weakness for corn bread and  I am not too picky, but the corn bread was not good.
My husband got Ribs and Shrimp with Red Beans and Rice and my son got the Chicken and Pork combo with fries and Red Beans and Rice. Both really liked their meals, but the red beans and rice was a bit odd. Like it had to much cumin, not bad, but different.
To top off our meal, and to delay leaving so we could listen to Bobby, we got their Key Lime Cake with ice cream. I would give it a 3 out of 5.
Over all our service was a bit slow. There was only one waitress and she was working hard, but it was a bit much for one person to handle. She was very nice and tried hard.

Across this place. It was not crowded for a Saturday night, lost of Parking space and very casual. They only serve wine, beer and sake (no prosecco).

"The store is right next-door to the Noble Rice restaurant on Platt Street. There's a small parking lot behind it.  They sell Japanese themed foods here which include some Japanese style sandwiches that are also popular on the West Coast US.  I was told that the bread they use for the sandwiches are fresh baked. I ended up getting the egg salad sando and their chicken katsu sando. Between the two, my favorite was the chicken katsu sando.

They also sell non-perishable Japanese groceries. Since I'm not here during the day time, I can't really speak for their poke bowls, but I heard they were good.  

I'm going to be honest, a lot of the stuff that they sell in the grocery portion of this place, you can get at any Oriental market. Though I'm sure these are good, a lot of their refrigerated items were way more expensive than I'm willing to purchase. 

I purchased and tried their Ramen kit (ramen, toppings, and crab miso ramen base) and found it very underwhelming. Ended up adding ebi fume furikake (Purchased elsewhere) to give it a little bit more flavor.  It was aight. The crab base didn't taste like crab at all.

"A HAIR on my food that was NOT mine. I started there to get your attention so you can fully read the review. 

The place is nice, highly decorated with the music at its perfect volume and in general kept clean. 

We were with a large group of people and decided to try their signature dish that is not in their menu. Being a person that loves sushi, my expectations were a little high. Specially if the mention steak and lobster on the same roll. Sushi was ok, not really over the top; pretty average. The problem was that when I was almost done with the roll I chew on a piece of HAIR that wasn't mine. 

One of my coworkers told the waiter. And he just said ""sorry about that"". I didn't receive a discount or even an APOLOGY from the manager. Why? Where was customer service there? At a restaurant, the least you expect is for a hair to come out on your plate and no one went above and beyond to make me feel appreciated it or valued as a customer. Complete waste of $38 bucks.

"5 stars because we had an amazing dinner, amazing dessert, amazing wine amazing service and an amazing time. 

We recently had my office Christmas party here. Pulling up, Valet was full, parking lot was full, parking garage was full, so we parked far far away in front of a department store. Walking that far in my new Christmas dress and heels was not fun. Still, I know this isn't Capital Grill's fault so they don't lose any stars for that. Walking in to the restaurant itself, was a completely different experience. 
We were greeted immediately by smiling faces which is always a good first sign. They escorted us to the stairs and up the stairs to our private room we went. There were several round tables which is great for talking to your co-workers. Immediately walking into the room a server greeted us to take our drink order and a second server with passed Hor d'oeuvres. Now I have to hug all of my friends with my hands full, but it was worth it. The servers were so attentive that my glass of wine was refilled twice before I even sat down. Maybe I was drinking fast, but they were on top of it!

We did have a smaller menu then normal in our party room but it was a pre-fix menu with 5 different choices. Most people chose a steak, but wanting to try something different I picked the Herb Chicken. Yes my table made fun of me for ordering chicken, but it was very good chicken. Crisp on the outside and served in a light chicken jus, it was very tasty. The side dishes were also very impressive. The Truffle Macaroni and Cheese is probably the best Mac and cheese I have ever had in my life. I am usually not a huge fan of Macaroni and cheese, but this one left me craving another bite. 
For Desert, creme brulee and flourless chocolate espresso cake.  The chocolate expresso cake was very rich and only for sincere chocolate lovers, so naturally, I loved it. The star of the show, was the Creme Brulee. It had a perfect crisp finish on top and came with fresh berries.  It was probably the first time in history that when sharing a desert with someone, I had no shame when I took claimed the last bite.

I did enjoy the lemony addition, just wished it had at least a few pieces of chicken instead of zulch because what I had was plain, boring, non picture worthy Greek Salad and Chicken Lemon soup. I was secretly eyeing my friend's Homemade Falafel Pita, which looked more appetizing and filling, something I would consider eating compared to what I was having and I'm not even a fan of Falafel!

"Deep fried stuffed potato.  When you take mashed potatoes, form them into a ball stuffed with ground beef and cheese, you coat the ball with breading and you deep fry it, you are as close to food Nirvana as you can get.   And it's not as easy as it sounds.  Not everyone can get the mixture just right.   And different ethnic groups give these delicacies their own little flavor.  But if you crave the biggest, most deliciously fried stuffed potato, check out Harborside Grill.

Harborside Grill is NOT your traditional restaurant.  It is more of a ""hole in the wall"" type place frequented by marine laborers, coast guard recruits, and folks looking for a good meal at a better price.  Be warned, though. It is not much to look at, inside or out, so if you are put off by places that don't look like Outback, look elsewhere.  But you will miss out on one of the hidden gems of Tampa Bay.  This is definitely a ""local knowledge"" place (mariners will know this reference).

They post a menu on a whiteboard, and the food is usually greasy, fried, full of butter or gravy.  And once in a while that is not a bad thing.  Their menu has breakfast items like pancakes, and lunch items like sandwiches, and burgers. But the true gem of the place is the deep fried stuffed potato.  They know how to cook it just right to make sure it's cooked all the way through without burning it, which is a minor miracle given how big the thing is.

Service is not exactly top notch, and if you go right at noon you'll run into the laborer crowd that absolutely LOVES this joint.  It gets packed!  And for good reason.

This place is not for everyone.  The atmosphere may be a bit rough for some, and there is NOTHING healthy on the menu.  But for those of us who love deep fried or greasy anything, gravy, butter, and cheese, and have VERY strong stomachs, I'd recommend visiting Harborside Grill.   At least once. :)",0,A,Harborside Grill,Harborside Grill,H@rborside Grill,4.0,NEGATIVE

"New business in a large shopping plaza off of N. Dale Mabry Avenue. Right behind the McDonald's. 
Parking is plenty and there is indoor and outdoor seating. Customer Service is friendly and attentive

We wanted to really love this place because it is convenient location wise to us. And the café itself is very spacious and clean. There is a section for pastries and it looks like tea. We did not try that so this review is purely based on the subs and drinks. 

Onto the food, we ordered the special banh mi and pork pattie banh mi. Vegetables are plentiful, The bread is more narrow and long compared to the average Vietnamese sub which makes it easier to eat . So that's good for carb conscience diet. The flavor and ratio however did not seem balanced. Meat is sparse and bland , it didn't have a wow factor . Usually on a special bánh mì each meat has its own flavor that adds to the sub. It was not horrible , but for about $5.50 a sub it did not justify the price compared to a lot of other Vietnamese sub places in Tampa. I'm hoping since it's a new business they will tweak the flavors of the meat more . Unless this is a franchise . 

We also ordered the artichoke tea and a lychee green tea with Coco lychee, light ice is a must. The artichoke tea is tasty and refreshing , it comes with herbal jelly, basil seeds, and popping crystal. The textures make for an interesting combination. Lychee green tea flavor was good. One thing I would improve on is the amount of ice and toppings, meaning less ice and more topping. Generally other boba places are generous on toppings , even after you finish the drink there is still a good amount that is left uneaten. With The slender tall cup , after a couple sips all the topping is gone. Will most likely be back to try the other flavor drinks and bakery section.",36,C,Banh Mi Factory,Banh Mi Factory,B@nh Mi F@ctory,3.0,POSITIVE

The pork was dry and inedible and the cauliflower steak was an old top to the plant and wasn't even cooked. So disgusting. We refused to eat and got them to take off the food.

We didn't even get aggravated until the food your establishment served us was a complete waste of the time we had given any of you. Sir you should find a new line of business for sure. And it was really cool of you to sit at the table up front with your friends and hang out while your terrible staff had people walking out on you business.

"Generally pleasant service, but seemingly has some technical/precedural issues.

I've eaten at this location on a fairly regular basis over the past half-year or so, and had been a customer of other Bob Evans in the past. On the whole, this location typifies the Bob Evans experience: the building is well-maintained both inside and out, the mood is calm and conducive to socializing with your party, the service is mostly friendly and competent, and the food is of acceptable quality--so long as you're willing to deal with a bit of quirkiness due to some . . . interesting managerial decisions.

When you eat here, I recommend asking for Jennifer or Nick as your server on weeknights or Madison on the weekend. They each offer well-above-average service and enjoyable personalities. I've rarely had a bad server at this location, and the managers are polite, as well.

As for the ""quirky"" management decisions, for one they have a tendency to clump customers together in the dining room, rather than spacing them apart, even when the restaurant is less than half full. I'm sure the reason has something to do with minimizing the amount of walking the staff need to do, and I can appreciate that, but I feel they could find a way to do so without cramming the customers together quite so tightly. As an example of why this is a bad idea, I offer my experince from tonight: the manager, Judy, sat a family of four at the table directly behind me then, in the process of attempting to put a booster seat at the table, hit me in the shoulder with it a couple of times. I wasn't hurt and she apologized immediately, but it was definitely not pleasant and there were eight other empty tables at which the family could have been seated that would have avoided the situation altogether. At the least, Judy could have warned me what she was about to do so I could get myself out of the way.

The kitchen likewise has issues, although the waitstaff seem aware of them, and work hard to shield the customers as much as possible. As has been mentioned by other Yelp reviewers, the kitchen seems to run out of items on a regular basis--the family of four mentioned above attempted to order mac-n-cheese for their children, only to be told it wasn't available. 

The cooks seem technically competent, as the food is generally moist, flavorful, and appealing in presentation, but there, too, they have certain procedural issues. An example of that is with their current heavily-promoted special, a Brioch French toast with blueberry topping, which has quickly become a favorite of mine. The French toast itself has always been perfectly prepared, golden-brown and just chewy enough to feel good in the mouth. However, the kitchen's policy is to pull the blueberry topping directly from the refrigerator and pour it over the the piping hot toast. Needless to say, the combination of hot toast and 40-degree-cold berries leaves you with a plate of unappitizing, luke-warm food. The servers I've spoken with have noted a number of customers complaining about it, and usually recommend the customers ask for the topping to be warmed prior to serving, but it is up to the customer to actually make the request. 

I also questioned one of the managers--I didn't catch the name on her tag, unfortunately--and she advised me it is necessary for food ingredients to be kept at or below 40 degrees per law, and there was nothing they could do about that, which seems like a non-answer to me. After all, the sausage I ordered as a side-item to my meal would likewise have been kept at such temperatures, but was heated as a matter of course before being served to me. Why should a customer need to make a special request to not be served a lukewarm dish? I count this as another odd management decision.

Quirks aside, I do recommend this location if you're looking for a place to have a pleasant meal and good conversation with friends or family, just don't be afraid to tell your server exactly what you want. And remember to tip well! :-)",34,C,Bob Evans,Bob Evans,Bob Ev@ns,4.0,POSITIVE

Of course, as always, their beer selection is fairly extensive. I was actually expecting a bit more from the drafts, but I guess it's my fault that I've tried most of them already. However, once I started going through the bottle list? Man oh man! So many new beers to try. Here's a fun tidbit. You can also take bottles home from WoB at a discount.

Service was wonderful... waitress was very sweet, and patient with my attempts at Spanish. Everybody there was very friendly!

The ambience of the place really reminds be of some of the small South American places I have been while diving, laid back, and relaxed. Even the exterior reminds me off some places I have been... and no, that is not a negative. Inside is just cool... makes you feel at home!

"Stopped in for lunch earlier this week when a class unexpectedly canceled (yay for a leisurely lunch!). Since I was there right after they opened, it was only myself and one other customer, though I watched many people come and go as I sat and ate.
It seemed a little dark in the restaurant, but there was a lot of natural light coming in through the windows, as one entire side of the place is floor to ceiling glass. Still, the lack of overhead light felt like I came in early before they were really ready to open. I know, I know, it's weird. 

Anyway, I ordered the BBQ bowl (spinach, brown rice, onions, cheese, and black beans with steak. It was a bit pricier than I expected it to be at $17, but I suppose that higher quality food will be more expensive - and there are cheaper options, should meat not be what you're looking for.
I found this bowl to be pretty large and filling. I would have only eaten half and saved the rest for later if I wasn't spending the afternoon in a classroom. All that to say that the portions do seem big enough to break into smaller meals if desired. There was A LOT of spinach and onion in my bowl, and I felt like I tasted those flavors for the rest of the day. It was mildly off-putting, but maybe that wouldn't have been the case had I poured the BBQ sauce on the food instead of using it as a dip.

The menu shows that they also serve salads and wraps, which look delicious as pictured, in addition to soups, smoothies, and juices. I definitely want to try a salad next time I stop in.
All ingredients are clearly listed, which is a plus for me, as I'm still working on navigating the eating-out scene as a gluten-free eater.

"My boyfriend and I came in today, and unfortunately, didn't have the greatest experience. I was really excited about trying the food, as I'm from the west coast and love tacos de birria. 

When we walked in, the lady at the register was on the phone taking in order, which was no problem, we waited for her to finish and then placed our order with another young girl. I ordered a taco de birria as a combo, and my boyfriend ordered a birria quesadilla combo. We were told if he wanted a jarrito their was no substitution for that in the combo, so we would have to pay for it full price. We said that was fine. 

We took our seat outside after grabbing our drinks, and waited. Then waited some more, then after about 30 minutes more of waiting, we decided we should check on our food, as 30 minutes for one taco and one quesadilla, is pushing it for 2 pm on a Tuesday, (in a restaurant that was not busy). Plus people who came in after us were getting their food.

Finally after my boyfriend got up and checked he came back with our food. My taco was good! However my beans and rice was cold and fairly bland. My boyfriend did not have any sides, even though we asked for a combo for him. We had already waited so long we didn't want to ask for them, and have to wait some more, so we just ate and quickly left out of their. 

I want to say that the staff was friendly, although the young girl who helped us seemed to be really struggling. Minus the sides, the food was decent, but unfortunately the kitchen taking so long, and the order being messed up/not taken correctly (not sure which one it was), didn't give us the greatest first impression.

"Renzo's is one of those places stuck in the middle of the long strip of stores right where Dale Mabry necks down one lane above the Handy/North Village intersection going north.  
I was expecting one of those South America ""eat meat until you burst"" places with the waiters walking around with meat on a spit but this was a sit down and order.  What did I order?  Diet cokes and the Renzo's Parrilla, which is basically ""eat meat until you burst"".  Its a 7 meat sampler for two (hey, my wife was with me!) of the various cuts that are available with the other entrees, including beef, chicken and pork.  It is brought out on a small grill that keeps most of the meat hot/warm until you get around to them.  The last cut was starting to cool down when I ate it.
Each cut had its own distinct seasoning and flavor, some like the skirt steak were a little chewy but the top sirloin, as expected, were the better cuts.  
They also serve a variety of sandwiches, both hot and cold.  My wife finished up with the Tres Leches dessert, which she liked.
There were indeed, outside tables but since this was still late September and somewhat hot outside, we choose the inside dining area.  Traffic was a little light inside but started picking up around 6:30 pm.  

The service was attentive and good humored.  
The price was about medium, not overly high (two people around upper 40's).

My favorite dish was the vegetable quinoa stuff and the pigs in a blanket. The mimosas and bloody Marys were scrumptious as well. And finally, our waitress was nice and attentive. 

My main issue was the cost of brunch seemed a bit exorbitant. None of the food was mind blowing, so I suppose ultimately what I was paying for was the bottomless drinks.",10,A,Grille 54,Grille 54,Grille 54,4.0,NEGATIVE

"Nice new restaurant in South Tampa. The parking lot was full but there is valet parking on site.
When we arrived at 6 pm on Friday the restaurant was almost full. By the time we left it was completely full. I made the reservation six days in advance and couldn't find reservation for Saturday night.
I like the atmosphere and the vibes of Olivia. One thing I must say it's pretty loud. We looked around and almost all the people around our table, were basically screaming to hear each other. Dining here 2.5 weeks after a vocal cords surgery was a bit tough for my voice.

Our waitress Jamie was nice and she recommended us few dishes.
Jamie asked if we would like a basket of the focaccia, of course we said yes.it was delicious. 

I started with the Spritz and Giggles. I thought it was a bit diluted so I asked Jamie to add more Aperol and Prosecco. It came back much better. Just right! 

For appetizer we had the polenta fries with red sauce. It was good. I give it three stars.
We ordered the margarita pizza- five stars.
The Gnudi ( ricotta, pistachio in lemon sauce ) was good but I wouldn't order it again- three stars.

We were too tired to order dessert.

Overall I would dine here again. Next time I want to try other dishes and I might be luckier.",19,B,OLIVIA,OLIVIA,OLIVIA,4.0,POSITIVE
"This place has a pretty cool concept. I am obsessed with cereal flavored everything. The barista was very nice and informative. She let me sample the cereal milk before choosing to order a latte.

This inside has beautiful artwork and cool music selection.

The lattes comes in three sizes: 8oz, 12oz, and 14oz.   

I got a almond cereal milk latte (hot) and a fruity pebble cookie. The latte has great potential, I am not sure why I was not able to finish it all. I am leaning to the fact that maybe the coffee was burnt. I got home and poured it over ice to water it down and it still wasn't it for me. 

I love strong coffee, I love hot coffee, and I love cereal flavor so I am not sure what it was. The cereal milk itself was amazing when she let me sample it. 

The cookie was my favorite! Highly recommend. The fruity pebble cookie is GINORMOUS. I shared it with my dad (next time I will just buy two)! I thought it was brick hard at first, but I was so wrong- the inside is moist and perfect. 

They offer affogatos with espresso poured over cereal flavored ice cream, regular bowls of cereal, and much more. 

Maybe this is for more of local residents within walking distance because there is a parking area butI believe I saw one or two designated parking for the Milkin' It business, the rest was for other businesses. I had to park there and make my stop very quick to avoid any tickets or tow.

There is parking across the street but believe it is for another business, as well.

"A huge shout out to this Boston Market location!  Super friendly and clean store.  Boston market is a generally good chain with American comfort food menus. Everyone loves Boston Market food! 

The reason I am writing this review is to bring attention to their catering and large take out options.  I came in to order food for family after a funeral.  I was taking food for 10 to eat and I wanted plenty left over for next day meals and snacks so I was in that in-between area between full catering and regular take out.  They were so helpful in guiding me to options that would provide variety and be plentiful.  Really, really helpful - Even advising me on which items would provide more food quantity for the money.  When I arrived to pick up the food later in the day, they had really gone the extra mile packing it so it was easy for me to deliver and still presented very nicely. They even had a nice gentleman help me carry the food to the car!   I will remember them as a go to affordable place for this type of special case or in between catering - I mean really, I don't host a ton of 50+ events, but I take a lot of food to people in the 10-20 meal range - what a find!!!

We were here when it was crabby bills, and it was pretty good, but now everything about it is subpar.  The service was slow, did not refill drinks as needed, and the appetizer and main course took an excessively long time to arrive.  The pork dumplings appetizers were hard and dried out, soaking them in the soy sauce dip helped some.  My wife ordered the chicken quesadilla and stated she has had better from Taco Bell, plus the guacamole had a funny taste to it, hope she doesn't get sick! I ordered the bacon burger with fries.  They actually charged me an extra $1.00 for fries!!  Unbelievable.  My food was edible thanks to copious amounts of ketchup.

"I love Panera bread's Cinnamon crunch bagel. There I said it. It's even better when it's toasted. No cream cheese (no need to add extra time on the treadmill). Because I am a member of their club, my bagel was FREE. Actually, I get a free bagel everyday this month (don't be jelly, just sign up today).

This location is extremely busy during lunch time, mostly because it's close to St Joseph's. Lots of parking available since it's in a plaza. There's also a Drive-thru feature for those in a hurry. Plus you can order online thru your phone - genius! Plenty of seating inside and outside of the restaurant. 

When not indulging on a bagel, I go for their soups. Broccoli cheddar would be my fave. The reason I got chunky would be because I had too many during my college years. Asian chicken salad is my second favorite. Apparently it's only available certain times of the year, boohoo. Last but not least, Frontega chicken paninis are the bomb.com

"Have you ever thought to yourself ""try something new?"" I sure have and I thought trying this place would be great cause a friend of mine loves this place. I ordered the Tonkatsu ramen with no additions to the soup and the matcha mochi cake. The presentation was perfect and eye catching. However, that was really all I enjoyed from my meal. I was severely disappointed by the flavors of the soup and the texture of the noodles. I felt like I was eating packaged ramen noodles for $14.50 a bowl. The noodles were very thin and stringy like the package you buy in store compared to other ramen shops I've gone too. The broth flavoring was honestly disappointing, while it lacked flavor the flavors didn't melt right. Just tasted too salty and pungent. I had then moved onto the mochi matcha cake and was disappointed in this dessert as well. Going in I knew the cake would have a different texture due to the mochi aspect, but there's hardly any flavor to the cake and it's like chewing bread that's like jello. If you're squicked by weird texture of food, I'd say skip this dessert and try something else. 

The service was friendly and polite; in addition to my meal coming out quick. My best friend however, loves the ramen here, so it could be I just don't find the food pleasant. So give it a try if you're so inclined and hopefully you'll enjoy it! However, I can say I more than likely will grab food from other shops in Armature works instead of stopping by here again.

I order the Greek salad without potato salad and add a chicken skewer. It's super fresh and healthy. You could easily rack up the calories here, but I order wisely and reluctantly skip the extra dressing or tzatziki sauce, which is sour cream based. It's still tasty, but I'd like the real deal. Their hot sauce is packed with a hot garlic punch though and mixes well with the sour cream for a little spice to your traditional gyro. 

Their kitchen is quick and accurate. Lines get long at lunch and they're pushing orders through and have yet to make a mistake, which can understandably happen during the lunch rush and often does. Not here. Staff is friendly and helpful like other locations, too.

"South Tampa's loss is certainly Carrollwood's gain, as this long-time popular bistro along Azeele Street moved up north to set down some roots at the intersection of N. Dale Mabry Highway and South Village Drive. Circles Bistro now sits in the Carrollwood Village Shops shopping center along with Chili's, World of Beer, Anthony's Coal-Fired Pizza, and Ocean Blue Sushi. Circles is on the very west end of this shopping plaza, facing South Village Drive.

Some of you might remember that Circles was a well-known Carrollwood bistro with a disastrous parking problem, and that's why they pulled up stakes and moved to South Tampa. Now some 13 years later, the Prodigal Son has returned to Carrollwood in a shopping center with lots of available parking spaces.

I was there for Sunday Brunch with my adorable girlfriend, and we were midway through a furniture assembly project of epic proportions when she suggested that we should find something to eat. A quick scan of my trusty Yelp app, and we found ourselves at Circles Bistro which was near to our neighborhood Lowe's.

The outside of Circles Bistro disguises the serene atmosphere inside, and that has always been one of Circles hidden charms. This is a place where you can walk inside and say hi to Michael and Judy. Judy is the chef, while Michael works the front of the house and tends to the bar. There are only about 12 - 15 tables in the restaurant, and about 15 barstools surrounding the bar. The tables all face out to the enclosed courtyard. There is no Wi-Fi service inside the restaurant, and they recommend that their patrons converse with each other, or read through the Sunday paper.

I started my meal with a spicy Bloody Mary, and Brittany ordered a mimosa. After perusing the various breakfast & brunch options I selected a seafood omelet made with sautéed shrimp, scallops, lump crabmeat, and lobster meat with sweet onions and melted Monterey Jack cheese. Britt ordered the goat cheese, spinach & tomatoes omelet. Both omelets came with a choice of home fried potatoes or a fresh fruit medley, and we both opted for the fruit.

While Michael was mixing our drinks, Judy came out of the kitchen to deliver the homemade multi-grain bread with a strawberry compound butter. Oh yum!!!! The omelets arrived shortly thereafter, and they were delicious. In my case lots of very good seafood, covered with melted cheese inside of a fluffy omelet. The fresh fruit medley had a nice mix of apples, strawberries, blueberries, melon, and grapes. Very delicious meal for $12 a piece, plus the drinks.

The brunch menu at Circles has lots of traditional egg dishes and some lighter entrées. Even though seating is limited you are encouraged to relax and enjoy your meal without being made to feel rushed.

The traditional lunch and dinner menu lists a wider variety of casual multi-cultural dining options including Italian, Asian, Cajun, Indonesian, and classic Americana meals. Prices for these meals are closer to $20, and that includes soup or salad. Rumor has it that their lobster bisque is legendary, so I'll go back soon to give that a try.

Circles has a full bar and a rather-large wine cellar, but precious little storage space for the cases of wine as they arrive. Expect to see the boxes lined up in the hallway as you walk back to their dining room.

Bottom line -- a nice place for a quiet Sunday brunch where you can relax and enjoy your food and drink.",3,A,Circles Bistro,Circles Bistro,circles bistro,4.0,NEGATIVE
"I think China Moon is one of the best to-go fast food Chinese places in the area. It's not a place to eat, as there are just a few seats inside to sit and wait, but it is a great spot for takeout.  

They actually are very speedy too when it comes to delivery, and I love that my delivered orders have all been correct. The only error I've had is when I actually picked it up in store-they forgot to give me sauce for the dumplings (which you know is the best part).

Favorites here are the vegetable soup, the hot and sour soup, Vegetable Mei Fun (rice noodles), and the vegetarian Home Style To Fu. Dumplings and egg rolls are good.

"Solid 4 stars on food and 10 stars for service. Our server Roberto was amazing!

Tutored Chef is located on the 2nd floor of the Art Institute of Tampa. This quarter, the student chefs  are offering dinner courses on Tuesdays and Wednesdays from 6pm-8pm. The themes of the menus change per month, we got to try their Mexican menu tonite and next few months will specialize French/American cuisine which I am thrilled to try. Make reservations as this place gets busy quite fast.

You can choose to have 1 course for $5 or go all out with 5 courses for $16. I opted for 5 because why not lol. 

1st course: Ceviche 
2nd course: Chicken tortilla soup 
3rd course: spinach and chorizo salad 
4th course: Chile Rilleno 
5th course: pork chop 

Chile Rilleno and pork chop was my faves on the nite. Salad was great but it was such a small portion (2 bites). Ceviche was good, needed more citrus notes to round out the dish. Soup was my least favorite dish, there was no depth of flavor.  

Overall, better than I expected. I'll def be back (already made reservations for next month lol).

"i was with friends who wanted to use a coupon, but i could sense that this was a place that took no pride in its food.  my dinner confirmed this.  neither the BBQ chicken or pork had ever seen smoke, and we clearly re-heated from day(s) before..  the read beans rice were very dull, with an overdose of cayenne to compensate--- leaving it tasting dull and hot, if that makes any sense.  the tiny square of cornbread counted as a side ($3 a la carte!), and was overly dense and strangely springy.  I barely touched my dinner, knowing of half a dozen places within a few blocks for good food cooked by people who give a damn.  our server knew better than to ask how it was.

"This is just another reminder of why I don't go to Tampa clubs. This place is the worst. Let me paint you a picture of pure garbage. 

Issue 1 was at the door. There was a celebrity appearance so the happy hour price was $20 for bottom shelf and $40 for top shelf. However, if you were not drinking, they still wanted to charge $20. I kept asking is this a cover or a happy hour special and no one could answer. 

The bouncer at the door was a straight up liar. First, he said beer was included in the happy hour/cover price. Then, he said Absolut was bottom shelf. Lies. All lies. 

So after paying $20 for the ""cover,"" one would presume they were stepping into a nice bar. This place is in shambles. The bathrooms were like a scene from a horror film even though it was early in the night. There was poop and toilet paper everywhere. 

On the patio, you can sit at a table if no one has reserved it. How much is a reservation you ask? $100. Now, this wouldn't have annoyed me so much if the tables were at least nice looking, but no. Like the rest of the bar, they were scratched up messes in disrepair. 

Oh and the celebrity who was the reason for the increased happy hour cost... He was supposed to perform at midnight. At 1a, he was posted up in the VIP section, drinking and feeling up a lady. So not even that could go right! 

The only saving grace of the night were the staff on the back porch. The bartenders and attendant were the nicest people we dealt with, and for them, I am thankful. 

I would give 0 stars, but that is not an option.",26,B,Green Gators Bar & Grill,Green Gators Bar & Grill,Green G@tors B@r & Grill,1.0,NEGATIVE

"I went to CineBistro last weekend with a group of about 20 friends to see Magic Mike. We met in the bar and ordered drinks while waiting for our theater to be ready. The bartenders were very nice. I just had a soda so I can't give a drink review. The lounge area behind the bar has big comfortable chairs and was a fun place to hang out with my friends before the movie.

Once the theater was ready we all found our seats and were immediately approached by servers to place our orders and get our food and drinks before the movie started. The run the food orders in the theater like a well-oiled machine. They warn you that there will be no more service past a certain point in the movie, so order whatever you want for the entire movie before it starts. In addition to dinner items, they also have movie theater classics like popcorn and candy.

The menu at CineBistro is upscale, including gourmet items as well as classic favorites. My friend and I shared the oven baked goat cheese as an appetizer. The fruit and nuts with the goat cheese and toasty bread was wonderful. For my entree I chose the Bistro burger and fries. (see photo) I was feeling the need for comfort food and this hit the spot.

The servers and ushers were so great with our large group. For Magic Mike the men were even dressed up as characters from the movie (see photo). They were great sports taking a group photo with all us crazy ladies.

I come here for the chicken wings and love how flexible they are with customizing your meal. The place is small, it can seat about 15 people. Its a takeout place so don't expect anything fancy. 

I got fried chicken wings tossed in General Tso sauce(instead of the honey or buffalo sauce) with white rice. I'm not a fan of fried rice so I never get it. I appreciate the fact that they cut the wings in half. My order came with four pieces of chicken wings and they tasted great, like always lol! I've ordered the honey wings in the past and they were good too! My total came up to $7.44 (they charge extra for the General Tso sauce)

The Cuban sandwich itself is delicious and well priced around 7.80 after tax. 

I don't appreciate that the minimum automatic tip display begins at 20% for both dine in and take out. Even for takeout the minimum should be 10%.  It just screams ""give me handouts"". Even the tip jar has a little quote about giving that means we'll but isn't appropriate for a tip jar.  Idk. Those are my peeves because I shouldn't be automatically prompted to give a 20% tip for basic service when someone won't even look me in the eye when taking my order or as I am paying them.

Seriously, amazing pastries (I had the Nutella croissant today and it made me want to hurry home and go to bed so I could get up early and head back to The Vine tomorrow for more AMAZINGNESS).

"Natalie and Steve, this review is long overdue! I had to set up a Yelp account just to tell everyone how I feel about Paci's. Paci's Pizza is, hands down, the best pizza in Tampa. As a native New Yorker, I've had some good pie. I've been in the Tampa-bay area since 2006 and have been on the hunt for quality pizza all this time. The best thing that has happened to the Tampa pizza scene is Paci's. 

The pies are the stars of this show. The crust is thin enough to not be doughy, and gives a good sooty crack when you fold it in half (the proper way to eat a slice). The toppings are generous and fresh (especially the meatballs). The sauce isn't overly tangy or spiced. It hits the sweet-spot for me. Of course, Paci's calling card is the enormous size of their pies, fall out the box big, with wedge slices the size of your face. I'll recommend the classic Margherita pie (simple with mozzarella, diced tomato, basil, and olive oil), Paci's Special Pie (which is loaded with different toppings), or my own concoction (pepperoni, jalapeño, and meatball). 

The ambiance is great. I've brought my wife, my brother, and my parents. They all loved it. And, once they reopen their doors, I'll be bringing my one-year old. Her first slice is going to be a Paci's slice. My wife is a big fan of their salads, which come in big, metal bowls and are loaded with veggies. Wine by the glass is also a hit, they've always got a nice selection of house reds to choose from. I sometimes opt for the Brooklyn style root beer (goes great with a spicy pie, load up on the red pepper flakes).

"My friend has been ranting about how her crab loving family visits Pinchers for special occasions. Usually, I don't trust crab reviews from people who only eat snow crab legs because I am a blue crab Floridian! It's just not the same. 

We came here on a Saturday afternoon and it was pretty empty, skeptical! Our waitress was very polite and patient. I am used to whole blue crabs, spread out on a picnic table, making a whole mess! Pinchers calls this ""Maryland style"" and we don't. We're in Florida, never heard the term, cut that out. I opted for the 12 blue crabs whatever that's called to them (cleaned and split...cheaper than the messier whole crab for some reason, but I'm not complaining) steamed with garlic butter and Old Bay, extra Old Bay!

"Let's be honest, these homemade doughnuts are far superior compared to national chains like Dunkin' Doughnuts (their doughnuts are frozen, not freshly made) or Krispy Kreme (freshly made doughnuts but not every store makes it onsite & usually doughnuts are sourced from a main location). 

Nicola's Donut Shop used to be on way route to work downtown but just because I don't go in that direction anymore doesn't mean I stop making an effort to visit. I come here as often as I can. They're located in a nondescript strip on Busch Blvd by 275. 

This place is easily one of the best kept secrets of Tampa and their doughnuts are soooo good that I've easily gotten other people addicted to them. The prices aren't bad at all and costs $1 for their traditional doughnuts (Bavarian Cream Filled, White Cream Filled, Chocolate Banana, White Cream Filled etc.) and specialty doughnuts cost $2 (Maple Bacon, Nutella, Brownie Brittle, Apple Fritters, Peanut Butter & Jelly, etc.).

Doughnuts (5/5): Their Vanilla Chocolate Iced doughnut is easily my go to vice. Not only is it a bargain, costing around $1, the sweet aroma of the chocolate frosting coupled with airy, light dough can be eaten by itself or with coffee/milk. Their doughnut on its own leaves you wanting more. I love the fact their frosting isn't sickeningly sweet and doesn't leave your mouth with the need to chase it down with a drink. On their own, each doughnut serves it's purpose with a light, well-balanced amount of sugar and the toppings are generous. For example, their Maple Bacon doughnut has the right amount of maple glaze with a good amount of bacon for $2. Who would've known that those ingredients paired nicely together?

The customer service is always great and the store is bright with a variety of doughnuts, muffins, cupcakes and pastries. They've been open since 1982, serving handmade donuts on a daily basis Sunday to Wednesday 5:30am to 1:00pm and Thursday to Saturday 5:30am to 2:00pm. There's more than 50+ options to pick from and even the toughest critic would be able to find a doughnut to satisfy their appetite; there's something for everyone to choose from!",13,A,Nicola's Donut Shop,Nicola's Donut Shop,Nicola's Donut Shop,4.0,POSITIVE

A for real hour...sat down at 7 and walked out after 8. Ordered the bread appetizer and 20 mins later it still never came, it's bread. Barely got an apology. Server seemed oblivious it took forever. Will not go back. Also, the manager was giving a stern talking to to one of the employees at the host stand when we got there.

"Came here for lunch with my daughter, and it was okay. We used to come here alot about 20 years ago. They had a decent lunch menu as far as selection and prices, so we ordered Chirashi and Yaki Udon plus a volcano roll from the regular menu. The seafood in the Chirashi was plentiful, like eye candy, but some I felt was not super fresh. I took most of it home and made Bibimbap with it. The Yaki Udon, which is like a stir fry, was okay. It lacked any specific seasoning to make it any more than mediocre. There doesn't seem to be a standard for how sushi restaurants make their volcano rolls. My all time favorite is made with conch,  from Samarai Blue. This one is made with salmon, which is my second fav, and it was pretty good.  The components were nicely balanced, making a very nice tasting mouthful.

I highly recommend the 2+2+2; the crêpes are excellent and the eggs aren't dried out. Goldilocks-style: ""just right"". Food is best when prepared with personal attention and the chef does just that. There are stools at the counter or booths you can disappear in easily and the coffee or tea (fresh-brewed) is replenished when needed without having to ask. Not into breakfast?

"I've loved afternoon tea since I was in elementary school. My mom used to take me on my birthday, or to celebrate other special occasions. One year, I surprised her for Mother's Day with a homemade afternoon tea -- complete with finger sandwiches and scones made from scratch. She loved it... tea time was always our thing.

I lost my mom a few years ago, and Mother's Day is always especially hard for me. Every year, I try to do something to honor her. This year, with most places being closed, I wracked my brain trying to come up with something -- and then it clicked.

You see, I first visited the Royal Tea Room last year with some friends, not long after moving to Tampa. So when I saw they were doing tea to-go for Mother's Day, I instantly knew I had to take part. I called several days in advance, and was told they were just about sold out -- but when I told them it would just be for one person and it was to honor my mom, they kindly obliged.

I picked up my bag with no problems, and they included a menu of what was inside along with detailed instructions on how to steep the tea -- even how to warm the pot properly! On the menu: lemon blueberry scones with clotted cream and strawberry preserves, a three cheese tomato tartlet, cucumber and herb cream cheese finger sandwich, and a grape and celery chicken salad in a small croissant. For dessert, they had a tiny chocolate cup with cream and fresh fruit, a bite-sized cupcake, and a chocolate strawberry. They also included their lovely brown sugar pieces (they look a little bit like pebbles, I'm not sure what the proper name for them is), which melt beautifully in the tea and are far superior to white sugar.

Absolutely everything was delicious. Mind you, I don't like cucumber, but it's sliced so thinly in that sandwich that I even ate that with no problem. It might not look like a lot of food, but it certainly fills me up. For the tea, I used my mom's favorite bone china teacup :) 

I've had a LOT of afternoon teas over the years at places across the country, but Royal Tea Room is undoubtedly one of the best. I'm so thankful they helped me celebrate my mom this way.",25,B,Royal Tea Room & Gift Shoppe,Royal Tea Room & Gift Shoppe,Royal Tea Room & Gift Shoppe Inc.,5.0,NEGATIVE

"Been meaning to come here for a while too. Im surprised there are no reviews for this place considering its been open for quite a while now. 
Anywho, on with the reivew:

The Outside: Parking is in a semi-private lot, shared with a few other restaurants. There really isn't anything spectacular about the outside; there are 2 benches for people waiting to get seated.  

The Inside: Big! There are seats everywhere. The kitchen is in the back and is visible from the main dining area. There is a bar on the right side, as well as the arcade and the restroom hall. 

The Food: The menu has a variety of items to eat. Cold, hot, fried, you name it. But if you came here for the pizza this is where it all changes. The pizza is flat, but it's not in slices. NO, it's in squares! The center squares are about 2"" by 2"", the other pieces are hard to measure. And don't expect a square pizza; this is a traditional round pizza.

Over all it was a good experience. Make reservations because it does get packed, most restaurants get packed on a Friday evening.

"This was my first and last visit to Studio Movie Grill. The entry is enticing, the bar looks well stocked. There were a few people at the bar but it was only 1:00 PM. Once you pass the facade and enter the inner realm it becomes a dated worn theater. We have a dining theater back home so I did have a good idea what to expect. I'll just list.

Ordering:
Once the lights are out you can't see the menu period so you better order before or memorize what you want. I had expected tiny pen lights hooked to the table but they did not exist.

Food and drinks:
The food was pricey, I just got nachos for $10. I ordered a Moscow mule and asked that they bring water too. I got the nachos in roughly 20 minutes. They advise arriving early and I'm glad I did. I waited almost 40 minutes for the Moscow mule which was served in a glass, not a copper mug and it was possibly the most watered down tasteless drink I have ever had in my life. It does not take a rocket scientist to make a Moscow mule AND it was a featured drink. Seriously???

(This is for my handicapped friends)
The bathroom:
After the show the bathroom was a swampy mess. I am handicapped and had to wait 15 minutes for one of the two  handicapped restrooms to be come free. The other seemed to be locked with no one inside.

The floor was so wet but it was the only option I had. I fell as the bars weren't placed properly. It was absolutely disgusting, I could not bring myself to call for help, I was too angry and humiliated. I had planned on doing a few other things while I was out but after that I had to go back to my AirBNB to sterilize myself and my clothes.

"Healthy options that fill you up.

I'm a huge salad fan. I don't cook much at home and when I do it rarely includes vegetables. Therefore, when I go out I always try to get my greens in. This restaurant is a very reasonable way to do so.

They subtract the weight of the bowl so you don't have to worry about that. The salad that I built was less than 1 lb and the soup was less than .5 lb! This made my meal come out to about $10, which is a great price point for lunch.

I love how they have little cups to try the dressing and the soups. If they didn't have those, I probably wouldn't have gotten a soup, but after trying the loaded baked potato I had to get a bowl. They also have the ingredients for each soup listed next to them. That's how I knew the loaded baked potato soup has heavy cream. Hey, I needed to balance the healthiness of the salad. 

Randomly, they don't have avocados or candied nuts, but pretty much anything else I would ever put on a salad was there. I wasn't a huge fan of the dressings, I tried a lot of them, so I went with olive oil. In the end I was happy with my salad.

At first I was a little put off because there was a sign printed out on regular paper and taped to the door.  For some reason those kinds of signs always worry me.  But it just said not to worry about the expiration date on your Groupon, that they will continue to honor it.  So OK....in the door we go!  I was pleasantly surprised when we walked in.  The lighting was low, the decor was intimate, and the music was background music, not intrusive at all.  
Our server was very friendly and knowledgeable.  The menu is extensive, with Thai and Japanese offerings.  We were in the mood for sushi but I will definitely go back and try some of the Thai food.  Since we had not been to the restaurant before we just chose the JoTo boat as a sampler.  It was a very good deal.  For $43 ($33 because of my Groupon) we got soup and salad (the soup was mushroom and had very good flavor, I like the citrus dressing on the salad), sashimi, seaweek salad, krab nachos and several rolls.

"As a former vegan (now vegetarian) college student making the ride from St. Petersburg to Tampa every day, getting in some good nutrition + a tasty meal became hectic due to my schedule. A lot of times I didn't have time to prepare a meal, and having a bagel with hummus on campus became redundant. Through word of mouth I heard of an awesome restaurant by the name of Trang Viet down on Fowler Ave. 

The first time I went in there I found a clean, quiet restaurant with staff hard at work while remaining incredibly friendly and helpful. I became ecstatic to find a large vegan and vegetarian friendly menu with a spectrum of options to choose from. The staff was very knowledgeable on vegan nutrition and very helpful with my questions and concerns. To top it off, I was delighted to see they had a lunch special (main dish, soup, and spring roll) from 11:30 am to 3 pm during the week for an awesome price. Score!

This place became a regular stop on my way to and from Tampa. The fake chicken curry and vegan steamed buns are a staple every time I go, always fresh to order, and leaves me craving more even after I've gone back home.

"Castellano and Pizzo is a cute little Italian grocery store off of Henderson Blvd. in South Tampa.  This is a great spot to get italian bread or desserts, olives or cheeses, or a home cooked italian meal, but that's the extent of what I would buy here.

I have mixed feelings on this store.  Even though they have an excellent selection of Italian treats the store seems to be breaking several health codes.  The produce selection is poor and the area smells like a combination of bleach and rotted food.  The meat counter is usually half empty and the selections have gotten worse over the years.  The gelatto cooler is gone, which seems like such a poor marketing decision since fro yo and gelatto are all the rage now.  The salad bar and the hot bar are great spots to grab lunch, but come early before everything gets picked over.

"I am sad to say that I think this location is going down hill. This used to be our go-to place for a nice dinner. It isn't cheap but you could consistently expect the food to be high quality and well executed. Not this time. First of all, they remodeled the place and the waiter wanted to tell us all about that. Maybe they are more focused on decor now than the food. I thought it looked fine before and I don't go to restaurants strictly for how they look inside. We always get the bang bang shrimp so we ordered that. I bit into a nice crunchy chunk of shell which has never happened before. Also, you could see some of the shrimp were little bits of shrimp instead of full pieces. Your server used to bring your drinks, now they have separated that out to other staff. It took forever for us to get our draft beer orders each time even though we were 2 feet from the bar. My mom ordered the seared tune steak. It was an oddly shaped piece of tuna (looked like some scrap piece) and to top it off it was not seared (rare in the middle) but completely cooked all the way though, not a trace of red or even pink. My boyfriend got the 'special' snapper and it was 2 oddly shaped end pieces that were thin and just not very good.

"Why 5 stars? Because this is my new go-to for all things shaved ice and rolled ice cream!

   ---   ---   ---

Snowman Rolling Ice Cream, where have you been all my life?

Yelp TB celebrities, Boon and Grace, visited here recently and felt compelled enough to share their experience on the Yelp Talk Thread. They go to a lot of places and don't usually post about it in Talk, so I knew it had to be special.

Boon and Grace = my new heroes.

The shaved ice here is like nothing I've ever seen before. It comes out of some kind of machine that's so much different than what you normally see. This is going to make it sound so gross, but it literally looks like the shaved ice gets pooped out from this thing. I promise you... the taste does not reflect that. It's actually quite the opposite of poop. (Sorry I keep saying poop.)

Aside from the soft, pillow-like texture, you can add an array of toppings to your selection - think: fro-yo shop level variety! I threw a bunch of stuff on mine and went to town. It was amazing and perfect - a no-brainer 5-stars from me!

Chris W joined us on our trip and he went with cookies and cream rolled ice cream. I'd had rolled ice cream at a couple of places over the last year, and really enjoyed it... but this.... THIS was the best I've ever had. It really packed a punch with the flavor! As much as I loved the shaved ice, I was almost regretting not ordering my own serving of ice cream.

If you mention Yelp when you check out, you score 10% off your order, and they have numerous Yelp signs all throughout the building, which is even another reason to love this place!

So just like that... this is my new favorite ice cream shop in Tampa Bay!",11,A,Snowman Rolling Ice Cream,Snowman Rolling Ice Cream,Snowman Rolling Ic3 Cr3am,5.0,POSITIVE

The Carmelita bar was UNREAL as a small dessert.  If you're looking for chicken or shrimp this is the wrong place.  But if you're super healthy this place is definitely a potential habit former.

"This Five Guys location opened mid-late May of 2014 so it's brand new. Located in Carrollwood off of N. Dale Mabry next to where Berryism used to be and two stores to the right of 1-800-flowers. In the same center with Starbucks, Brunchies and Abby's Nutritional Store. 

I walked in about an hour before closing (got there around 9 pm) and was greeted by just about everyone from the cashier to the cooks to I don't know who else with a red shirt and red cap. It was slow at the time, but I counted at least 8 employees behind the counter. Pretty normal though for a brand new joint as they're expecting a rush the first few weeks.

I ordered the cheeseburger (comes with two patties) with mayo, mustard and tomatoes. For those new to five guys, their toppings are free and they better be given their pricey items lol. Their burgers are indeed 100% beef so no artificial crap is added. Also, the more natural, the juicier the burger is in my opinion. It was indeed juicy and the toppings were fresh. BUT...

I won't give 5 stars because I feel like $9.36 for a cheeseburger (yes, two patties, but they were on the smaller side) and a bottle of water is a little too much. When the nice cashier rang me up, I had to be sure that they didn't mistakenly include fries as part of my order. They do of course have ""little hamburgers"" as well that come with a single patty. 

It's nice, clean and spacious in the inside. There have been a few businesses in this shopping center that have come and gone so it'll be interesting to see what the future holds for this five guys location.

"Why 5 stars? Because creating a business out of edible cookie dough is basically as genius as it gets.

   ---   ---   ---

I've been to a couple of the other locations and continue to be impressed. Cookie dough is one of the greatest tasting substances on Earth, but there's always the risk of hurting yourself from eating too much raw egg. The fact that someone invented 100% safe cookie dough with no raw egg just proves to me that we're living in the best version of society that's ever existed. 

And to pair it with ice cream just to shake up the texture? Bless you sir or madam who came up with this.

I opted for the cookie monster ice cream and sugar cookie, cookie dough. I don't know what the exact flavor was for cookie monster, but it was described to taste like icing on a cake. That description was very accurate. It was delicious. And the cookie dough was as amazing as it always is.

"I was meeting some friends for an early mid-week dinner in Ybor City, and was able to skip out of work early that day. Since I had about an hour to kill, I wandered over to GameTime in Centro Ybor at the corner of 8th Avenue and 17th Street to blast the crap out of some aliens before dinner.

GameTime is an arcade attraction filled with video games, multiplayer games, ride-simulators, and the opportunity to win tickets that can be cashed in for prizes. There's also a restaurant with a full bar inside, and in the evening this place gets crazy busy with teens and mouthy Ybor d-bag toads. But during the day this is serious geek Heaven for those of us who need to get in our shoot-em-up Terminator fix.

GameTime is brightly-colored, noisy, and a heck of a lot of fun if you enjoy these type of arcade game places. I checked out various video games that let me take out my frustrations on aliens and zombies and a criminal who looked surprisingly like a former boss. It's the simple things in life that give me so much pleasure.  :-)

I wandered around the inside, looking over the place, and watching the people having fun, before settling in front of one of the video terminals with my official alien blaster weapon to gleefully mow down an army of blood-sucking reptiles. Die you scumbags!!!! Muhahahaha! 

Before too long it was time to walk over to the restaurant and meet my friends, so I handed my string of tickets to the guy next to me who was struggling to kill the aliens. After a quick fist-bump and nod of respect, the guy was back to blasting away with his gun with some new-found confidence. My work here is done!

Pricey juices but they have a recycling program like Fruitwood Standup Market.  $0.50 back per bottle returned to them. Unlike FSM though, they've started a punch card for the juices (excluding juice teas). It would be nice it they offered smaller sizes of the juices though (like FSM does). $8-9 per bottle is pretty steep. 
The Kale Quinoa Salad has a lot of good flavor. Not too sweet, not bland at all. Plus it's main ingredients are two amazing-for-you foods!
The Market Slaw is lightly dressed and super crunchy. Apples, cabbage, carrots- great stuff!

It's taco Tuesday, so I definitely understand they don't have everything on the menu given they sell a lot. They actually had nothing I went there for, yet I ordered different items to taste....I was already there...had been in a long line. 
I asked for a Aguas Frescas and was told they had none. 
When they called my order number and I approached to pick up they were taking an order and the customer asked for Aguas Fresca. They offered him 3 flavors to choose from. 
I told the young lady that when I asked for the drink I was told they had none and a man comes out saying no! that was pre-ordered! He told me that they had called it in. No it was not pre-ordered! No they had not called it in!
The couple arrived after I did, they were talking about what to order while in line and placed the order then and there!
So señor, not true! No es cierto! No mienta! 
I told him that No, it's not pre-ordered, they ordered just now. I saw the concern and some level of embarrassment in the females taking the orders. 
I told them: That is wrong! That is no way of doing business, you cannot serve some customers appropriately and choose to treat others differently.

"So, I am giving a restaurant with a 3 star average a 5 star review on Yelp.  Wanna hear why?  Well, it is because this was the best pork sandwich that I have EVER had.  Not even joking around.

We were heading up to Carrollwood for some errands on a Saturday and I suggested Dale 1891 as I have seen it and been curious in the past.  After reading the Yelp reviews I was hesitant but said ""what the hey!""  We were literally the only people there so I really can't talk about the service when it's crowded.  But we definitely had all of their attention.

Onto the food.  So I'm now obsessed with this pork sandwich.  It is pulled pork cooked in a vinegar type sauce topped with asian style slaw, also infused with vinegar.  Add in freshly pickled jalapenos and onion straws.  Slap on a side of hand cut fries.  Seriously, I shouldn't have eaten the whole thing but I did and I have no regrets.  Will I be back?  Yes.  Will I order the exact same thing?  Yes.",13,A,Dale 1891,Dale 1891,dale 1891,5.0,POSITIVE

This time I had the Husbeast. and he is an avid consumer of all things HOT and spicy.  This was a good match. Jessi was awesome. She allowed him to sample each sauce, telling him about the components behind them and even offered some to me. Sharing with  me a brownie bite that was decadent and made with her blueberry ginger sauce.

1.Front desk blonde Cuban lady is rude. She looks so miserable at her job and she's working with customers. Please atleast fake a smile.

"Small, trendy interior. Lovely wait staff!! Very small menu but that doesn't stop the food from being amazing! I was disappointed when the waitress told me they don't do substitutions. I don't eat pork so I couldn't have 4 out of the 5 ramen bowls they had. 

I chose the veggie bowl and added some extras to my liking. I also ordered the chicken karaage. The karaage was very crispy and nicely salted. The sauce that accompanied the karaage was amazing! It added a nice spicy kick to the dish, I just wish there was more of it, like a lot more!! As for the ramen, it had amazing flavor. However, I ordered the extra spicy sauce and it wasn't spicy at all. I also ordered shrimp as an extra and the dish only had two pieces of shrimp in it. Not too big of a compliant since a ramen bowl is always crowded. 

Now for the bad - the only thing I can really complain about was the heat. It was ridiculously hot in this restaurant. And for hot ramen soup to be a featured dish it really makes dining here very uncomfortable. It was so hot sweat was literally rolling down my back. I couldn't enjoy my dining experience and had to take my ramen to go after just two bites. (I finished the rest as soon as I got home)

"The good reviews for this place seriously have me questioning credibility. My husband and I live within walking distance so we've given this place a fair amount of chances to be great. 3 exactly. 

1st: Husband and I ordered 3 bagel balls. Couldn't even bite into them because they were rock hard. SO very apparent these were left over from the day before. The bagel balls are the price of a whole bagel anywhere else, so to be old, is a slap in your customers face. 

Second visit: wanted to try the place again with a friend. 
We had a Nutella croissant, pumpkin muffin, and chocolate chip cookie. 

The cookie was CLEARLY old. Can you not make fresh cookies???  *****agonizing sigh*****

The Nutella croissant was awful. The texture was all wrong, there were no light and crisp layers, and the Nutella tasted burnt. How is the Nutella burnt, but the inside of the croissant is under-baked?  HOW SWAY?There was old powdered sugar on the croissant. Dare I say, again, I've overpaid for old ""fresh"" pastries. 

Onto the pumpkin muffin.  Absolutely foul. I don't know why I ordered a pumpkin muffin at this time of year, so I blame myself.  There were two layers of glaze. One layer was fresh.  One layer was not.  Gross.

Basicallyyyyy, We spent $12 for a muffin, a cookie, and a croissant and they were all OLD. And you throw it in my face by giving me a muffin with VISIBLY different layers of glaze. 

3rd visit:  My husband brought home breakfast sandwiches for an easy morning. 
I was over the pastries by this time but was willing to try the sandwiches. 
MUCH to my surprise, but not really, my bread was moldy. Lovely. After taking two bites of the freezer burnt bread and slimy spinach, I saw the mold. 

Absolutely done. I am baffled as to how people are frequenting this sad excuse for an establishment.

"My wife and I frequented PF Changs often when they opened this location. I would consider the menu to be Asian fusion.  Food overall is ok, but definitely not as flavorful as you might expect. May be why we're do not dune here as often. 
 
Either way, we usually start with wonton soup, which has chicken, shrimp and wontons (not everyone will like this dish).

Main courses are Changs spicy chicken, Mapo Tofu, and Mongolian beef.

Changs spicy chicken is not very spicy and oftentimes is more like sweet and sour chicken.  This is fine since our daughter loves it.  Last couple of times the chicken had a weird chewy texture?

The Mongolian beef is good especially with the large green onions/scallions.  However, beware of being overcooked as this will make the beef very chewy.

My wife loved the mapo tofu until I learned to make it at home and now we are left unimpressed by the PF Chang version.  I still like the PFC version too, but definitely not spiced like the home version.  For you vegetarians out there, you may like this dish quite a bit. 

No disrespect, but the food is ""watered down"" and inconsistent (different chefs?). Some of this has to do with how dishes are seasoned, both for saltiness and spice.  I get they have to tone it down based on the wide range of people they serve, but sometimes it can be bland. 

Overall service is generally good, but the lighting is definitely on the dark side.  If you're having lunch, the glare outside will make you squint a bit.   Keep in mind many of the dishes are large and can be shared.

"The highlight was definitely the salsa bar. I've seen Mexican restaurants with a wide array of free hot sauces, but this was the first time I've seen a place offer ten free homemade salsas to eat with your meal. Fantastic!

While I was checking out the salsas, Rene, the owner, came over to discuss the different salsas with me and even showed me in the back where the salsas were being prepared from fresh grilled tomatoes; he emphasized how they are using the freshest ingredients possible. My favorite was the peanut salsa--a delicious degree of spiciness. 

I'm training for a race, so I've had to cut way back on what I eat. I ordered a grilled chicken (pollo asado) burrito and ate half of it. Very, very tasty! I was with a party of about a dozen people and everyone seemed to really enjoy their meals. I think 10 of the 12 people had to get to-go boxes because the portions were too big for one meal. (That's a good thing!)

I confirmed with Rene that a Taco Bus will soon be opening in St Pete and it will be modeled after the Bus in Seminole Heights. There will be both outdoor and indoor (air conditioned!!) seating. He said that if everything runs on schedule, the new Taco Bus should be opening this November. This was my first time to meet Rene, and he seemed like a really good and humble guy. When I asked him how he made the Bus so popular, he simply said that he had been very blessed. Now there's a good guy!

Overall, Taqueria Monterrey is a great little Mexican restaurant.

At this point, I had still not received my order (after multiple calls) and listened to them saying that my order was ""5-8 mins away"" so I cannot report on how the pizza tastes, but the service is unbelievably bad, and I would never recommend this to anybody. Eventually, after almost 3 total hours of waiting, el patron called and said that ""the pizza will be delivered in 5 minutes"". 10 mins later, Grubhub called me and said that that el patron had cancelled the order and closed for the day. Never, NEVER EVER ORDER FROM HERE. I would rate a 0 if possible",18,B,El Patron Pizzeria,El Patron Pizzeria,el patron pizzeria,1.0,NEGATIVE

"This is a new Thai restaurant in South Tampa, and while I think it has a lot of potential (and I'm so happy that this restaurant has opened so close to me), it's got a way to go.

We ordered: the blanket shrimp, the egg rolls, edamame, tom yum gai, two kids chicken noodle soups, massaman beef curry, and drunken noodles with pork and shrimp. We also got a couple Singha beers, and I got a Thai iced coffee.

The drinks and appetizers arrived quickly. The beer was correctly cold. The iced coffee was a little weak but the flavor was good.  The appetizers were good. I liked the hint of ginger in the blanket shrimp and egg rolls. The edamame was a little undersalted, but it was fine. 

The soup came out next. The kids loved their soup. I found the tom yum to be a little too sweet for my taste.

Around the time the soup arrived, a huge bolus of people showed up. We finished our soup and noticed that the people around us were all waiting for food. After a while, the kids started acting restless, so we asked the server to wrap up the rest of our food to eat later. My husband ate all of the noodles without sharing, so I cannot comment on them, but I can say that the massaman curry (ordered American spicy) was correctly spicy and tasted good (but not quite as good as mine or my mother's!). 

We ate on a Friday night, but we arrived before six. Service was fine until around 7, when the restaurant filled up and the servers and kitchen became overwhelmed. 

I know that staffing is tough right now, so I'll try Pinto Thai again in a month or so. Hopefully they'll have ironed out their kinks by then and/or hired more staff.

"I stopped in here on Mother's Day for some take out. First thing I was told is that it's vegetarian. I'm ok with that so I asked about menu for some take out. The ladies stopped eating their lunch to help me with out hesitation. The owner kindly explained to me what was in what, what was popular and how much food I would need for a group of 5. I got a lot of food ordered for about 40! The ladies made it fresh and the entire process took about 30 min. I did have to run to an atm since there card reader was down but it happens. The owner and main cook was so nice she threw in some extras like yogurt soup and little desserts for us to try.
I asked for somewhat spicy and surprised that it actually was unlike so many places that are afraid to spice it up. I needed that yogurt soup to cool my mouth from the lentils that were yummy and spicy. My favorite was the Samosas though they were just amazing. We didn't care for the desserts but she threw those in for us to try. If you want something other than the norm cooked fresh by very nice people give this place a try.

"Am staying at the Marriott which houses the Blue Bistro.  Didn't want to venture out and wasn't in the mood for something big for dinner, so decided to give it a try.  It's a medium to large venue for a hotel restaurant with over 16 seats at the bar, high tops on the perimeter of the bar and traditional seating in the restaurant area.  It was rather busy both at the bar and in the dining section.  I opted for one of the high-tops as they have a number of TVs in the bar area with a variety of sports / news on. Even though it was fairly busy, the bartender quickly greeted me and took my drink and food order.  Wanting something lite, I ordered the Cobb salad.  It arrived quickly and was a nice portion size.  Greens were fresh and crisp and the chicken cooked well.  Flavorful overall.

"For what it is I like it. I appreciate the toasting of the sandwich. I like the tuna salad more than subways, but less than Publix. They have way less topping options than  most sandwich places but Since this is the only one I have been to I don't know if that is because the airport location or the chain in general. 

I put Dijon mustard, lettuce (ask for more), tomatoes, and Italian seasoning on my tuna. Only half of the smash which gets toppings so I are the side without them first and saved the topping side  for last. I like that they cut the sandwich in half so it is easier to eat. 

My hubby definitely ordered better than I did as the salad looks really good and it has lots of meat on it for him to enjoy.

"Loved this ""Deutsch"" place!  It has only 4.5 booths and decorated in bright red.  Loved that the plates were ceramic, not paper or styro.  The full dinners run about $10, I was lightly hungry so got the pork schnitzel burger for $5.  They brought 3 slices of a good German bread out to nibble on. It was delish.  It was a great sandwich but they over did the catsup and mustard for my taste and I'll order on the side next time.  They overenthusiastically removed my plate when they saw the sandwich gone and I'd have liked to have finished the little salad and bits that fell out of the sandwich.  I took some red cabbage to go and can't wait to try it.  I wish the desserts were on display  (none on chalkboard and none visible in case) or that I saw the breads or pretzels.  I'd have bought some. So they might do a better job of advertising and displaying their wares for better sales (or maybe Fridays they don't have them?).  I did witness them take a large order for take-out and then get a call in and change the order so they were a little frenzied for 2 employees.

I've been eyeing Planet Grilled Cheese since their coming soon wall art was prominently displayed. I love greasy yummy grilled cheese! I finally got my chance! We got there right at their lunch rush time, and we had about 10 customers ahead of us. The workers were efficient and as friendly as one could expect with a million hungry customers staring at them. 

I ordered the buffalo chicken grilled cheese with fries and my fiancé ordered the Mac Daddy with mozzarella sticks. The buffalo could definitely use some ranch, but the fries! You know, if it wasn't for fries I would be super fit. I'm in the gym six days a week. I eat fries most days too. It's a weakness. The fries at Planet Grilled Cheese are the things that dreams are made of if you like crispy favorable fries. I'm sitting here in my jammies daydreaming about the next time I'm coming for fries! The Mac Daddy was pretty great too, and the fiancé and I have made a pact to each get something the other would like to try next time so we can mix and match our selections. 

So after all of this, I deducted a star because the price is ridiculous. I could have went to BJ's, had lunch and tipped for the price of the trip to PGC. Yes, upgrading to meals with mozzarella sticks is definitely going to be an upcharge, but $30. For two grilled cheese meals. I'm still a huge fan, but it is quite pricey for fast food.

"Up until recently, I've actually had a huge aversion to food trucks, but that has certainly changed.  It may have been the fact that at my first job out of high school, folks called the truck that swung by the ""roach coach.""  Conversely, it may be my binge watching of food network and their Food Truck Rally that has changed my mind.  Either way, I'm very pleased with the fact that I've begun exploring these great little mobile sources of food pleasure. 

This food truck swung by work recently, and I have to admit I'm a bit of a noob when it comes to Middle East cuisine.  The young woman taking the order was very patient and explained all the different plates, the variations available, and what came on each.  Her top recommendation came for the beef shawarma and I told her I'd take it.  

One thing that folks have to realize is that these are mobile kitchens with very limited space.  In today's age of fast food that seems to be sitting under a food warmer and being prepared long before you order, there is an unrealistic expectation that a food truck will spit your order out in a minute or two.  I played on my phone for a while and was delighted when my name was called.  The meat was perfectly seasoned and there was no skimping on the portions.  The liberal amount of sauce on top added to the tastiness (and most definitely the messiness) of this dish. 

I'm hoping this food truck comes back soon.  Not only for a chance to try some other of their tasty dishes, but also because of the friendliness of the woman at the window, and for how (relatively) quickly my food was served.",27,B,Kebablicious,Kebablicious,Kebablicious Inc.,4.0,POSITIVE
"Arepitas is a cute little Venezuelan/Lebanese Cafe located near the USF area. My Yelp brother from another mother, Jason C and my friend Dorene M, decided on this restaurant prior to a Yelp event at Busch Gardens.

The staff was friendly here and there were three people working but only one behind the counter. Jeremiah was very friendly and took time to explain all my food options, but I felt awful because a line was starting to form and he was the only one behind the counter.

You can choose to have your meal served in an arepa or a pita. I found this concept to be fascinating  since I had never seen Venezuelan and Lebanese cuisine paired together. 

I wanted something different so I settled on the Venezuelan Arepa with black beans, pulled beef, and white cheese. I had the fried plantains served on the side and not in the arepa. I get creeped out by mixing sweet and salty.  The food was delicious and was definitely a bigger portion than I had imagined. The arepa (as you can see in the picture) was stuffed full.

I'm a 25 year old dude in a band, so i'm not one to spend $17 (after tax) on a meal, but everything sounded so good, and the cashier had great recommendations. What I received was not a $17 meal, nor even a $7 meal. 

The portion was so small, the food didn't even take up a quarter of the to go container. The rice and veggies were soggy, and everything tasted as if it were a frozen meal they had just microwaved. The additional avocado I ordered was old and soggy as well.

"5  stars because - COVID-19 has hit everyone hard, especially small businesses, probably even more so than large corporate businesses. So when I see a new mom and pop (they're a young couple) trying to do some good by offering people what they can't do with out... food!

That's what brought me there, I needed some and my Yelp! reviews have been in the flusher lately because there's just no need to risk life over a few moments of recreation.

Anyway, I took plenty of pictures of the outside before I went in and met one of the owners although I forgot to get her name. The restaurant was clean and well maintained which is always a bonus. We talked about the items on the menu and how the restaurant has been doing in spite of COVID and even the riots. I was glad that they've been surviving both.  The special they had today was a Gyro and 5 wings, I got that and chose the Sweet Thai Chili flavor for my wings. Looking at the menu, the loaded chili cheese fries got my attention also so of course I got those too.

They have a smaller sized Coca-Cola Freestyle fountain drink dispenser so cherry sprite was available. My food didn't take long and smelled amazing. The owner recommended the chicken sandwich the next time I visit (there WILL be a next time).

Fast forward to the first bites... the Gyro - my first bite didn't stop until the it was gone. They give you this secret sauce to go in it and although I don't know all of what's in it, it was on POINT! - 5 stars for that.

The wings... Everyone can cook wings but NOT everyone can get them right. A great wing is crispy on the outside while leaving the meat tender and flavorful on the inside. Done right, your wings will build a following for your restaurant even if nothing else does... There wings make the grade because I'm a wing aficionado and I've been many places and tried many different styles of wings and even places that have WINGS in their name have failed to make the grade, Southern Fry gets 5 stars for their wings... Get Some!

Lastly it is as the loaded chili cheese fries. I loved them, the spicy peppers were a hit, the fries were loaded down and soggy. They were light and crispy just like they're supposed to be.

"This place has a four star rating on Yelp? This has to be a mistake, I mean let's get real. Service was so-so, the establishment wasn't the most inviting, and the food... Well let's just say it was lacking to say the least.

Ordered the crawfish roll, tuna bowl, chicken teriyaki, Toro and Miso soup. Of all the dishes  only the Miso stands out. 

The Tuna Bowl was sloppy, nothing close to the bowl you get at a Ciccio Cali. The chicken teriyaki was nothing special, tasted like cafeteria food to be honest, a grilled chicken with cheap tasting teriyaki sauce. The Toro was horrible, I get that it's fatty but this was so gummy and chewy that it made it inedible.  The crawfish roll was lacking freshness and flavor.

So my advice to Sushi Yaki is to first lower their prices, the food not worth the cost, not even close. Take a look at ciccio cali and mimic what they do.",11,A,Sushi Yaki,Sushi Yaki,Sushi Yaki,1.0,NEGATIVE

If you're looking at the Matcha Pebbles Churro and hoping to get more matcha flavor, you'll be disappointed. It is mainly fruity pebble with matcha glaze. Matcha flavor is very mild and subtle. 

We love the Mangonadas but flavor is not as strong as an authentic one. We also got a few of the drinks and The Pink Flamingo Green Tea is so good! Other drinks like salted cream green tea, strawberry twist, etc. are okay. 

Shaken beef garlic noodles tend to be more on the oily and salty side.

"It has been approximately 10 months since my last review and this one is no better than the last. I walked into my location around 7:30pm and placed my order. I noticed that it looked like they were either behind on orders while trying to fill a large order or just not moving at a steady pace. I waited about 15 mins before I received my food. I always check it prior to leaving and thank goodness I did because it was cold. I went back up to the counter and let the cashier know and she said they would correct it. Had to wait a few more mins and was given back my food. I checked it again and come to find out they put my same steak back on the grill and still gave me back the same cold rice and potatoes I had before. Is this a thing because that doesn't seem very sanitary even more so with everything going on. Smh at this point I'm extremely frustrated because why would you only correct half of my order and not the whole thing ? At this point this service was unacceptable and all I wanted was hot food because that's what I paid for. I asked for a managers number/customer service number and it was given to me as I again had to wait for my food to be remade. I had to request that my food be made completely over because they kept passing my plate back and forth and I found that quite disturbing. I left around 7:40pm and still had to go home and warm up my food. Some of the rice was so hard I thought I was gonna chip my tooth. My potatoes lacked flavor, and my steak was tough. Highly disappointed in the way my situation was handled tonight. I usually eat here at least 2x a week and never have this problem(maybe because I come earlier in the day) but it looks like I might need to find a new favorite.

"To start off with the lady at the frog was incredibly rude. My partner asked a question and she quickly shot him down with a ""no"" before he could finish. We sat down and no one came to the table for 10 minutes. There was about 6 waitresses and about 4 tables seated. The food was awful! The bacon was disgusting, the waffles were cold and hard ! The only thing not messed up was the fruit, but how do you even mess up fruit?! 
As we were ready for the check my partner asked the lady at the front what we do with it since our room came with the breakfast included. She snatched the pen from my partners hand (LITERALLY) and she wrote down a X, and said ""they know what to do"" so she left but then came back and wrote some kind of code down at the bottom. We then left, I walked out first and said a nice good bye to her. She didn't say anything until another couple came right behind me and she said ""goodbye!"" to them so happily.

No flavor, no garlic and just oil.  Off to the cheese fries which were in edible.  They tasted like old grease, twice cooked or something funky going on.

"Italian done right! I am new to the area and was concerned about finding a ""go to"" restaurant since Italian is a family favorite. I booked reservations for NYE and was pleasantly surprised. The atmosphere I'm sure was a little louder due to the holiday and DJ. But once we got beyond that the food was nothing short of amazing. From the pepper crusted filet to the short rib risotto, each entree was a home run. The appetizers were on point. I love the bruschetta trio (one grapes saturated with honey, sounded odd but was one of favorite), I do think they should offer the traditional bruschetta as full appetizer, I think it would benefit them since its really good. The wait staff seemed a little distracted and not as attentive as one would think, theres grace since it was a holiday. Manager was very kind, stop by to check in as we were heading out and thank us for coming. This place is solid.

"I rarely go here because it's so fattening, but every time I take my sick cats to Avalon Vet Clinic next door, I have to fight to not go in.  I love Stephanno's food and I gave in last week.  I was only going to get a pizza slice, but ended up getting a take out portion of the meatballs and spaghetti sauce, too.   She was so sweet.  They only had a plain cheese pizza on the rack, but when I said I was looking for a pizza with lots of veggies on it (and a bit of pepperoni), she made a slice especially for me.  It was beyond what I would have expected, including kale/spinach, fresh mushrooms, onions, peppers etc.  Of course the spaghetti and meatballs were eaten right after the delicious pizza.  

As another person mentioned, it is definitely a take-out place because it is run-down/grimey (sorry).  But as I mentioned to the lady behind the counter, unlike other people, I don't shop with my eyes.  Like with Avalon, I trust the vet's expertise and don't mind that the waiting room is a little run down, the same is true with this pizza place.   I don't care what it looks like if the food is good.  I paid all of $9 for both the large pizza slice and the ""side portion/appetizer"" meatballs and sauce.

Such a fun place, upbeat atmosphere and the customers actually meant something to the staff.

"I nornally don't go to MCD/BK unless I am going on a road trip to Miami or ATL. However, there were 2 items I was interested in trying.

This BK is one of the newer style ones from 2016. The restaurant was clean and the customer service was friendly. I got my order within 5 minutes. There is an electronic soda machine , but it was out of many flavors .

Impossible Whopper - This burger costs $5.50 (I believe a standard whopper is $4.30). It is made of soy and potato oil/sunflower oil. No meat is present at all. It has lettuce/pickles/tomato/ketchup like a standard whopper. It tastes pretty close to the whopper but not quite. I have to give Impossible food credit for that. The closest thing I feel  the taste is similar to is Boca Burgers from Publix/Walmart. It doesn't feel as substantial as a regular burger though. Nutrition wise, it is mostly the same with it being 30 calories less and 1 gram of sugar more and 1 gram of fat less or thereabouts. So overall, one shouldn't be eating this to eat healthy or lose weight. The carbon foot print /environment is the greatest benefactor.  I would recommend this for people who don't beef for religious reasons who are in a crunch with limited options.   3.25/5

BK Taco - I can't believe I'm saying this but this makes a Taco Bell standard taco look like Salma Hayek.  The taco shell is crisp but only at the top near the opening and the bottom is soft and shriveled up. The ""beef"" is some amorphous compound that is worse than TB beef. It has cheese and lettuce but is minimal. Not worth the $1.    2/5",31,C,Burger King,Burger King,Burg3r King,3.0,NEGATIVE

They didn't forget anything, but the distribution could have been better. Items needed to be spread out more and a couple slices had none or barely any of one or two toppings. It tasted alright. 

The chicken alfredo was ok. The chicken was good. Sauce was bland. A little home doctoring and it was fine. They give you a large portion and it comes with a salad and a couple of garlic knots. The knots were bland as well. No butter or parmesan. 

The veggie roll was good. No complaints.

The hot wings are another story. The only complement that I can give them is that they were cooked. I checked the block for hot on the order and these were anything but. Not sure if they had sauce at all. We had to add our own. 

The cheese sticks and battered mushrooms were ok.

It's not often that La Chica and I even eat sweets, but we had just finished up a sodium-laced meal across the way at Zen and Urban Swirl is new, so we figured ""What the hell?""  

We had the caramel and vanilla swirl and also the cake batter and pumpkin swirl.  Both were very creamy and good, especially the pumpkin.  I think we both got a kick out of the toppings bar.  We saw some stuff in there we've never seen before like boba in multiple flavors and caramel turtles.

Prices might be a little high, I'm not sure.  Since I don't get out to yogurt joints often, I can't mentally compare the prices.  What I can tell you is that our little bowl of magic was about 3/4 full and it the cost was just under $5.

2nd time ordering food and it's awesome! Indian food in tampa is pretty weak outside of a few select spots (1-2 max come in mind) and in new tampa has been traditionally horrendous the last 10+ years we have lived here. So glad to have a place we have finally go to with great food. We have been running the list on the menu with great success but even sweeter is the owner's recommendations on what is really great today. He did not steer us wrong.

"I've driven by this place several times and always wondered what the food was like. Decided to stop in and I'm so glad that I did. I decided to have a Cuban sandwich and a Cuban espresso. The Cuban sandwich was very good. I'm a big fan of them and I'm always looking for a tasty Cuban. A lot of times they use very bland, cheap lunch meat. But this sandwich had very tasty very yummy meat. And she buttered the top of the bread which made it extra tasty. And I love a good Cuban coffee. I don't often find them as tasty as this one was. It was just the right amount of sweet. Not too little not too much.

It's a little hole-in-the-wall place but it's very clean-looking and the service was good. The people that I met in there were very nice everyone was talking to me. When I first arrived it was just a few customers in there and they said the owner would be right back. Evidently, she had ran out of grits and this couple really wanted them so she went to the store and got some more. When I got back one of the lady said to her in Spanish that I was a newbie.

"Being the first to review this location, I'm somewhat honored.

My wife and I arrived at approximate. 2 PM Sunday afternoon. There was no waiting, we were seated right away. Actually, they had plenty of tables open. We were there because I got a gift card for Christmas. Until then, I had never eaten at a Ruby Tuesday's.

Our waitresses name was Alysa. Friendly for the most part. Not the fasted server I've ever had but not the worst. 

We started with the Four Way Sampler. It comes with chicken tenders, buffalo wings, southwest egg rolls & cheese sticks. Neither my wife or myself care for southwest egg rolls so we asked if we could substitute for more chicken tenders. Somehow the server did not understand what my objective was and we ended up with a FULL order of chicken tenders as well as the Four Way. More about that later.......

My wife ordered the Salmon with garlic mashed potatoes and mac & cheese. I ordered the ""classic"" BBQ ribs (full rack) along with fries and the mac & cheese. The mac & cheese is considered a ""premium"" side item so they charge $1 more but I thought, why not?

The chicken tenders were really good as well as the wings and cheese sticks. I wouldn't mind going in on a Friday after work and just ordering the sampler and a drink.

Finally the meal came out. The ribs were plentiful. I was concerned as they charge about $20 for a full rack. That is pretty steep compared to other places but if they was a large portion, I would be happy with that aspect. Now the quality - they were done nicely with just the right amount of sauce. The sauce actually was sticky to the ribs which is just how I like them. The flavor was there as well. 

As far as the fries - they were basic fries. Didn't seem like they had any seasonings on them. McDonald's are 100 times better. The mac & cheese on the other hand I did not like. It was very greasy and had a bad after taste to it. I did mention that to my server and the extra $1 was taken off my bill. 

About the bill.......when it arrived there was a charge for $8 for an order of chicken tenders. I inquired why it was listed and my server said it was for the extra tenders during the appetizer. I informed her that we just wanted to SUB the Southwest rolls for extra tenders. There was a communication problem somewhere. The server did seem  empathetic and talked to her manager. That charge came off the bill as well. It would have been a nice gesture to have seen the manager but no one ever came over.

Overall it was just OK. I wouldn't go back for a meal but like I said earlier, maybe an appetizer and drinks.",30,C,Ruby Tuesday,Ruby Tuesday,Ruby Tuesday,2.0,POSITIVE

"This is the restaurant we have visited sometime ago and finally I have sometime to write about it. Havana 86 is the restaurant may be open during pandemic. We visited two months ago. I like the restaurant because it has good Cuban cuisine. Especially this area has already many Cuban restaurants close. I am happy they open their door. 

We started with Tostones Rellenos - stuff fried green plantain. We got the stuffing at lobster. It comes with 5 pieces and delicious to share. For the main course, we have Vaca Frita and Churrasco ala Cubana. The vaca frita can be a little crispy by pan grilled longer. The skirt steak is delicious.

Before anything, I don't live here and this is my first, (and last) time at Sula's... the place had the most BRUTAL burnt-oil-fryer smell, I got a cuban to-go and literally had to wait outside on the street.  The 2 minutes it took me to order, and pickup the food after my wait was enough to stink up my clothes, and hotel room with the same brutal oil smell.  I kid you not, This was the most powerful frying oil smell i've ever encountered, truly borderline toxic.

Although one burger came cooked medium when it was asked for rare, it didn't take away from the taste and he still enjoyed it, thoroughly.

We split two desserts, the apple tartlet and the poached pear.  The pear was tasty, with a cinnamon custard drizzled on top.  I preferred the mini apple tartlet.  The pastry was divine, flaky and buttery.  A great end to the meal.

"My husband noticed this place when he was getting coffee at Starbucks across the street. We decided to give it a try.

Chips & Salsa: Salsa was good, but I didn't care for the tortilla chips too much, neither did my husband. 

Breaded Chicken Wings: My husband was hesitant at first, because he doesn't like breaded wings, but he really liked these and so did I. They are coated with a thin layer of breading and had a nice little crunch, not your typical breaded wings. These are not hot wings.

Fajitas: My husband ordered the fajitas, he really liked them. He said the flour tortillas were excellent and they are very generous with their portions. He's from Central America and is really picky when it comes to Central American food, so if he likes it, they must be doing something right.

Rice & Beans: The rice and beans were good. That's all I can really say about them. Your typical Mexican restaurant rice and beans. I lived in AZ for years, so I know authentic rice and beans and these fall a little short, but still good. 

Tacos: I had two bistek tacos (steak) and one chorizo. The bistek was really good, but the chorizo was a little salty. It had a nice kick to it (I like spicy chorizo), but just a little too salty.

Kid's Nuggets & Fries: My son liked his nuggets and fries. I didn't try them, but they looked like regular 'ole chicken nuggets to me. 

Bunuelo: It's a fried semi sweet pastry (basically a fried flour tortilla) with vanilla ice cream and topped with honey chocolate syrup, whipped cream, and cinnamon. It's a light dessert. I liked the honey chocolate syrup with the ice cream, but the pastry had a bit of a greasy aftertaste. My husband said he didn't get the aftertaste I did, but he did have a lot of ice cream with his piece of pastry, so maybe it masked the aftertaste?

"GREAT WINGS..... ! 

OK now here is the thing, if you are a bar owner and you drink to the point of being a problem for your employees and your customers -- WELL -- SHAME ON YOU !!! Not only will you lose customers, and possibly lose damn good bartenders -- you are also drinking up your profits!!! Now how absolutely stupid is that?

I am sure if you go to bars, you have seen an owner or two pretty messed up.
Sometimes it can be a good time had by all -- but many times it can be just downright awful. Especially when the owner gets drunker and drunker. Then gets louder and louder, then gets meaner and meaner or just down right obnoxious !!! Maybe the drunk bar owner gets way to carried away flirting with customers to the point of embarrassment for all.

"Pretty darned good tacos out of a food truck on Kennedy.

I'm always on the lookout for a new taco place. Tacos El Borracho looked promising as previous Yelpers indicated that they have lamb barbacoa tacos. 

I ordered a barbacoa taco, a lengua taco, and a carnitas taco. I also ordered a small horchata. The food was ready within 8 minutes, which was very fast for a food truck. They take cash, but they also take credit card now.

Alas, the barbacoa was definitely beef (my takeout container was marked ""res""). It was pretty good, but (and I can't believe I'm saying this) there was too much meat. The ratio was off, and with so much meat, there were bites that didn't have enough cilantro or onion or salsa. The lengua was pretty good (maybe a little underseasoned), but lengua almost always is good. The carnitas was fine, but again, I feel that there was too much meat.

Tacos are served on store-bought tortillas. They are pretty good tortillas (they don't need to double tortilla here), but they still aren't homemade. For $3 a taco, that's not very impressive. Tacos come with lime, cilantro and onion as default, and they have the typical red and green salsitas. I liked the red more than the green, which is usual for me, but in this case, the green was too watery and bland.

The horchata was pretty generic. Maybe it came from a mix?

All in all, this is not a destination taco place for me. It's still better than 90% of the taco places in Tampa, but I think there are much better places to get a taco, often for less money and with homemade tortillas.",0,A,Tacos El Borracho,Tacos El Borracho,Tac0s El B0rrach0,4.0,POSITIVE

We waited 40 minutes for out to sandwiches to arrive.  That's a ridiculous amount of time to have to wait for a sandwich.

"Barbecue has many different styles depending on what region of the US that you grew up in. Its kinda like karate-Ryu, Ken and Akuma practice ansatsuken, while Dan advocates a saikyo style, and Ryo,Yuri, and Robert Garcia train in kyokugen.

So, I cant comment on the accuracy of the food at 4 rivers, only my opinion of the taste.

Over the last few months, there seems to be an onslaught of people rushing to 4Rivers, and porklaiming (not a typo) it the next coming of Monica Bellucci.

I have never eaten at a Barbecue restaurant in Tampa. Outside of my mom preparing some occasionally at home, I dont really eat any Q

4 Rivers is located in a plaza with Youfit Fitness and Devita Dialysis (an ominous portent about my triglycerides perhaps?) on Dale Mabry  just south of the Bearss intersection.

The decor is sort of contemporary cafeteria with some neat 2 bladed fans with pulleys. There are metallic chairs along long wooden tables. I came at a light time on a weekday afternoon This is probably only the second restaurant that has a very communal feeling;you will be in kissing distance with your dining compeers on busy weekends.   Perpendicular to the main line for ordering is a ""Sweet Shop"" with oodles of confections.    I admit that I dont really think sweets when thinking of meat, but an interesting idea nonetheless.

Reading many reviews, I decided to order Burnt Ends dinner plate with some Texas Sausage a la carte, and smoked Jalapenos, Smokehouse Corn, Bread pudding, and a biscuit as sides.

My thoughts:

Burnt Ends:  Holy Hippo Spit!   This was excellent. It is a mix of brisket and pork burnt yet soft. Sweet yet spicy. I was inhaling it into my mouth like Kim Kardashian does on any night of the week. It becomes ""Shin Akuma"" levels of brokenness if you add 4 Rivers sweet/spicy sauce.    5/5

Texas Sausage: .  This was smoky and spicy and had was very good. Add the 4rivers sauce for more decadence       4/5

Corn: Probably the best corn that was not on the cob I have ever eaten in my life.
I could probably eat this by itself with out any other items    5/5

Smoked Jalapenos:   Hotter than I was thinking. The jalapeno has cream cheese and is wrapped tightly with bacon. Spicy and epic. Bonus: It looks like a Star Wars space ship.                                                 5/5

Biscuit:  Imagine a KFC/Popeye's biscuit, but supercharged with NOS. Big, flaky and filling                                                    4/5

Bread pudding:  This is basically a dessert , but prepared very nicely.  4.5/5


I would like to try the pulled pork and brisket in the future.
The rating teeters towards 4.5. I suppose if you just get the burnt ends/corn/jalapenos, consider my review a 5/5.

The only real negatives are: 

-- 4Rivers is closed on Sundays and it closes early weekdays at 8 pm.

--Even though it is a casual place, the prices are a bit expensive.
I would consider it equal to going to a sit down American chain a la TGI,Red Lobster, etc. 


Also, it is nice that the North Tampa is getting some good restaurants since it is somewhat of a ghost town up here and I don't want to drive to Palma Ceia for good food all the time.

Excellent food! As Arnold is fond of saying, ""I'll be back""",10,A,4 Rivers Smokehouse,4 Rivers Smokehouse,4 Rivers Smokehouse,4.0,NEGATIVE
"My husband has brought home a few of these take and bake pizzas before and I have enjoyed them for what they are. This particular time I went into the store myself and left sorely disappointed.  
The pizza itself was mediocre.  I just assume order a pie from the frozen section at Publix.  In addition, my order was not accurate to my request.   I asked for original, but received a thin-crust instead, but didn't realize it until I had arrived home and unwrapped it from it's plastic wrap.   We ordered the herb chicken Mediterranean. It's served with feta, spinach and sundried tomatoes.   The flavors were fine with our tastes and I could have accepted this blunder as just that.  
However, where my experience spoiled was at the hands of the owner herself.  While placing my order with her at the register, she suggestively sold me on a salad as a side, but when I asked for extra dressing two seconds after my credit card had been processed for payment, she said it would be an additional fifty cents.   I checked my wallet for change and then said never mind. I didn't have any cash or change in my wallet and I honestly  didn't want to process another credit card transaction for $0.50. 
Now I understand product costs and inventory in the restaurant business, so I know it  would not have killed her p&l to just offer me the 2 ounce packet of balsamic dressing since I had already paid.  It just proves that customer service is dead in most establishments.  
I don't think if I'll ever go back to this pizza place.  An owner who cannot empathize with a customer's needs doesn't present very well for a business.",6,A,Papa Murphy's Take 'N' Bake Pizza,Papa Murphy's Take 'N' Bake Pizza,Papa Murphy's Tak3 'N' Bak3 Pizza,1.0,NEGATIVE

On the other side, is for hot pots and Asian BBQ. The tables have grills or hot plates built in. You sit down and someone explains to you the process.  You grab a plate or bowl(make sure to grab an extra) you get meat, fresh veggies or seafood, add some spices or sauce and return to your table.  Then you cook tour own food. The staff will help you. They leave tongs and a spoon to help you. This is where the extra plate comes in, after you've cooked your food, scoop it on a clean plate. Don't over load the grill and try to leave your meat in the middle.  It's a lot of fun!! They bring you some special house sauces and kimchi.  It's all you can eat and they have a wide variety of meats and seafood. Everything is fresh and clean. The staff is helpful and very thoughtful.

"My friend has been telling me about grille 54 for a while and i finally came here for Sunday brunch. This was a post wedding day brunch and we needed a good food after a night of partying. We had a large party of 12 and they were able to accommodate us. I like how they offer a variety of drinks for brunch not just mimosas. They have sangria, margarita, mimosas etc...

The brunch was about $35 and they added gratuity on for the large party. I ended up paying about $50. I am not sure if this buffet measures up though for the cost. I would really like to give them a 3.5 for this point but I decided to round up instead of down. The food is good and the service was good. 

They have a good selection of food but they could have more for the price. Just comparing it to similar buffets with a lower price point I pay $15 less overall for more food with drinks included. The desserts and salad options could be more. They only had one type of sushi as well.

I think it's worth it to check it out for yourself though. I did have a nice meal but my suggestion is add more variety of food.",10,A,Grille 54,Grille 54,Grille 54,4.0,POSITIVE

"My friends and I went a few weeks ago on a slow week night shortly after the big opening.
If you go, be prepared to eat..aLOT.
Each of us foolishly ordered our own and ended up with enough food to feed 8!
Let me give you the run down:
All food is prepared after you order it. This means that there is no giant vat of pre-made macaroni and cheese that is simply tossed with whatever flavor/toppings you select (the preferred method of a few of the places I tried in Los Angeles). The pasta is cooked and tossed in sauce after you order it-- that means you need to be patient and wait a few minutes. I could see this being problematic at a busy lunch hour.
The pasta is also not baked (being made to order), meaning if you are looking for a crackly cheesy crust, this is not your spot. However, it's still ooey gooey delicious so don't be scared.
Between the four of us, we were able to try four different flavors. Be brave! My trusted broccoli cheese pick was actually my least favorite-- bolder flavors were found in the taco or the Italian! I couldn't stop stealing bites from my friends.
We also sampled a few of the wings- baked and not too spicy (aka perfect combo).
Will definitely be back!",35,C,Max & Chz,Max & Chz,Max & Chz,4.0,NEGATIVE

"New York Buffet is a horrible option if you want variety and a clean restaurant. The waitstaff is very rude. My experience was better with family than alone. All the food was cold and old. Especially the seafood.

When I arrived I was quoted one price then I was asked to pay up front which was confusing because not only was a I charged a higher price but I thought you pay after you eat at these establishments. I was told it was more because HE added taxes and gratuities.

So I paid for the buffet upfront without seeing what was being served and I was seated by a central air unit leaking dirty water. My waitress never addressed me or came to visit my table outside of her dropping off a drink while I was getting a plate.

I ended up eating fruit and soup because no  fresh food was out just scraps of what was left out. The food wasn't labeled correctly or at all. There wasn't a good, great or even okay selection.

During my time their I noticed other tables receiving checks.

So I said excuse me to the waitress which she tried so hard to ignore me until she couldn't and I asked her why was I charged up front and everyone else is being charged afterwards. She literally laughed and walked off. She never came back with an answer instead she sat at a table in the front of the restaurant eating her lunch.

At this point I addressed the guy who originally charged me and I asked him can I speak to a manager. He then says ok what happened. He never said yes I am the manager. He never apologized for the service or lack there of. So I asked him why was I charged upfront instead of after my meal. I even told him how his employee laughed when I asked her. And his exact response was because you wanted to pay first. Wow. 

So I left and just called my credit card company to dispute the charge and I also reported them for unsanitary conditions and practices.

And also people leaving 5 stars for this dump had to be high, hungry or an employee because they definitely do not deserve three, four or even five stars.

Again do not eat here. There are other restaurants that deserve your money. New York Buffet gets an F in my book.",24,B,New York Chinese Buffet,New York Chinese Buffet,New Y0rk Chinese Buffet,1.0,NEGATIVE

"I'd never been to a Brazilian steakhouse before and probably would have never gone if my brother hadn't picked it for his birthday dinner. 

There is no menu. Also, no one tells you the price. If you ask for a menu they may bring you a list of the meats they will be serving. There are 17 cuts. Filet mignon, lamb, sirloin, chicken, sausage, pork loin, bacon wrapped filet and chicken, etc.  After you order your drinks you're directed to a large salad bar. It does have some top notch items on it like hearts of palm, sushi, artichokes, meats and cheeses, etc. but it is still a salad bar. I wasn't overly impressed with it. I had considered making my meal just the salad bar (which they didn't mention as an option but other friends had told me was possible) but I didn't think I would be able to get a good meal out of it and I thought I should try the experience. 

It was quite fun having the gauchos come around and slice meat for you at your table. It reminded me of a scene from Robin Hood where a king sits at a table demanding meat. I found this to be my favorite part of the evening. Each guest is given a card that looks like a coaster, one side is red and the other is green. Green = more meat. Red = meat stop. I sampled many types of beef, chicken wrapped in bacon, and Parmesan pork. It was good but I've had better meat elsewhere. Being able to sample a lot of different things is what I found fun about Boizao, not it's meat selection, taste, or quality. 

Along with the salad bar and meat coasters, our table was brought small cheese rolls, mashed potatoes, and fried bananas. All were very nice but not spectacular. The side items, along with everything else, are replenished throughout your meal. 

Our service was top notch. We never wanted for a glass of water, more rolls, meat or anything else. Very impressed with the entire waitstaff. 

The only thing that was not included in the meat buffet was dessert. The dessert selection was nice: key lime pie, snickers cheesecake, chocolate lava cake, sorbet, tiramisu, etc. I only had a bite of my chocolate lava cake since I was full on experiencing the meat sweats by this point but it was fine. Just like any other chocolate lava cake that you could get anywhere else.

"Service was good, and prices were reasonable, which saved this from being a one star. The food was mediocre, at best, and small portions. When I asked if they make their own falafel, they said no. I mean, come on! They don't make their own gyro meat either (it's from Krynos). Which could be fine, but I didn't see more than one small spit cooking either, instead of 2-3 big spits. Likely pre-sliced and heated up on the grill.

Fries frozen, and served cold. Anyone who thinks this food is good has obviously hasn't had decent Greek food (and I lived in Chicago for 6 years, so I know my Greek food). No tahini  sauce either, all tzatsiki. 

Overall, bland chain food masquerading as Greek. Fine if you want something cheap and quick, I guess. We won't be back, though.",16,B,Little Greek Restaurant,Little Greek Restaurant,Little Greek Restaurant Inc.,2.0,NEGATIVE

The topping I specially liked was the  seaweed salad- good texture and good flavor  .  I also liked the  fresh fruit including mango, pineapple, strawberry and blueberry. The orange, red, green tobiko added vivid color to the bowl. Our poke bowl looked pretty and tasted delicious! It was a refreshing and healthy meal for hot summer time.

All in all for the price I know I can get higher quality food in the area for the same price.
There are TVs on the wall which is a very big turn off for me and the place is very noisy. One server didn't speak English and the other touched both myself and my husband on the back multiple times.

The Gobi Manchurian was excellent; the Phal had heat but was still very flavorful, I was a little disappointed with the Baghare Baigan but I know for next time :-)

The white meat in my chicken bowl was good today it was moist but there's a little seasoned rice in the black beans were not drain so it made for a very soggy bowl at the bottom.

"I am seriously wondering why I didn't walk out of this restaurant as soon as I walked in.  That was my first instinct but I figured since it looked crowded it must be good so we decided to give it a try.   The ambiance is confusing in there.  I am not sure what it going on .  They hung some heavy velvet drapes up in some strange places and then just threw in some tables and chairs.  None of the decor made any sense or had any flow to it whatsoever.  
Once I was seated I was still wondering why I was staying since none of the food that was being served looked very good.  But since we had paid the $8 to park we figured let's just try it. 
I ordered the seafood special which was a 6oz filet mignon and 3 shrimp and it had a lump crab cake on top.  It was suppose to come with some sauce but I had that on the side and honestly never even tasted it because it looked like some bbq sauce from a jar.  Dinners come with a side and a salad or soup and I chose the wedge salad.  Again the dressing was from a jar and none of the sauces or dressing were homemade.  The steak was over cooked and the shrimp looked like they were from the freezer.  I wasn't impressed with the crab cake either.  My husband had the rib eye and he only had a little bit of this too because it was nothing special.  The steak had no taste to it.
I wish I had stayed home and cooked some steaks on the grill because first of all the quality of the meat would of been 100% better than what they were serving. 
There is absolutely nothing special about this chophouse.  There are a lot of great steakhouses in Tampa and this would just doesn't compare.   The place is so loud that you can't even carry on  a conversation.  I guess if you want to go to Ybor City to have dinner this is the only steak place there and I am going to say that this probably why it is crowded.

"A true treasure in the middle of the Tampa Palms, where good food is often tough to find. After a few different experiments with the space that included The Lime and The Lodge (as a stand alone). it looks like they've finally found a combination they like by taking the old Ciccio and Tony's and combining it with The Lodge concept from South Tampa. 

The menu is just massive, and filled with what they call ""California Cuisine."" This includes everything from nachos, sushi, pastas, pizzas, and rice bowls. If you can't find something on the menu, you are too picky an eater to ever dine out anyway.

The stirfrys are excellent, with chicken, steak, or shrimp added to vegetables plus yellow or brown rice. Served with both chopsticks and a fork and knife so you can dine however you'd like. Try the Southwest with jack cheese, and get it with spicy chicken if you want just a bit of heat. Also recommend the penne pasta with sausage; it's pretty simple, but for some reason better than a pasta with sauce you would get most places. 

The wraps are a North Tampa lunch staple, and come in every form from Cuban to buffalo chicken. What makes them dreamy are the added sauces, with a dozen that range from Maytag bleu cheese to basil pesto. The decision is the toughest part.

I was there for lunch today with my laptop to get some work done, and just got some nachos (1/2 price during happy hour) and a Diet Coke. For $6 I got a big plate of multi colored chips covered in steak, white queso, tomatoes, black olives, and other goodies. As usual at Ciccio's, it was excellent. 

Happy Hour is from 3-7, and includes $5 sushi rolls,, 1/2 price nachos, $.50 wings, 2-4-1, house wines, $2 drafts, and $4 margaritas as well as other specials. 

The only drawback is the decor and ambiance. There just isn't much to it. Besides a large, simple bar that dominates the space as soon as you walk in, the black walls are most unadorned except for a few TV's. It's better than it was when they used to pack in all this amazing food in what is now half the space of the current place (when the building was split in two), but there still isn't much happening there. It is more than plenty big enough now, and has ample space for large groups. It's tough being in a strip mall to create atmosphere, and I'm not sure what they could do to improve it, but it's the only thing that keeps this place from being a total win.",25,B,Ciccio's Lodge,Ciccio's Lodge,Ciccio's Lodg3,4.0,POSITIVE

"Brand spanking new and pretty fantastic!  This new neighborhood pizzeria has received some nice reviews for their other locations in Orlando and St Pete and we were excited to try it out.  In a great location on the NE corner of Dale Mabry and Fletcher right next to the Fresh Market, they were taunting me with their menu of the sweet San Marzano tomatoes and great lunch steals to boot.  Although you may feel like you are in a counter service fast food place that is quite contrary to what they are.  You do get full table service and outstanding service at that- not only was our waiter Alan on top of his game but other servers were equally as professional, polite and engaging.  It's not often that you have other servers stop by your table and compliment your choice of order or politely joke with you when you are taking some cell phone pics of the restaurant.  The menu is thorough and boasts of a variety of appetizers, salads (sadly no soups) and two-types-of crust pizza with options galore.  They also serve 16 beers on top (no bar here but no need) and a couple of wine selections reasonably priced.

Pizza ""chains"" even smaller ones like this can be hit or miss- and they hit the nail on the head!  We love that there are outdoor table options that will come in handy on gorgeous days and leisurely lunches.  Their neopolitan crust was crunchy and just the right thickness.  They loaded our pizza with fresh mozzerella and ricotta, sausage, salami and garlic...... we were able to easily change up a couple of items on their ""vesuvio"" pizza and it was really really delicious.  The sauce can make or break an Italian restaurant and they definitely got it right.  Sweet and just the right thickness mad it easy to dip your bread and crust into. 
 
It looks like their lunch specials are going to make this a crowded space once the word gets out.... $3.50 for a salad..... under $6 for drink plus a pizza, $6 calzones, etc.  The sizes for regular pizzas for dinner are reasonable and decently priced especially in comparison to competition not too far away.

The only (3 little drawbacks) we felt were not being sure when we walked in whether this was a counter service type of place or whether we were to seat ourselves, easily fixable with signage -but they were very quick to seat us regardless.  Would love it if they added a simple miestrone soup to their menu - it would go over well for a lunchtime combo or in addition to a dinner pizza.  They also need to rethink their to-go/take home packaging.  With 3 pieces left -it wasn't quite enough for their large pizza boxes to be wasted and instead the styrafoam box would've meant stacking each large pizza and knowing that the next day we'd have a 3 tiered stuck together single piece to content with.  Alan easily gave us pieces of  parchment paper to place in between solving the problem, but  maybe that should be the standard to bring out going forward or have some foil or smaller pizza boxes on hand.  Wonder what they send out with to-go orders for a small individual pizza?? Last but not least, the paper underneath the pizza between it and the pizza serving board was an issue.... it got greasy quickly and stuck to the bottom of the pizza.... there's gotta be a better way.  

Regardless of these tiny suggestions, this place is a real winner and I'm positive we will be coming here very often.  The manager came over and greeted us and again Alan was a real star of a server!  I can see coming here with a group and certainly seeing little league teams lined up for a celebration someday here.  They did a nice touch adding in the kitchen bar seating for a fast solo meal and a few flat screen tvs that didn't take away from the atmosphere and will certainly be appreciated during football game, etc.  They do deliver and are open until midnight at least every night which is another rarity that will be taken advantage of by many.  

Definitely get there soon, this place will become crowded if they keep up the extremely fresh and well thought out flavor!  Can't wait to get back and try the calzones.... stay tuned!",25,B,Flippers Pizzeria,Flippers Pizzeria,Flippers Pizzeria,5.0,NEGATIVE

"Oh my gods how much I love Pappas' food. Used to be a regular at the old Louis Pappas in Tarpon Springs many years ago... it was worth the drive.

Having this place now a mile off is just wonderful. 

My last visit - I goofed and over ordered. I got the large chopped salad. Yeah, only do that if you are feeding two. Or maybe 3. Its ginormous. This is actually the very first time I have ever had the chopped version (i was raised on the standard style) and, well - I'll probably only ever order this version in the future. Pappas invented the potato salad on the bottom style salad, and they still do it just perfect.

Also added gyro meat - which is not recommended. Only reason for the 4 stars over what should be 5. It came out burnt on some edges, was a bit dry, and I was perplexed why it was on the side... I expected the protiens to be added to the salad. Gyro meat is great with sauce and/or veggies - kinda not so much alone. 

So, next visit: Small salad for one, or large salad for two. Maybe add chicken - gyro meat reserved for gyro plate or an actual gyro.",5,A,Louis Pappas Fresh Greek,Louis Pappas Fresh Greek,louis pappas fresh greek,4.0,POSITIVE

"There's not a lot about Applebee's that's super special or unique, except the bartender Jessa. I almost always have an enjoyable experience, and It's kind of hard for the kitchen to mess up bar food. There are always some good specials going on. I enjoy that there's always a dollar drink of the month. I'm also a big fan of the all-you-can-eat specials. It's one of my favorite late-night spots for these reasons. If you're looking for a wholesome home-cooked meal this isn't the place. It's more of a bar than a restaurant. Don't come here expecting to be wowed by the food. Come here when you want a few drinks and a quick bite to eat at an affordable price. The service can be hit or miss unless you sit at the bar, but if you do you'll have no issues waiting on your next drink. Jessa is awesome which means your drink will always stay full. You will actually have to tell her ahead a time when you are on your last one, or another one will appear. The restaurant is definitely marketed differently than what it is, but that is understandable because you can't really market yourself as a bar that you can bring your kids to, but if the shoe fits.",40,C,Applebee's Grill + Bar,Applebee's Grill + Bar,Appl3b33's Grill + Bar,5.0,POSITIVE
"This location underwent an interior renovation in recent years, but I still wouldn't choose to dine in unless I was sharing a table with fully uniformed members of Tampa law enforcement or a couple of Lightning defenseman with freshly taped sticks.

However, I have successfully ordered takeout from this location previously and decided recently to give their new online ordering a try.

Praise goes to Denny's for having an online ordering system that is among the easiest I've used for any type of restaurant. The web designers at the corporate office made the website easy to use in terms of navigation and customizing menu items.

Because I live one block away, the offer of delivery rather than pickup intrigued me. However, they wanted $5.50 before tip to do so, which prompted me to jump in my car for the extremely short drive to get my order.

Both of my breakfast menu items were ready at the designated time, accurately made and the portion size offered the value that has kept Denny's in business for generations.

In particular, the Santa Fe skillet with the additional fajita blend option added made for a sizable plate of delicious food that would make any of you Sunday Brunch snobs very happy whether you're washing it down with bottomless mimosas or not. 

Bottomless mimosas holds zero appeal for me. Much like a Yelp event at an escape room and there's a lengthy power outage.

The only thing involving the word ""bottomless"" that I like is a great Rodney Dangerfield joke about how he couldn't get laid at bars:

""I saw this one bar. The sign said ""Topless, Bottomless."" I went inside, there was nobody there! I don't know what I'm doing so I tried a gay bar. Oooh, that was no good either. There were 15 guys for every guy!""",36,C,Denny's,Denny's,denny's,3.0,POSITIVE

"So I've followed the gluten free lifestyle for about 5 years. Since being diagnosed with celiac disease, it has been a struggle because I LOVE baked goods and I LOVE classic pasta. I pretty much LOVE processed wheat. lol 

Anyways... because I've been on this eating regimen for so long, I like to think I'm pretty knowledgeable in gluten-free foods, how to make them, which brands are the best, and which bakeries/restaurants are safe. 

I was pretty excited to go to Viitals upon first hearing about them on Yelp and seeing their menu on their website. I knew I was going to get the Caprese panini and a cupcake. It's not everywhere that you can get a gluten-free panini. Ok... let me rephrase what I just said, you can't get them anywhere. 

The Caprese panini was DELICIOUS!!! So delicious that I wanted to buy a loaf of Viitals homemade bread and make my own panini's everyday. I also got the Vanilla dreams cupcake. Because of my love for baked goods, it has been my life goal to bake gluten free items that taste amazing and do not leave you wanting more and comparing it to its wheat-filled counterpart. Though I have lots of love for Viitals, the cupcake was not good in comparison to other gluten free cupcakes I've eaten. However, since it was also vegan, when comparing it to the one vegan cupcake I had, this was far better. 

I will definitely be visiting Viitals on a regular basis. The panini and salad were fresh and delicious, the decor was cute and comfy, and the staff there was super friendly and knowledgeable.

"I usually don't give bad review. But this time i really have to because I have never had bad experiences with other locations. This is the first time me and my friends dined in at this location. First the waitress was really rude. she has an attitude from the beginning to the end. She forgot my baby's order and my fries for the side dish. We were waiting long enough that I'm half way finished my food so I called her up to reminded her she came ""okey I will check"" then about 5 mins later she came with the orders, put them down and say ""sorry guys they were waiting for fries and that was my fault"" (yes of cause what do you think lol) but i said ""that's ok it happens"" lol second I ordered bacon burger and I want my burger medium, I received well done which is fine I'm not picky. My baby who's 2 years old she wants the cheese burger, (this I couldn't stand) her burger came out medium.. the beef inside still bloody and cold! So I called the waitress to let her know and send the food back, she came with attitude with both hands on her hips and asked me ""what's wrong?"" So I replied ""I'm sorry but this burger is uncooked, u must misunderstood me I want my burger medium and my baby meal should be well done"" She goes ""oh sorry but they always cook like this the same way.. well let's see what I can do?"" 5 mins Later the manager came with new burgers for my baby however one burnt and another one cook just about right so I take that. Think hey we are human thing like this happened and My baby wouldn't finish both burgers. Third my friend ordered pasta, she specifically say she wants the broccoli cooked and soft... Ofcause broccolis came uncooked and very crunchy lol so she politely addressed that with the waitress.. didn't want anything just want to let her know because when she ordered it the waitress even said she wants her broccoli cooked also but again shit happens later the waitress brought boiled extra broccolis for my friend which we didn't asked for.. with atttitude ofcoz But it's good here. Forth the Caesar salad which is my another friend ordered as a side was totally nasty! How hard to cook Caesar salad? It looks like a dog puke! We all gave it a try but omg nasty, cold, lettuces looks old and saggy! So we left it alone! After all these melt down I guess the manager smell our silent angers, she came to apologized and offered free dessert.. but we didn't even want nothing from the kitchen no more! Later the waitress came for the check, she also offered us with her attitude ""if you want it's on the House"" kind of offer..  lol my 2 years old wants some dessert due she didn't finish her one edible little burger And I didn't even bother asking for box to take home! So we gave the last chance to make it right.. my baby ordered caramel crunch cake.. the cake looks old so we didn't even touch it only took ice cream part. Last part we split the bills I paid with credit card, my friend paid with cash.. the waitress didn't bring back her change. So my friend asked for the change back.. she gave us the look, and say ""oh you want a change back?"" (Err yes! Even tough we should pay 10% doesn't mean you have a right to keep our change without our permission) that's it! I was gonna leave 10% tips as a good manner for dining and cleaning! I didn't leave none! (Never in my life did that!) I honestly disappointed.. and she deserves not even 1 penny from me. Neither from my friends. How could you served uncooked meat to a toddler? Common sense! Btw I rather pay for McDonald's because seriously I have never had any problem with my kid meal! I can say i will never ever go back to this location ever again and I'm considering to stop going to Ruby Tuesday Because the price is equally TGIF or other chain restaurant. I can't believe this location still haven't closed from health department. The restaurant smell like mud, only positive I would say it was my raspberry tea.

Can't wait to come back, loved it!!",26,B,Aroi Thai Tsuyu,Aroi Thai Tsuyu,Aroi Thai Tsuyu Inc.,5.0,POSITIVE
"Well priced, luxurious feel, roomy, and most importantly a clean environment. As most Italian restaurants, fresh bread is served with butter, but not any regular butter a very tasty, rosemary twist that is definitely one of a kind, might not sound tasty but give it a try, its really delicious. Located in a nice, clean, and quiet area which some weekends has live music and local events that while you wait for your table, or after dinner you can stroll around and enjoy West Tampa. Being from the Tri-state area, this was definitely a great location to have a restaurant. Did I mention that they also serve dogs? YES YOU CAN BRING YOUR FURRY FRIEND TO ENJOY DINNER AS WELL!

"This is a cute little bakery with a small but delicious window case of pastries. They had a few savory options that sounded really good (like the pepper jelly goat cheese croissant) but we were in the mood for something sweet. We decided on the brioche donuts with peanut butter filling and the Nutella croissant.

The croissant they warmed up which was a great move but I think they could've left it in a little longer to get it to almost hot instead of just luke warm. Otherwise it was a pretty standard croissant, nice and flaky but nothing really special. 

The donut on the other hand was delicious! The brioche was thick, a little dense (in a good way) and soft and buttery. I like brioche donuts a lot because the dough itself isn't all that sweet, it just adds a perfect neutral base for the other sweet elements. The filling though was the real star of this! So light and airy with a little saltiness from the peanut butter. Very well done! My only regret is that I couldn't get a cruffin cause they only sell them on Friday and Saturday. Oh well, next time I'm in Tampa!",31,C,The Vine Baking,The Vine Baking,Th3 Vin3 Baking,4.0,POSITIVE
"This review is based strictly on service.
After having a shit morning myself, I have to say this experience was the tip of the iceberg for me.

I walked in to be ""greeted"" by someone that seemed to be IMMEDIATELY irritated by the fact that I was there.
I say ""greeted"" because she simply just starred at me waiting for an order without any verbal greeting at all.
Probably the second costumer of the day and things were already sour.
As she continued to stare at me I said ""hi, how are you today?"" And she continued to ignore me then asked what I wanted.

She gave extremely small portions of everything I ordered, and I nicely asked if it was possible to have a little more so she yelled to the cashier to charge me double.

Almost to completion of my burrito, the only words I got from her were ""Anything else?""

The cashier was sweet, patient with the exact cash protocol (which also wasn't brought to my attention until checkout).
Even opened my coke for me (the cashier being so kind was the only reason I didn't leave me food there and leave)

Then while cashing out, middle of a conversation with the cashier, the lady RUDELY yelled ""do you want a bag?"".
At first I wasn't certain she was speaking to me, considering I was discussing change options at the register.
But she made sure to repeat it again even louder than the first time.

Not to mention she verbally announced how ""irritated"" she was in the middle of making the customer behind me's order.

So I'll leave her with some advice.
As someone in The service industry myself, customer service and attitude are EXTREMELY important.
You're human, you're allowed to be upset and irritated and pissed off.. but when a PAYING CUSTOMER is in your presence, that changes IMMEDIATELY.

And if hiding those emotions isn't something that you're capable of, then this industry isn't for you.",19,B,Chipotle Mexican Grill,Chipotle Mexican Grill,Chipotl3 M3xican Grill,2.0,NEGATIVE

"A huge shout out to this Boston Market location!  Super friendly and clean store.  Boston market is a generally good chain with American comfort food menus. Everyone loves Boston Market food! 

The reason I am writing this review is to bring attention to their catering and large take out options.  I came in to order food for family after a funeral.  I was taking food for 10 to eat and I wanted plenty left over for next day meals and snacks so I was in that in-between area between full catering and regular take out.  They were so helpful in guiding me to options that would provide variety and be plentiful.  Really, really helpful - Even advising me on which items would provide more food quantity for the money.  When I arrived to pick up the food later in the day, they had really gone the extra mile packing it so it was easy for me to deliver and still presented very nicely. They even had a nice gentleman help me carry the food to the car!   I will remember them as a go to affordable place for this type of special case or in between catering - I mean really, I don't host a ton of 50+ events, but I take a lot of food to people in the 10-20 meal range - what a find!!!

"Another discovery thanks to Yelp! this place is a splendid hidden gem in a business dominated district in Tampa. My co-workers and I were having a training seminar nearby at our State office and decided to break for lunch. The office is kinda in the boonies in the middle of nowhere in an area dominated by businesses. Being that I'm not from Tampa, I don't know the ins and outs of the city so I turned to Yelp and I haven't been let down yet. I noticed JC's is one of the only spots in this area and had some promising reviews so I said lets give it a whirl. 

I took my colleagues with me and man I was surprised by this little hole in a wall that packs a punch. This spot doesn't have normal business hours, so don't expect to swing by for a munchies binge late night, their market is mainly breakfast and lunch and close really early and that makes perfect sense since their in the middle of warehouses and blue collar type of jobs. 

The owners appear to be of cuban decent and abuelo evens busses tables and all, sweet old man, he seems to be a favorite and I see him chatting it up with the customers. They have plenty of hot and old sandwiches along with traditional hispanic and american lunch and breakfast plates. I had the Cuban, and it was exceptional, being Cuban American myself I'm a tough judge and they did a great job. 

 It's a cozy down to earth place with exceptional service and amazing flavorful food that will be perfect for a quick breakfast or lunch that will not only fill your stomach but put a smile to your face.",16,B,J C's Sandwich Shop,J C's Sandwich Shop,J C's Sandwich Shop Inc.,4.0,POSITIVE
Nice location but the food is bland. The chips were subpar and the salsa almost completely devoid of flavor.

"First, you need to understand that to us, there is nothing better than great room service.  1823 came out of the gate strong, and we were excited. 

Here is what happened:

Thursday 27 June - Room Service
- Turkey Burger - When the burger arrived:
         o It was 3.5+ inches in diameter
         o About 1 1/8 thick
         o Juicy and moist
         o Great bun, but we don't do much bread.  Was still so good though

Friday 28 June - At in the bar (you attempted to help on this one)
- Fish Tacos - When the tacos arrived:
         o A little over blackened and dry, but good
- Grouper Sandwich - We had to order two... 
         o First sandwich - Very dry and Very salty.  We sent back
         o Second sandwich - Still very dry, did not eat. 
- Fries - We ordered with both the tacos and sandwich.  
         o We asked for extra crisp and no salt.
         o The fries both came out and were both salted (I know the bartender requested no salt)
         o We got another order of fries that were good. 

Saturday 29 June 
- Fish Tacos - When the tacos arrived:
         o Tacos were excellent, and not nearly as cooked as much as before (were 
         quite good, but nowhere near the same as what I ordered on Friday) 
- Turkey Burger - When the burger arrived:
         o It was (at most) 1.5 inches in diameter (much smaller)
         o About ¾ inch thick (much thinner)
o Overcooked, hard, burnt, and inedible (sent back again)
- Fries - We ordered with both the tacos and burger.  
o We asked for extra crisp and no salt.
o Both fries both came out and were both salted (I know that we requested no salt)
o We got another order of fries that were good. 

What 1823 does that is great, is your breakfast!!  
- The first few days we had scrambled eggs and toast in the restaurant.  They were excellent 
         o Lincoln is your best asset in the restaurant
         o There is another lady who is worthless (older, very short light brown hair, etc.)
         - She could not figure out what we ordered
         - The eggs came, and I requested salsa
         - She brought ""Selzer water"".  
         - I did notice that she paid almost all of attention to the couples that were older (ignoring everyone else)
- The last day I had the BEST omelet from room service.  Very well done, great cheese, and avocado.  

Other honorable mentions:
- Tayler - delivered room service the first night
- Barry and AJ - bartenders
- Steve Heald -  Assistant Manager",37,C,1823 Kitchen & Bar,1823 Kitchen & Bar,1823 Kitchen & Bar,2.0,POSITIVE

"This review is for their drive thru.

The Brisket Shoppe serves up brisket and sausage for about half the week (they are closed for the first half of the week). They have outdoor seating, but I went through the drive thru. They also have curbside service if you call ahead.

I tried a hot link, a jalapeno cheddar sausage and the coleslaw. They no longer have collard greens, although it shows up on their online menu (as of today).

The food was nicely packed up. The sausages were both pretty good with a good snap to the casing. The coleslaw was unexpectedly good. It was largish chunks of cabbage and onion in a spicy, herbalicious vinaigrette. I would have preferred the veggies to be cut into smaller pieces, but the flavor was so good that my qualms were dismissed. 

This isn't fast food, so don't expect fast food prices or speeds, but the quality is good, and this place was worth the trip. I can't wait to return to try their brisket and ribs.",16,B,The Brisket Shoppe,The Brisket Shoppe,The Brisket Shoppe,5.0,POSITIVE

I had the tandoori chicken and paneer bowl. It was a generous serving and came with either rice or quinoa, some cooked onions and bell pepper, and a tomato cucumber salad. You also have the choice between a green goddess-based sauce or lemon tahini sauce. My food was excellent! I've never had tandoori paneer before, and I think I liked it better than the chicken! It's like a heartier tofu, a great conduit of flavor without being meat. Nothing was oily, and portion size was good for a large meal.

The ham, turkey, roast beef and tuna are my go to sandwiches on a whole wheat rool, with the bread hollowed out. I pile on the veggies and feel, I an getting a fairly nutritious meal at a good price.
There are tables to set at, but I usually stop when I am on the run. It is a quick in & out, depending on your time of arrival. I also feel it is a good value for what you are receiving. It's not Boar's Head,  but the portions are always the same.

"Thank goodness for the view, because the  service and food quality was below average. We had an appetizer hit the table after they brought our main course, and the (13) wing app came with only 2 celery sticks. It was a very sad presentation. We watched the table to our left get seated and wait 5 minutes for a greeting, and after another 5 min and still no water on the table they got up and walked out. Our Shock Top draft beers were just a notch above room temp. I was really surprised not to see anyone walking the restaurant who appeared to be a manager and asking how the food or service was. This was a beautiful Saturday afternoon and Channelside was busy, but Bennigens was not. My fish and chips had more fried breading then fish, and it was as if it had a crispy outside layer then a soggy mushy inner layer.

"Le Mouton gives me hope for what Channelside can become. As the other reviews have mentioned, the owner did a great job of creating an inviting space. The decor is much like his baked goods- simple, unassuming and well done. 

I should start be mentioning that I don't eat sweets so I can't speak to those. I know that my roommate has had some sort of croissant that she said reminded her of the ones she had in Paris and a cannoli that she still talks about. What I CAN speak to is that they are look beautiful! The cases could be painted, framed, and hung on the wall of a different French bakery.

The bread is fantastic. The baguette is crispy on the outside fluffy on the inside. It's really good. I got the wheat bread this week and they sliced it for me. I paid maybe .25 more than I would have at the grocery and it was obviously superior! My only tip would be to put it in a gallon bag so it keeps longer. 

What truly stands out about Le Mouton is the quality of the food. There aren't corners being cut. They don't call themselves an artisan bakery for marketing purposes. They truly go beyond putting out bake goods and put out something close to art. I also love any place that tries to use local sources whenever available.

I'm so disappointed it's hard to even write this. Channelside wanted ""more of a bar""? Well, they have it. It's a fucking bar. Just like every other fucking American bar I've been to. They might as well have put an Applebee's in there.

Got the OMG grilled cheese which had asparagus, goat cheese, oyster mushroom and welsh cheddar. Felt like there were pockets of goat cheese and cheddar that overwhelmed the asparagus and oyster mushroom. 

Also got the cheeseboard. Pretty good. They had slices of star fruit and I was so excited to see that. Olive tapenade and the pickles were good too.

"Delicious and reasonably priced Cuban sandwich! It's just $3.50. They use real Cuban bread (crispy outside, chewy soft inside), pulled pork, ham, American cheese, tomato, mustard, etc. Why does this place have only one other review? I guess you have to live or work in the area to know about it. But it's the best Cuban sandwich I've tried so far in Tampa! No joke some places only use slice ham, but it's the mix of pulled pork and other meats which makes it really tasty. Note: this place closes early although their sign may say otherwise, so the best time to come is at lunch. I want to try other dishes but the sandwich is just too hard to pass up! 4 stars for just the Cuban sandwich, reserving my last star for when I try other dishes, which may never happen unless they run of out Cuban bread!",4,A,Bobby Sandwich Shop,Bobby Sandwich Shop,Bobby Sandwich Shop,4.0,POSITIVE

We also discovered a smoking area that we didn't know existed. Anyway we were assured by the server that we should have no problem getting served and out of there in less than 30 minutes. She was true to her word! But just to be sure we ordered light, pretzels and chicken wings. I sampled the pretzel and sorry to say I wasn't impressed. They were obviously nuked and so they were rubbery. But my wife and daughter in law had the buffalo wings and they said that they were delicious. I had the porter beer which was wonderful.

"The experience I had was somewhat disastrous/unfortunate.  From the outside, the restaurant looked a little run down, but that didn't really faze me, since obviously it is the food that matters, not the looks.  {Looks + ambiance are mostly bonuses for me, not requirements.}  Anyways, the restaurant was very empty when we arrived, but somehow we were seated relatively slowly.  The waitress was somewhat snarky when I just ordered a water and mentioned I had a Groupon*.

First they gave us some bread, which was pretty good (standard rolls).  I was a little surprised that the butter was given to us in disposable plastic cups (seemed to cheapen the atmosphere--I mean it's not like we were taking it to-go).

I ordered the crab alfredo, which tasted fine, except it was over salted and the oil was separating out in a way that looked pretty gross.  It was also served on a plate, so it's presentation was terrible (liquidy sauce + pasta sprawled all over the plate...would have looked better in a wide bowl with a ledge or something).  

My companion ordered some sort of steak, which ended up being very very fatty, instead of nicely marbled, and somewhat soggy.

We then ordered dessert, but they were out of almost everything that sounded good to us (and the waitress mentioned that they ordered their desserts from a company, so it's not like they even make their own).  Dessert was unremarkable (can't remember what I got).

Payment was kind of a pain.  The waitress scanned my Groupon and gave me the receipt to sign, but charged me the full price.  So I had to remind her I had a Groupon to get  the corrected price.  Then, turns out the price of the steak was higher on the menu than on the receipt, so it turns out that we could've gotten more food with the Groupon than we had calculated (there were only 2 of us, so it was hard to use up all $50, so even though we were full, and didn't need to get more, I was thinking of grabbing a dessert for my roommate, to-go), but she said that they already closed our tab, so we couldn't use the $7 remaining, and we also couldn't use the $7 to add to the gratuity (we were thinking we could tip and add the $7 and just give a really high tip, but it didn't count at all). :(

*I understand that restaurants aren't the most excited about customers using Groupons, but I kind of see it as a safe way to try new places--if it's good I will return, if not, then I didn't risk as much money...plus, I always tip off the original price, and I usually try to tip higher when getting a discount, so there's really no reason to be that prejudiced to Grouponers + you still have to work for your tip, so shouldn't be rude from the get go...& I know drinks are a major source of revenue, but water is just healthier, so it's always aggravating when people get snarky when just water is ordered.",6,A,Landers Steakhouse,Landers Steakhouse,Landers Steakhouse Inc.,2.0,NEGATIVE

This food was yummy yummy yummy to our tummy. I also think to myself if I could make the food I order. I don't think I could make this and am happy to have tried something different.

"Wow, this is one of those times that I wish I had paid attention to the Yelp reviews before stepping foot into this AYCE American Chinese buffet.  China Pearl SUPER Buffet is located along N. Dale Mabry Highway right before the bridge carrying you over the railroad tracks and Busch Boulevard, and then before the traffic light at Linebaugh Avenue.

From the outside the restaurant is modeled to look like a cheery Asian temple with lots of blues, reds, and golds, and there is a large parking lot to handle the swarms of walking dead Wal-Creatures who decide to stop here. 

My first clue that this was destined to be a forgettable meal was the fact there were only 5 tables of people inside of the restaurant, and that none of these people were Asian. After surveying the crowd I realized that there were some important differentiators between me and the rest of these people:

#1  I have a pulse. 

#2  I was not wearing pajama bottoms and flip flops.

#3  I was not shoveling the food into my mouth without chewing.

There are three food stations set up to one side of the restaurant. The first, closest to the wall, had wilted salad fixings, fruit, pudding, Jell-O, and sheet cakes. At the far end of this table was the sushi -- primarily California rolls, and pieces of nigiri that had been sitting out so long that the fish had actually turned a gray color. YUM!!!!

The second and third stations were set up as steam tables. This was the usual collection of soup pots, fried rice, Asian noodles, crab Rangoon, greasy egg rolls, fried chicken fingers, and deep-fried mystery meals.

One small problem -- there were no heated water baths under the buffet pans to keep the food steaming warm. Instead, everything sat under heat lamps until it was devoid of any moisture.....or flavor. Everything looked as though it had been fried in oil. The food tasted greasy, and salty, and was just a notch above room temperature.

I will say that the servers were very pleasant, and quick to refill my Diet Coke, and for that this restaurant has earned one star. Next time I'll avoid going here and therefore no longer need the the post-meal bottle of Kaopectate.

"My husband and I went here for 'date night' on Sunday.  They had only been fully open a few days.  The restaurant was very clean and the staff were incredibly nice to us throughout the night. 

We started with drinks and an appetizer - the candied bacon.  I've had it before when the bacon is VERY heavy and sweet - this was perfectly  balanced.  With a poached egg in the middle and crusty bread, it was amazing!  We also loved the bread they serve - perfect in every way - sitting in olive oil and herbs, and we could tell the bread was made on-site.  

For dinner, I ordered Filet and my husband the bone in ribeye.  They were both fabulous. Best steaks I've ever had.  You can certainly tell they don't bulk buy their steaks... these were prime cuts of meat!  We were torn with the decision to order a side of mashed potatoes or scalloped potatoes, and the server highly recommended the scalloped, so we did.  And she was right - they were fabulous!  At first I thought the portion was big enough to share, but I'm glad we each ordered our own because, after tasting it, I didn't want to share.  

This place is awesome! Keep in mind, it's not cheap -  but in my opinion, it's worth every penny.

"I stopped in here for a quick lunch while I was serving jury duty at the nearby District Courthouse. I was sat very promptly, and my order was taken quickly.

If you order an entrée, even at lunch, it comes with a cup of soup and spring roll. Those dishes also came out quickly. The spring roll was small but decent, while the soup was just salty chicken broth with a scoop of rice thrown in.

My meal took quite some time to come out. I ordered the tofu and vegetable stir fry, and it was quite a disappointment. There were about five pieces of tofu, and the vegetables were overwhelmingly sliced carrots.  Had the sauce been good, that still would have been okay, but the sauce was almost flavorless, and embarrassingly watery. Plus, after such a long wait, the dish was not served hot.

What's worse, i got my receipt before my food. As far as the food goes, it's ok. I had to actually ask other staff so i can pay my bill. When the original server came, she rudely asked how much should i give her tip. I said 10%. She rolled her eyes then stated that the standard is 20% and left. In my defense as i walked away, i told another server that i would have given at least 20% as my standard.

"I received a coupon book about Papa Murphy's Pizza. The coupon book had very few locations and one closer to us is at 5371 Ehrlich Road in Tampa FL. Saturday evening, my wife was hungry for a pizza so I decided to go to Papa Murphy's Pizza located at 5371 Ehrlich Road to order a large Cheese Pizza to go. After paying them $9.00 and when they call my name, I received an uncooked pizza with an instruction to bake it home at 425 F. I had no idea that I  would be coming home with a raw pizza when my wife is hungry. First of all, they should have told me in advance what I would be receiving and had I known it earlier, I would have never paid them in advance and would have either gone to Pizza Hut or Papa John's. 

After waiting for a gas oven to pre-heat to 425 F that took another 12 minutes and then wait another 15 to 18 minutes to bake and the result came out as a frozen chewy pizza that I just purchased from Wal-Mart's Frozen Food section and paid Publix price,

My opinion is that it is not a good place to go if you are hungry and need a quick meal. Should have gone to Papa's John or Pizza Hut which are much closer to my home and their large Pizza with one or two toppings cost only $10.00  and read to eat.",6,A,Papa Murphy's Take 'N' Bake Pizza,Papa Murphy's Take 'N' Bake Pizza,Papa Murphy's Tak3 'N' Bak3 Pizza,2.0,NEGATIVE
"truly disgusting!! We live locally and are new to the area and decided to try it, despite the outdated questionable appearance.  We should have followed our instincts and stayed away.  
My husband and I both previously lived in NYC and do have high expectations when it comes to food especially Italian food but this place wasn't mediocre, it was repulsive!!  
I ordered the Chicken parm which did not look right.  It appeared they had used prepared(bagged)chicken fingers for their chicken- no nice juicy chicken cutlets hand breaded and pan fried, these things came out of the freezer aisle at restaurant depot. A serious disappointment!   Secondly, their sauce looked almost brown, which is never a good sign.  I think it must have been cooking for years to look this bad.  It tasted as bad as it looked.  There was nothing fresh about it. It had a very uniform texture almost like ketchup and tasted bitter and way too garlicky.  Ragu would have been a huge improvement!! At this point in the meal,  I looked at my husbands lasagna which had the same brown colored sauce and looked equally unappetizing and asked him how it was.  He shrugged and said not good.  He said it tasted freezer burned and also complained about the sauce.  I said, enough, we're not eating this crap.  We complained about the food and promptly left, never, ever to return again.  
Not sure how this place stays in business because it is always empty and only ever has happy hour people drinking outside but whatever the case may be- don't eat there!!",6,A,Rick's Italian Cafe,Rick's Italian Cafe,Rick's Italian Caf3,1.0,NEGATIVE

We decided to Captain Just was just the place and we were not disappointed.  The food was affordable for a regular customer, a couple on vacation or someone looking to impress on a date.  

I would recommend this restaurant to any of my friends or family.  The food is good, and the price allows you to try new foods and menu items without breaking the bank.

"Sub World Restaurant has been serving delicious breakfasts and lunches to the Carrollwood community for 25 years. This family-run restaurant is located in the Publix shopping center at the corner of Linebaugh Avenue and Dale Mabry. Sub World faces Dale Mabry, and you'll find it around the corner next to the dry cleaners and pizza place.

As you walk in the door the main counter is to your right with a number of padded bar stools, and then to your left are tables which can be pushed together for groups. The restaurant is small -- I would call it intimate -- but they are always filled with locals who are on a first-name basis with the staff.

This place is open Mon - Fri, 7am - 3pm, and Sat, Sun, 8am - 2pm, and they are all about serving you a delicious and filling breakfast or lunch for an extremely wallet-friendly price. Plenty of three-egg omelets, fried eggs, and breakfast sandwiches to get your day started. Lunch is all about submarine sandwiches with classic Italian cold cuts or a Cuban sub, and everything in between. They also offer salads, burgers, hot dogs and much more. Everything is prepared fresh and in-house.",14,B,Sub World Restaurant,Sub World Restaurant,Sub World Restaurant Inc.,4.0,POSITIVE
"First review for this working class East Tampa staple?! 

Anyway this place is just west of 50th St where 7th Ave turns into Broadway Ave. They are ONLY open until 2pm so they just serve breakfast and lunch. Get there before then if you have any interest in trying the food.

Prices are very reasonable, I had lunch with a lady friend for $12 that included 2 breakfasts and coffee. Even cooler was we came in at 8:10 and the food was on our table at 8:14! CRAZY fast. I think it might be slower around lunch peak time so prepare yourself if you are in a rush.

Menu items include 5 egg omelets for $5 and a monster burger that weighs in at 1.5lbs (and is the size of a take out box on a custom bun) for $8.99 (or 9.50 with cheese). There are daily specials on their big dry ease board (there were multiple meals for 5.99/6.99) and you will encounter many working folks there including deputies so you know it has to be decent.

Some folks might be turned off by the small size and look of the place. It only has about 8 bench/booth type tables and is looking a little old compared to ritzier establishments. 

Bottom line if you like a hearty american style breakfast / lunch this place is a great deal.",23,B,Frank's Sandwich Shop,Frank's Sandwich Shop,frank's sandwich shop,4.0,NEGATIVE
"Before writing my review on this place I just want to start by saying I'm basing this on friendliness, service, quality, taste & atmosphere. Today my sister and I finally stopped in! We have been wanting to venture in here for a while. When we arrived they were a bit busy.. which is understandable for a Sunday morning! Who doesn't want coffee and comfort foods. We waited about 10 mins in line to order. Even after waiting it took about 2 minutes for the man to approach us. He was friendly and asked what we were interested in trying. I ordered the iced coffee with almond milk cereal ( disappointed) cause I don't like almond milk and that was the only way you could get it was with almond milk. I also ordered a cup of cereal for my baby and a BLT on a bagel with cream cheese. When I got my coffee I was disappointed.. I thought it had actual cereal in it but it was just the milk that tasted like cereal. While waiting I noticed that these girls around us had coffees that looked completely different, creamier and had actual cereal on it. So I went and ordered a completed different coffee because I wasn't in love with mine. When I got my bagel it was pretty pathetic. There was barely any bacon... and the lettuce was falling out. They also forgot the cream cheese :( my sister ordered after me and they completely forgot her coffee after like 25 mins of us waiting for it .. they were apologetic about it though. I think the idea of the place is cool, i just think they need to improve the service to keep up with the pace of the orders and maybe work on the breakfast sandwiches. Not 100% sure if I'd come back based on the coffee because I didn't love it.",16,B,Milkin It,Milkin It,Milkin It,3.0,NEGATIVE

I went to Open Cafe because is was apparently so good that the pastor at a service raved about it for a good 6 min... no lie. I had to make a detour and I'm so glad I did.

Entering into the place lets be honest, it's like somebody's church hall. plastic on the tables and open seating of round tables. However, the service although slow is super friendly. 

Now, lets get to the BEST part... the FOooood! Foood so good it will make you hum and dance in your seat.

"Heard about this place from my in-laws. So we came in to give it a try. Close to home and we love some good Korean food. This place is located where the old Shells was, in the 4Rivers shopping plaza. Plenty of parking and easy to get in and out of the plaza. They have Korean fried chicken, grill available where you pick the meats and cook at your table or other Korean dishes including soups. 

We were greeted right when we walked in and immediately seated. Sat for a good 10 minutes before anyone came over to see if we were ready to order. They were extremely short staffed today! They had two staff members waiting tables and people were just coming and coming. I felt bad because our waitress was so busy going all over the restaurant waiting on folks. 

We ordered the beef bulgogi, fried tofu, fried chicken with the sweet and spicy sauce and beef brisket soup. I wanted the soy bean soup but they were out of it. The food took a long time to come out. After ordering we sat for probably another 40 minutes before part of our food came out. My daughters fried chicken took the longest! We were half way done before hers came out. Again, I can't hold the slowness against them since this is our first time here and they were extremely under staffed. Despite being busy they were so friendly. The food was good! Especially the fried chicken. I think that was the clear winner of the night. The chicken is fall off the bone tender and it's juicy and full of flavor!! The beef bulgogi was a smaller portion than we are used getting at other Korean places. It wasn't really flavorful, not bad but needed perhaps a bit more flavoring. We will definitely be back!

"Boy, this place sure picked a good name. Their signature dish is freshly fried tater tots covered with a variety of delicious things, mostly involving meat in some way. I tried the Italian Mess, with tomato sauce, mozzarella, and basil, and it was so delicious that I'm glad I didn't have to share.

And yet I'm pissed that I didn't have to share, because my Mess also included pesto. That hadn't been on the menu board, and I had to notice it and then ask whether there were pine nuts (yes). Had my wife taken the first bite, the day might have ended differently. Y'all, I don't ask much. But if your product has a common allergen (nuts) and you list every goddamn ingredient EXCEPT the allergen, you're cruising for a courtroom bruising.

Still... it's delicious. See you at the next rally!

(Edited to add: I checked whether or not pesto was on the menu board before waiting in line again to ask about it. I didn't want to waste my time. On this occasion, it turns out that pesto WAS NOT listed on the menu board.

"Was in Tampa on a business trip and decided to have dinner here.  The staff is friendly and I have to say quite good looking!    I was there on a Tuesday night when they were having a two for one special.  Couples can come in and order two entrees but only pay for the higher priced one... the lower priced one is free.  It was nice but since I was alone, it did not really help me.  My server told me that he would give me a coupon for another free entree to use another night!  I did not take it since I was not sure i would be back before my trip was over.

I wanted to order the filet mignon but was told they have been out of it for a few days.  A few days?  They promote themselves as an upscale place to eat... why would you not have filet mignon in stock at all times?  I ended up having blacked Tilapia with rice and vegetables.   The food came out fast but I have to say the fish was a bit dry.  The rice and vegetables were fine but I felt the fish had been pre cooked and kept warm.  This was the main reason I did not give more stars to the place.  I ended the meal with creme brulee and coffee.  That was fine.  I had also had two vodka tonics with the meal.  Both were served in a tall glass with no lime... kind of weird to me. 

In all it is a okay place to go.  It is clean and the staff tries hard to make things right.  After dinner I went to the bar side of the place and had one more drink.  I ordered vodka on the rocks and again, I watched the barman pour the drink into a tiny glass... just the opposite of what I got at dinner!  I have never seen it done this way but it was a full drink and it was fine.  As I sat there I saw the barman working and I soon saw that this guy was very new.  He kept referring to the menu and a bar book on how to make drinks... hence the weird glasses for my drinks... 

Anyway hopefully you will have a better meal than I did.  I do plan to visit again and will try again to see if it was just a bad meal or me.",30,C,Streetcar Charlie's Bar & Grille,Streetcar Charlie's Bar & Grille,Streetcar Charlie's Bar & Grille,3.0,NEGATIVE

"Ybor, not just a city but a man! I learned so much on this food tour. Raymond our tour guide had so much knowledge on Cigar City. The Cuban sandwich really represents the molding of all the cultures in to one great community (the salami for the Italians, the pork for the Cubans and the ham for the Spanish). With great enthusiasm Raymond walked us around Ybor pointing out the original cigar factory that Ybor built. We also learned about the ""casitas""; homes that Ybor provided for his 1,000 cigar works at cost! Ybor truly turned a alligator run swamp in to a bustling hot spot in the 1920s! Unfortunately, the great depression and machines crushed the city for 30 yrs! 

Tampa has really made a comeback with Ybor. New breweries, clubs and restaurants are moving in to the area. Truly a mixing of the new with the old. The tour is a lot of fun and I definitely feel I have a true understanding of the area. If you do decide to go on this tour, you must go on an empty stomach. All the food is super delicious but extremely filling. Keep in mind this may only interest people from out of town or those not familiar with the area.

"We come here once or twice a quarter and usually have good food and service. The last two times, especially tonight, the service has been so slow and unresponsive that I felt it time to write a review.
First, we had a small party of 4 and came in on Thursday just before 7 for dinner. While we were immediately seated (plenty of open tables) we  waited 23 minutes for any server to come to the table and acknowledge us. At 22 minutes, I finally went up to the bar to ask if we could order food and drinks directly from the bar tender, who didn't take our order but did locate and send a server to the table. We ordered simple items and two of the four meals were wrong (fettuccine Alfredo with spinach came out without any spinach and it took 10 minutes to get a side of spinach which had to be manually mixed into the meal. The other incorrect order was a chicken quesadilla which never came out at all (our food was delivered by someone other than our server so it took quite some time to get our server back to the table to ask where the missing quesadilla was). The server said she was waiting on the ""cheese quesadilla"" to come out but the kitchen was behind so they just sent out dinner for 3 of the 4 of us instead. We had to remind her that it was a chicken quesadilla that had been ordered and she said she wrote down CHX and thought that meant cheese so she had put in a cheese quesadilla (even worse that a cheese quesadilla was not ready in time to come out with the 3 other meals). 
Drink refills were non-existent and the check had to be requested from both our server and a second server who walked by over 10 minutes later. 
If you do go and you are able to get service, your food is likely to be adequate, as it is consistently average food. The service may cause you to need blood pressure medicine and three hours time though so you probably should go elsewhere until they get they ship straightened out.",34,C,Ballyhoo Grill,Ballyhoo Grill,B@llyhoo Grill,3.0,NEGATIVE

"Sunny Pizza recently opened next door to the International Boba House. The location has seen some turnover, but here is hoping that this pizza place will stick! The owner is really friendly and creative. 

My first time there I ordered the San Francisco Sourdough pizza which has that slight sour taste that a bread bowl would have with cheese and tomato sauce loaded on top. Speaking of tomato sauce, the tomato sauce is made fresh in-house and you can taste the real tomatoes in the sauce.

They have Jarritos Mexican soda which is basically my fave soda. Supposedly they also have a drink they make with a mix of Jarritos and Coconut milk. Like I said the owner is really creative, reminds me of the Cupcake Cache on Busch Boulevard or Revolution Ice Cream in Brandon.

Today I tried the Chicago Pizza with chicken, sausage, onions, mushrooms, and olives. It was quite tasty and the crust was toasted perfectly. The fresh tomato sauce was poured on-top of the pie. It was as filling as I'm accustomed to for a Chicago pizza, but did not leave me feeling like I overindulged afterwards, which almost never happens when I eat Chicago Pizza. I will credit the ingredients for that!

So I guess this review is just on the pho. I can't speak for anything else that comes from here.  They also have duck and char siu pork there, so those might be worth a try.  All I know is I will not be ordering the pho if i EVER come back...",12,A,Jubao Palace Noodle Bar - Seminole Hard Rock Tampa,Jubao Palace Noodle Bar - Seminole Hard Rock Tampa,Jubao Palac3 Noodl3 Bar - S3minol3 Hard Rock Tampa,2.0,NEGATIVE
Was working in Tampa and decided to order pizza to the hotel room. Ordered just a large pepperoni pizza and about 40 mins later a delicious large piping hot pizza arrived.

"We've eaten here twice, and my conclusion is that Rosati's has very good food but is totally unsuited as a place to sit down and eat. It puzzles me that they've got tables and chairs and napkin dispensers, but never any plates (paper or otherwise). They don't have a soda fountain, so they don't have any ice for your drink (or cups large enough for ice and a can of soda).  The staff are almost entirely focused on the back of the house, so it's essentially self-service.

Again, their food is good, and I'd recommend it for takeout -- but they may as well remove the tables and put in a long padded bench for people who are waiting for takeout orders.",36,C,Chicago Street Pizza,Chicago Street Pizza,Chicag0 Street Pizza,3.0,POSITIVE

From the loud cursing of the employees to one another, to their annoyed looks and attitudes while helping customers, and to top it off they shut down half the menu (at dinner time) because they were 'cleaning'.

"Seasons 52 invited me in for a tasting of their Alaska Copper River Salmon which is available for 7 weeks beginning on May 29th. We started our meal off with their Sonoma Goat Cheese Ravioli which was delicious and light. The wine we matched was King Estate Pinot Gris, 2010, Oregon which was light and sweet - a nice way to start our meal. 

Our waiter during the tasting, Jorge, went above and beyond what most waiters will do at food tastings. He knew the background behind the wines in a way that made me suspect he is probably a foodie. Seasons 52 has an upscale crowd and the waiter was very personable and social, not at all uptight or reflective of what some people would expect. 

After our appetizer we also tried the Ripe Plum Tomato Flatbread and Hass Avocado Salad. Both were great and I could see myself coming in for a drink and a flatbread even when I am not hungry for dinner. I found it interesting that everything is 475 calories or less on the menu - I dine with my family pretty regularly at The Cheesecake Factory and it is worrisome sometimes when we think about how some of those dishes have over 2,000 calories in them.

What I liked is Seasons 52 does not trade calories for taste. All the entrees I tried were still enjoyable. We put Mer Soleil 2009 Chardonnay and Kim Crawford 2011 Pinot Noir against each other to decide whether white or red wine would go better with our Alaska Copper River Salmon. My choice was the Mer Soleil Chardonnay, which was light, while still having enough body to complete the taste of the salmon.

The Alaska Copper River Salmon by the way was excellent. Tender and flavorful, the  summer corn risotto was an excellent addition to the dish and completed it. The vegetables (including the lemon to squeeze on the salmon) were roasted and put a nice finish to the entree. We snapped some photos of the raw salmon in the kitchen and the fish was very colorful in the raw. 

For dessert we had some shooters. I have tried shooters at Olive Garden in the past and been disappointed, but really enjoyed the Mocha Macchiato shooter I ate at Seasons 52. 

If it were just based on the food, I would probably wait one more time before giving Seasons 52 five-stars to check for consistency, but Jorge was really such a great waiter that I feel like it would be wrong to not give him his credit. If you go to Seasons 52, I recommend him as your waiter.

"This is the type of Cuban sandwich that you can't stop eating. If you think that you are going to eat half now, and the other half later, well, I got bad news for you: it's not going to happen. If you want something for later, buy another sandwich. You won't regret it, these Cubano sandwiches are so good. The combination of amazing bread, well portioned ham and pork, good and plentiful Swiss cheese, and the right heating point make this sandwich an amazing dish. There are not many places in Florida that make amazing Cuban sandwiches, and this is definitively one of them. Tops for me at least.

On my first visit here, I only wanted to try the Cubano sandwich. I have tried them at other restaurants in Tampa, and Tampa had nothing on other rival cities that claim to have the best Cuban sandwich. After trying this sandwich, I have changed my mind and I must say that Tampa has a great sandwich, and MIchelle Faedo is one of two places that you need to visit.

"I love high tea.. it's truly a passion of mine. I've had high tea in England and since then almost every ""tea house"" experience I have is vastly disappointing. 

This place really tried, I could sense the effort but in almost every aspect Royal Tea House fell short. 
-You didn't get to pick your tea - I don't like being forced into any libation I didn't choose 
-The scones were moist and the clotted cream reminded me of flavorless yogurt 
-they had the right idea with the sandwiches I suppose, but they weren't by any means great - I mean it's a sandwich it's not that hard to mess up 
-the sweets were way TOO sweet 
-Also I'm not sure if this is just me but the whole establishment felt like a bed and breakfast in the middle of nowhere with a bunch of cats (even though royal tea house had no cats) 

I feel like I have unrealistic expectations for high tea since I had the real thing but hey I will always continue my quest to find a tea house that doesn't put me in a bad mood

"June 2018 - love the new happy hour menu.  The meatball sliders are my favorite item they have ever had. The affagoto is also my favorite dessert, add Bailey's or Kahlue to spike it...so good. Fun, comfortable atmosphere. 

A lot to like and I plan to return, but a few negatives as well.  

Innovative, creative menu w/ attention to detail. Unlike anywhere else. High quality ingredients. For the most part, friendly, energetic, well done service. Exception was recent dinner where server was friendly, but was chit chatting with other staff while we waited for her. Pretzel crusted calamari is excellent, with seared lemon a unique addition. Rigatoni w/ short rib ragu, sweet potato ravioli, and side salad were excellent.  Chicken parm was good, but pasta that came with it was sub par - just blah. Surprised that white meat only fried chicken is not an option. I would pay an up charge, let's say along the lines of a $4-6 more, but they will not do it. I feel their fried chicken is their signature and their best dish, such that it is a shame white meat only is not an option. It makes me less likely to order it. Specialty cocktails and spiked icy drinks are fun, unique, and I liked them. The lack of bread is an interesting choice. I wish I had a little bread to sop up the amazing sauce on the ravioli or to go w/ other dishes. I can understand why a restaurant does not want to deal w/ bread (bringing it, refilling it, etc.). But to not even have it as an option is disappointing. Live music Thursday and Fri later in the evening is a nice touch. 

Noise abatement is such that you can hold a conversation. This is lacking in many/most places. Nice to see this tended to. 

Overall I like this place and it has enough going for it to have me coming back. Negatives are not a huge deal breaker, but  would be nice to see considered.

"My son is a student at USF and has praised Bagels Plus for the past two years, but after making my first visit today, I can only assume that his praise was fueled be a lack of sophistication or an excess of alcohol.

Bagels Plus is located in a rundown area of Fletcher (although that may be redundant, given that all of Fletcher seems run down to me).  As Erin S. noted in her review, the interior is clean. Indeed, the bathroom was better than I had expected.  

Staff was friendly, in a ""take us as you find us"" kind of way.  The cashier, who I assume was the owner, was jovial and welcoming.  The girls behind the counter were genuine, if unrefined.

I ordered an egg and cheese sandwich on a pumpernickel bagel.  That is where the real let down of the experience begins.  The bagel was OK.  Texture was good.  Flavor was present but nothing about which to write home.  The cheese seemed very processed and its flavor was annoyingly overwhelming, such that I did not really taste the egg.

Coffee was fair -- better than bad but not what I would call good, either.

On the whiole, my experience was very middle of the road.  Hence three stars.  I do not anticipate becoming a regular, but if in a hurry, I would come back.  Again, as Erin S suggests, next time I will order cream cheese instead of egg and cheese.

"Let me just start this review by saying that if my review was going to be solely based on the drinks, bartender, or waitstaff service it would absolutely be five stars. I went there last weekend with my boyfriend for a date night and we were first off very impressed by the restaurant itself, it was very cute and clean, and we really liked the simple decor. 

When it came time to order our drinks our waiter was so friendly, and when I ordered a drink that they didn't have on the menu he went to the bar to see if they could make it, a peach Bellini. They didn't have it on the menu but the bartender made a peach purée and made the drink for me, it was absolutely delicious. 

The food on the menu looked extremely exciting, and we couldn't decide what to order because it all looks so good. I decided to go with the chicken and waffles, and my boyfriend got the ribs. When the food came the presentation was very nice, but the flavor just wasn't quite there. It was really disappointing considering how amazing our service was, and how amazing the drinks from the bar were. If they could get their food to be on the same page as their service and their bartender, they would definitely get five stars in my book.

If you liked Brasa Grill on Waters Ave. (closed down a few years back), then you will absolutely fall head over heels for Boizao.  Hell, if you hated Brasa Grill, you will love Boizao.  Texas de Brazil, which was originally in Orlando, just expanded to Tampa, and their food is solid, but doesn't compare to Boizao.  Their selection of meats is insane.  The garlic steak and house specials will keep you on high alert waiting for the ""meat guy"" to return.  And the cheese bread (Pao de Queijo) is to die for.  My advice to my fellow yelpers is to go during lunch.  They serve up the same food as they do in the evenings, but for nearly half the price!  It's about $26 per person with a drink (guarana soda).

"For the past 22 years we've driven by this place at least twice a day.  And it used to be really good - especially for the prices.  The parking lot was almost always packed and they did a solid business.  

Then it was sold.  Sold to someone with an attitude of ""I don't care about you"" and a CHEAP mentality.  

And since then, the quality (and quantity of ingredients in the sandwiches) have gone way downhill while the prices have increased $1 to $2 per sandwich.  How does that make sense?!  Their grocery-styled fresh meat section has lost a lot of variety, again while prices have gone up and quality dumped in the crapper.  

Is it any cleaner?  No.  Friendlier?  No.  They got rid of many of the happy / smiling team members and replaced them with people (and a culture of people) that don't seem to know how to smile, say hello, say thank you, etc.  Better food / higher quality?  Hell no!   

We figured it out - our office staff (8 people) purchased lunch there 75 times a year. Average ticket:  $50.  $50 x 75= $3,750.  Now - they'll be lucky to get 6 purchases a year, and that must be when everyone is desperate.  $50 x 6=$300.  I'll personally never go back and neither will my wife after the owner (or perhaps manager) has ignored her several times.

"I used to love to go to this place in their downtown location. I would go 2 or 3 times per month. I went for the first time to this new location and was severely disappointed in the bar tending staff. They charge $2 for ice in your drink.  Not anything fancy or nice cubes, just regular ice you'd get from any bar or restaurant.  Didn't know about this until we got the check and just wanted to politely ask the bartender about this. When approached, the bartender was very defensive and talked down to us saying it was ""standard at cocktail bars"" and asked ""have you ever been to a cocktail bar before?"" Like dude we've been customers of fly bar for years.... I realize it's only $4 on our bill but it's the principle and the reaction from the bartender I'm hung up on.

She read the order back correctly, but when I walked in to get my food, my last name had been changed to 'charashi' and my order was only half right. An extra 15 minutes of my time was wasted on waiting for this food. My constructive criticism for this restaurant: have someone who understands English/ knows the menu answer the phone, allow the customer a refund if the mistake was on your part (which means not saying ""it's already being made"" when I say I've changed my mind on an order seconds after placing it), and air conditioning would be nice... especially if you're going to make patrons wait in the lobby on food that you got wrong multiple times.",7,A,Asian Cuisine,Asian Cuisine,AsianCuisine,1.0,NEGATIVE

"Change is inevitable. Cyber Takee Outee has a new owner. For the loyal regulars, you gotta a lot to adjust. 

My impression of the former CTO was impressive. The taste of his food was bold but still hold on authentic Cantonese flavor. The new owner, however, took a different path. His food is much lighter on all aspects. 

The only fact that determine whether if I should come back to CTO is how hubby's taste buds and stomach reacts to their food. Since he had been spoiled by eating Chinese food for the last two decades in China, I let him do the talk. 

His assessment is, it is not bad for an Americanized Chinese take out. Fresh ingredients and no MSG; Stir-fired vegetable was crunch and not over flowed with garlic. Reheated beef noodle tasted even better. The flavor is not as sophisticate as Chef Li, but it is not a bad alternative for Chinese take-out in case the sky falls. 

It is a standard Chinese takeout. Nothing more and noting less. Staffs are friendly and gave me the impression that they care. I glanced at the owner. He appears confident for his food. Good sign.

"There is a chemical in the food. The composure of my family changed drastically before and after eating 10-20 minutes in. In my youth I was a Major pothead and Drinker as well, not to mention a big Advocate for trying new drugs in college, Wax was like water to me and my old roommates. Not to be a total buzzkill though for you goofs out there, but I'm 100% clean now, and for years- proud to say it because of the jobs that I am called for and hold on to that would never be allowed to me if I hadn't had stopped years ago. Back on to the point- My family started acting like they were drunk or high(good high though/ but dumb/lack of complete focus/awareness- real silly) a few bites in, and we didn't order any drinks, and my family doesn't smoke, I haven't touched something of that keen bijou potency in a Long Time! They did us good with sneaking certain payments in, not to mention our waitress was the most unsteady and dishonest woman when it came to the simplest promises/requests... like can we please get more water because our cups are empty, can I get a Lime- brings a plate full of lemons. Overall, last night's meal was ruined By the People Working There. The crowd and the food's taste itself wasn't bad at all. But if you take a closer look at your receipt the next time any of you go, or take a screenshot like I did since me and  my siblings were going to split the check, you will see their play and loss of integrity with this establishment. Thank you, and good luck out there in this fun yet wacky world, ladies and gents. 

1. Waitress admitted to them having a Free Birthday Sundae for Our Mother since it was her day, but we eventually had to get a Manager at the end of the night to bring her one since the waitress kept forgetting after constant reminders- and then afterwards, altogether said ""sorry, you only get a free desert If you do Not buy another Desert..."" that rule doesn't even make sense... if that is even a rule there!
2. We were charged for 2 Fudge cakes without being told so, it is in the photo
3. Our waitress *Thalia A* was very forgetful(even more than just that Sundae brought up earlier) when asked for Water when our cups were completely empty to the bottom(we do finish our food or drinks) but when we eat... we get thirsty... I hope that's still normal for living beings, or I apologize for wanting more water
4. The other Staff that Aren't Serving You Specifically will be very Rude(Asking the Hostess for help on the Menu!!!, that was Not Busy since she was on her phone- *Maddie Loper*) - I guess that isn't a Host's duty to help people with menus, just stand there to look pretty, and say hi on the phone, but irregardless I was given attitude for asking about a dish on the menu when our waitress wasn't around, yet there was no customer up at the Host Stand. Last but not least, the other Waitresses and Waiters around wiping down tables in our vicinity of the restaurant,  would only say when asking for a refill or the lime... lol, ""I will let your waitress know""... yet I would watch them side by side at the computers and Not Communicate... like... what? The dim lights don't Hide Everything lol!!!
4. Like I said, this was our Mother's birthday, so our waitress went ahead and said that she just didn't to wouldn't sing or do anything other than being the sundae... that she wouldn't bring afterwards.. so ok that part we shouldn't get too upset about, but my younger sister got up and watched when another family sang for their relative's birthday, and she said she noticed an employee joining in.

Either I'm trippin or this establishment needs their staff(not all though since one of them had fun with their table's birthday fam, lol) to tighten up because that isn't the most expensive tab, but not the cheapest either. I've gotten better Service at Ihop and Steak and Shake back in the day and they don't get this kind of money working there! I feel bad for those working their butts off and being kind and courteous at those restaurants, but we come to one like this and we get treated like s#*@. Glad the food had some kind of chemical in it though because me and my fam were laughing at the dumbest things that would pop in our minds... weirdest conversations, but glad our Mother knows nothing about this check's amount dishonesty. We did ask her though at the end, if our waitress did a good job, because we were going to put a good tip because of our dumb high, but even she nodded her head no and we all trippily laughed... my sisters left a small tip. That waitress needs to tighten up because I know others deserve that money.

"I'm in the same boat as everyone else here: menu shoved under my door and too busy working to leave the hotel for food tonight.

They brought someone's order to me after a 60 minute wait (45 min estimate by them). When I opened the box and took off after the deliver guy, he was gone. Called the ""restaurant"" back and they advised ""he grabbed the wrong box: he'll be right back"". That was 90 minutes ago. Stupidly I didn't eat the other person's order, which is cold as hell now, but I really wanted what I paid for. Called back, got a ""He's almost there"". That was about 15min ago. I'm just typing now because I'm extremely hungry and need something to do. I'll certainly update with the result in a bit. But hey, they got my payment, delivery fee and fat tip already so what's their motivation?

##UPDATE##

Food never arrived by 11:15pm. A nice  3+ hours after the initial order and 2 hours after the replacement was promised. Considering I have a flight that leaves in 7 hours, I'm not really into scarfing down the meal I ordered even if it ever is delivered. Now I have to worry about the jackass waking me up as I go to bed hungry.

Too mad to sleep. Called them. The manager blamed ME for the mistake, then hung up on me when I asked for my money back. This is the second worst treatment I've ever had from a restaurant (my Miss Delta review will tell the tale of the worst).

"Out of a handful of boba shops in the Tampa Bay area, my boyfriend and I like this one the best. The staff is not overly friendly but they are always open to giving me opinions on drinks. The first time I came here the girl behind the counter let me try the red and green beans which was very nice. One of the things that keeps us coming back is their boba, it's honestly the best boba I've ever had. They cook their boba in honey and you can definitely tell. They also have a second boba option which is a brown sugar boba which is really good as well but seems to be a little softer and less chewy. Throughout the various times we have went I have ordered: Kung Fu Bubble Milk Tea, Taro Milk Tea/Slush, Lychee Punch, Pina Colada Slush, Oolong Milk Tea, Coconut Milk Tea, Winter Melon Green Tea. My boyfriend is in love with taro and gets it at every boba place we go to. The taro milk tea at KF is different than the others we've been to because you get more of a taste of tea and not a really artificial sweetness (this should be a plus but he actually does not like this factor and likes the slush more for this reason). Every time we go I try to get a different milk tea than the last time. The Oolong, Coconut and regular milk tea all taste pretty similar to me. I liked the Winter Melon Milk Tea because it was nice and sweet and I'm assuming it's because I like green tea more in milk teas. We brought a friend once who got a Pina Colada Slush with mango nata jelly and tasted his- surprisingly not artificial tasting and very nice and creamy. Alongside my boyfriends Taro Slush and one of my milk teas, we get a Lychee Punch with mango nata jelly before we leave to share. Not sure if I get this drink every time because I really like the jelly or what but either way it is delicious. I really like that there are pieces of lychee fruit at the bottom. We have also tried the chicken tenders, edamame, and Honeydew sponge cake. My boyfriend really enjoyed the chicken tenders (yes they are salty and have subtle cinnamon flavor- IT'S BECAUSE THEY HAVE FIVE SPICE ON THEM PEOPLE). The edamame and sponge cake were both nice light snacks though I did not get any Honeydew flavor from the cake...I think it's just vanilla with food coloring lol. Overall I would definitely come here if you haven't yet. The prices are not too great but we both don't spend much on miscellaneous things so the splurge is worth it.

"We went to the Palm on Saturday night specifically for their Summer Lobster special.  It could not be beat.  $99.00 for a four pound lobster dinner for two.
It included two starters and two sides as well as the broiled lobster.
The service is very professional without being overbearing.
The wine list by bot the glass and bottle is stellar.
It's a little noisey but you kind of anticipate that in a classic steakhouse.
My wife had the lobster bisque as a starter.  She said that it was wonderful.
I had the Cesar Salad.  They always serve a great Cesar Salad.
The lobster comes to the table split in two and then a server removes the meat from the claws and knuckles.  How much easier could it be to eat a lobster?
We chose the Hash Brown and Tempura Asparagas as our sides.  They were both wonderful.

"As the original first customer to order their food when it opened back in 2011.... I have to say the garlic knots were by far the high standard of what a true delicious greasy, garlicky taste should be in a bread. Even til this day, no other pizza joint has topped or met the high standard as this amazing side app has become to our knowing for ordering a pie. However, when i decided to come back and try their place again, I was a it disappointed in the knots when I tried it 5 yrs ago. But, it's still the best Knotts toucan find in the Bay Area. Maybe the standards went down alittle?? Who knows. As far as the pie goes, it's your typical NY style pizza. Nothing special. You can get the same pizza from any other pizzeria joint. Does not differentiate from other places like Eddie, Cappy's, Detroit etc. all of them has them one special pie that makes it better and it's unique to other local mom n pop shop. The pies are really thin and the red sauces are not used as much as it should be. For the price you pay on their specialty.. Pretty bad. Bc you can a better overall pie cheaper from other places with its unique style to it. Is it recommendable? Yes bc of the knots. Def. stop by for the Knotts. You'll see how they really make this their #1 seed and he showcase to cow over ho this small little pizzeria shop. Oh yeah, true NYorkers. But it doesn't make the pizza any better than others in the Bay Area.",11,A,Slice Masters NY Pizzeria,Slice Masters NY Pizzeria,Slice Masters NY Pizzeria Inc.,4.0,NEGATIVE

Delayed Valentines dinner! Found a place without the usual price fixed blah blah menu. 
Space is a huge wine store - not total wine huge, but pretty good size - specialty vi yards and small batch places available.
The food-bar area is a U shaped bar, very knowledgeable bartender who was friendly and gave us great food wine pairings. Champagne with cheese curds? Who knew? 
We choose the 5 item cheese and meat board which was HUGE and so good. 
Next we split the steak and fries: pommes frites - with bearnaise schmear and having just spent 2 weeks in Italy, we HAD to order the bucatini - it sounded amazing but it wasn't so amazing g- pasta a bit more cooked than I prefer and a very eccentric carbonara (aka not carbonara) but do remember I'm a very picky about my pasta so they still get a 5 star, that's how much I enjoyed our valentine day.

"Well, I had been to Uncle Mikes a few times before, and the food was good, but the service extremely slow and the waitress seemed confused.                                      Visited during the Biker Sunday, and it was a somewhat dreary day.  A few bikers in the back building and live music...Main building full...Church folk and some bikers; bar area busy too.                                                                                                               Not sure what was going on, whether it was poor planning, or the change over from moving the entire business from the Brandon location to the Plant City one, but right off the bat the waitress informed us they were out of pulled pork...ordered milk....waitress came back informed us they were out of milk.  Ordered pizza from the kids menu, and they did not have that either.  Salad bar was nearly empty, and there were at least ten other groups in the place.                                                                My St. Louis ribs were good, but did not get offered a choice of sauces like I did on my original visit.  Wait for food was very long, and the waitress did not offer any refill on drink or additional trip to salad bar as an inkind gesture.                                          Finally, when the bill came, the waitress didn't even have a pen for me an had to ask around for one.                                                                                                            My review is not mean't to be be mean or against this place, because I know the food is generally very good, but improvements definitely could be made, and very simply as well.   Families with kids need to be served more readily do to the kids getting bored and creating anxious parents....  Give crayons with coloring menu!  Tell the people about the salad bar instead of assuming they know.  Keep the drinks filled and let the people know that you have not forgotten them.  Oh, and on a day like it was on Sunday, coffee would have been nice.  Did not see that offered on the menu.   And finally, I noticed that there was plenty of parking, but the trees could use a bit of trimming back, and RV parking offered...(This would be a great stopping spot for RVers.",24,B,Uncle Mikes Smokehouse Grill,Uncle Mikes Smokehouse Grill,Uncl3 Mik3s Smok3hous3 Grill,2.0,NEGATIVE

Sometimes, it's a little unnerving to patronize a business if you know the owners. What if you're not satisfied? Well, no worries with that at Your Kitchen Cafe Grill. I honestly enjoyed every bite! I had a veggie omelet, filled with onions, peppers, mushrooms and tomatoes. The grits were a great consistency. My daughter had a chicken omelet filled with flavorful chicken, and topped with melty cheddar cheese. Her breakfast potatoes were my favorite part of the meal. I may or may not have stolen them when she wasn't looking!! LOL We ordered some Cuban bread to go with our meal. It was crispy and toasted and delicious!

They have other options like salmon and chicken but I can't say much about those since I don't partake in eating animals. 

There's usually a long line but it goes quickly. My boyfriend and I can eat at IKEA for lunch for less than $10 each. There's a ton of seating and they also serve dessert. Although none of them are vegan so far that I've seen but they look good and fresh.

"I visited The Flattery last night while it was parked outside of The Imperial. I saw it at the Winter Park Food Truck Stop this past Thursday and maybe even a time or two before that, but never tried any of the truck's food until last night.

I ordered the ""Thai-My-Shoe"" flatbread, which features plum sauce, chicken, Thai peanut sauce, scallions, cilantro, cucumbers and Chow Mein noodles (and perhaps more; I forgot to take a picture of the menu and now am unsure if I got all of the ingredients down on my phone). Anyone who knows me very well can attest to my love of Thai peanut sauce as well as Thai food, so I just had to order this flatbread. (There were at least two other very intriguing flatbreads on last night's menu so, even though I ordered this one, the decision was pretty difficult.) It was excellent! The flatbread was crispy and the toppings were delicious. I already can't wait to see this truck again so that I can try this flatbread a second time or try one of the others for the first.

The Flattery is on both Facebook (www.facebook.com/TheFlattery) and Twitter (@TheFlattery), so ""like""/""follow"" the truck at those two sites, respectively, for the latest. It does have a website, www.theflattery.com, but it doesn't seem to be working at this time.

Credit/debit cards are accepted, and each flatbread from last night's menu was either $7 or $8. (Mine was $8.) It's enough food for one person and is filling, though if you're with someone or just are into sharing then you might consider ordering two different ones and having some of both. I may have to bring someone with me next time so that I can try more than one.

For now, 4 stars ... though this definitely has the potential to be bumped up to 5/5. I have to try it at least once more, and hopefully sooner rather than later.",3,A,The Flattery,The Flattery,The Fl@ttery,4.0,NEGATIVE

"Awesome dining experience from the beginning to the end at this new restaurant. They have just been open for three weeks now, &  I can't wait to bring my friends and family.

When you first look at their menu, you will see that you are up for a selection of food from many different countries. Some examples of this are their cuban mojo pork shank, scotch egg, pho soup, greek salads, greek lasagna, Brazilian picanha, chicken with limoncello sauce, meatballs, eggplant parmesan, and Chilean salmon specials.

When you check in with the Yelp app, you can get a free appetizer. We picked the steak, mushroom, a& cheese flatbread. They make flatbreads, & others entrees, & their baked oysters in their wood fired oven.  The flatbread was alright, but needed something to kick it up a notch. We asked for balsamic glaze to drizzle on our flatbread, and that's what made it perfect. The flatbread is a good size with about 6 triangle shaped slices. It could be shared with two or three people depending on your appetite, and whatever else you order.

Shari, our waitress was a breath of fresh air. She was very genuine & helpful with picking out our entrees. She first got me a berry martini which was a special I saw on the chalkboard by the bar. It was $5. I also asked how the sangria was, so she brought me a sample of the sangria. The sangria was not as sweet as I would have liked it, but I did like my berry martini. She described it like a berry gummi bear.

When we picked our entree, Shari first told us about the specials. They are on the chalkboard also by the oyster bar, & wood fired oven.  Some of the options included a southwest chicken flatbread, and filet mignon and salmon.  

We did choose to pick the two specials. The filet mignon was served with Jack Daniels Creme sauce with fingerling potatoes and basmati rice. The salmon was served with a limoncello sauce along with mixed veggies including yellow squash, zucchini, and red peppers, with fingerling potatoes. They made the salmon in the wood fired oven, so it had the perfect crust on the salmon as well as the potatoes were crunchy outside and soft inside. Both of these entrees were perfectly seasoned, and had great flavor.

Afterwards, Shari let us know about the desserts. We said we would pass. She surprised us and brought us two samples of their dessert options including rice pudding with Lingonberries and an Italian chocolate caramel custard. These desserts were a perfect cherry on top.

This restaurant also has a full bar with a great selection of beer, wine, and mixed drinks. You can also sit by the bar to get that personal experience. You can sit outside with your dog. The outside decorations with bamboo are a nice touch.

All in all, service was exceptional. Shari, our waitress was super helpful, and the owner came around to check on us. We loved the atmosphere. Our food was delicious.

The place looks fantastic, they did an amazing use of space and remodeled the place to fit the Taino theme perfectly. For an appetizer we had the mamasushi and I was so excited because I found it so innovative! . The ""sushi"" roll was cold, was not expecting the salami, cheese and rest of ingredients to be cold and a bit tough. As the main entrees we had the yucafongo. One with churrasco one with chicken. The churrasco was hard to chew and pretty flavorless. The chicken's sauce was overwhelming but the actual chicken piece didn't taste like much... and the most disappointing part was that the yuca was more like a yuca mash, breaded and fried. Looks fantastic, but lacked in flavor. I was waiting for so long following in social media, waiting on that grand opening... wishing I could make it my go to spot, and I'm not sure if we are willing to give it another chance.

In case your not living on the same planet as everyone else there's a pandemic going on. The city allowed restaurants to open with the instruction that masks be worn by employees.

It has not lost the magic that I experienced 8 years ago!! I don't have pictures because you dig into Riverside food! There is no time for pictures. I ordered fried oysters as an appetizer and the grilled fish meal with basa fish, yellow rice and broccoli. I walked into my office and EVERYONE was asking what I was eating, coming over and no one could believe it was fish because it smelled so good! I heard that there is now a Riverside in Zephyrhills, which is closer to me! I hope it's true because it's been almost a decade since I last had it and it was worth the wait!

"What really impressed me with the chaufa was the texture of the rice. The firm bite of each grain was a sign that they used the right kind of rice: old rice. Fresh rice has too much moisture to make good fried rice so the chef knows their stuff. In addition, the portion was gargantuan, and I had enough left to be dinner at night. There's also a good amount of well cooked seafood mixed into it. You definitely get your money's worth. 

If anything could improve, the rice could have more wok hei. I think the issue is that there's just too much stuff and sauces in the wok. If there was less rice and less soy sauce, the wok might be able to sear in more flavor. I would be ok with compromising some of the portion size to make it more delicious.",40,C,Machu Picchu Restaurant,Machu Picchu Restaurant,MachuPicchuRestaurant,4.0,POSITIVE

I was slowly greeted by a young lady who was stuck behind her personal device to say ""hello"" as if I was entering her house not a place of business.  I was told to sit wherever and no that instructions. Menus are now a Q scan code.

Ever, ever, ever had to use salt and pepper on my food at a Latin place or (any place for that manner). The food was horrible!?! I couldn't believe that the cozy, comfort, fun, loving place was gone.

"When you're sick of the burgers and fried chicken, or in my case sick of looking for decent meat alternatives on fast food menus, Byblos is a great place to go.  Pitas are nothing new in this area, but Byblos makes them very well and the staff tends to be a little more competent than the other places.  

When I go, I mostly go for their falafel and hummus, but I have also had the chicken and it flavorful and not too dried out like most sandwich places tend to do.  The falafel is flavorful without being overly heavy, and you're able to pick out what you want on it from a selection of toppings that would make Subway doubletake.  Their hummus is also made fresh and is refreshing plain instead of being loaded down with garlic or other unnecessary flavors.  Oh, and it's not ground into paste- it's nice and chunky the way I like it.

This is definitely a fast food place, and you'll be paying about $16 for two people to get a pita and share a drink and a side, but in the end I think it's worth it for the better food quality and something different.",13,A,Byblos Pitas,Byblos Pitas,ByblosPitas,4.0,POSITIVE

"Funny story... I was a vegetarian for 12 years and decided to start eating meat again a few years ago. When it came to where I wanted to try meat again, I went straight to Hattricks and ordered 20 shake and bake wings and loved every minute of it. Needless to say, I LOVE Hattricks.

Their wings are seriously the greatest in Tampa. I'm currently drooling thinking of their well done shake and bake wings (the only way to order them). I can't even explain how great they are. Shake and Bake is an option which means fried wings, tossed in sauce then baked in the oven. The sauce essentially dries out while they bake, leaving them mess free. They are super crispy and out of this world delicious. 

Aside from their wings, I'm obsessed with their chicken philly sandwich and almost always have to order wings and a chicken philly since I know how awesome both are. The chicken philly is served on soft bread and has oozing cheese throughout the sandwich. It's one of those sandwiches that makes you close your eyes and appreciate the moment when you're eating it.

Hattricks is one of those places I take out of towners to blow them away! If you're going on a game or concert night, it can definitely get crowded in there. Can't wait to get back to Hattricks for more of their delicious food!",39,C,Hattricks,Hattricks,Hattricks,5.0,POSITIVE

"So I have been here about 5-7 times now and I feel I can properly give this place a five star review. I have ordered delivery and went in the store. Each has the same quality of food and what I order. Sometimes when you order delivery the food can be disappointing or off than what your expecting, but this hasn't happened to me.

The last time we were here, they were closing within the hour. The staff was still just as friendly as they would be if it were in the middle of the day. Sometimes they may give you extra when they are closing to avoid food waste ;-) this happened twice. I may or may not have purposely come when they were about to close to reap this benefit lol

This is a healthier option if you want to make it that way or you can totally just pile on whatever you want. I usually get the regular bowl with salad as a base. I couldn't decide one day between grilled chicken and gyro chicken. The girl let me try both and suggested the gyro chicken because it was more flavorful. She was right! I pretty much get the same thing every time. Which is all the toppings offered lol you cannot beat the price for how much food you get!! The value and taste definitely makes it five stars.

Creamy filling, packed with crab and seasonings in a flaky shell, BUT the portion size was super small and each of the 4 pieces was like a bite and a half. We expected more. 

Same kind of holds true for the sushi here, too. It's amazing - fresh, quality cuts of fish. In season veggies. Creative and unique rolls. However, it never seems like you get a lot, especially for the price.  The Spontaneous Combustion Roll is probably my favorite sushi roll of all time. Anywhere. It's salmon and crab and cream cheese and avocado and a few other things all wrapped in seaweed paper and baked with white fish and spicy mayo on top. It practically melts in your mouth, it's so smooth and creamy on the inside. BUT, again, it's super small. Each little piece is probably no bigger than the size of a quarter around.

We were waiting long enough that I'm half way finished my food so I called her up to reminded her she came ""okey I will check"" then about 5 mins later she came with the orders, put them down and say ""sorry guys they were waiting for fries and that was my fault"" (yes of cause what do you think lol) but i said ""that's ok it happens"" lol second I ordered bacon burger and I want my burger medium, I received well done which is fine I'm not picky. My baby who's 2 years old she wants the cheese burger, (this I couldn't stand) her burger came out medium.. the beef inside still bloody and cold! So I called the waitress to let her know and send the food back, she came with attitude with both hands on her hips and asked me ""what's wrong?"" So I replied ""I'm sorry but this burger is uncooked, u must misunderstood me I want my burger medium and my baby meal should be well done"" She goes ""oh sorry but they always cook like this the same way.. well let's see what I can do?"" 5 mins Later the manager came with new burgers for my baby however one burnt and another one cook just about right so I take that. Think hey we are human thing like this happened and My baby wouldn't finish both burgers. Third my friend ordered pasta, she specifically say she wants the broccoli cooked and soft... Ofcause broccolis came uncooked and very crunchy lol so she politely addressed that with the waitress.. didn't want anything just want to let her know because when she ordered it the waitress even said she wants her broccoli cooked also but again shit happens later the waitress brought boiled extra broccolis for my friend which we didn't asked for.. with atttitude ofcoz But it's good here. Forth the Caesar salad which is my another friend ordered as a side was totally nasty! How hard to cook Caesar salad? It looks like a dog puke! We all gave it a try but omg nasty, cold, lettuces looks old and saggy! So we left it alone! After all these melt down I guess the manager smell our silent angers, she came to apologized and offered free dessert.. but we didn't even want nothing from the kitchen no more! Later the waitress came for the check, she also offered us with her attitude ""if you want it's on the House"" kind of offer..  lol my 2 years old wants some dessert due she didn't finish her one edible little burger And I didn't even bother asking for box to take home! So we gave the last chance to make it right.. my baby ordered caramel crunch cake.. the cake looks old so we didn't even touch it only took ice cream part. Last part we split the bills I paid with credit card, my friend paid with cash.. the waitress didn't bring back her change. So my friend asked for the change back.. she gave us the look, and say ""oh you want a change back?"" (Err yes! Even tough we should pay 10% doesn't mean you have a right to keep our change without our permission) that's it! I was gonna leave 10% tips as a good manner for dining and cleaning! I didn't leave none! (Never in my life did that!) I honestly disappointed.. and she deserves not even 1 penny from me. Neither from my friends. How could you served uncooked meat to a toddler? Common sense! Btw I rather pay for McDonald's because seriously I have never had any problem with my kid meal! I can say i will never ever go back to this location ever again and I'm considering to stop going to Ruby Tuesday Because the price is equally TGIF or other chain restaurant. I can't believe this location still haven't closed from health department. The restaurant smell like mud, only positive I would say it was my raspberry tea.

"Unless you're staying at the Sheraton Hotel in Westshore (which is where this restaurant is located in) or have a coupon from restaurant.com, there's really no reason to come here.  There's tons of restaurants in that area with better, similar priced steaks.  Even with the coupon, our tab still came out well over 100+ for 4 people.

FOOD:  My prime rib was well cooked however under seasoned.  They ran out of dinner bread because there was a large party happening in their event hall which took precedence over the rest of the restaurant.  Their grouper sandwich was surprisingly good.  It was well seasoned, well cooked and not overly fishy. In fact, it may be the best fish sandwich I've ever had 

SERVICE:  We had a sweet server named Julie who was prompt and on top of everything despite being the only one working the entire restaurant.  She was very sorry about the bread even though it wasn't her fault.  I was really sad about not being able to stuff my face with the dinner rolls but the apology made it all better

Would I come here again?  Yea, but only to ask out Julie on a date.  (I hope my girlfriend doesn't read this)

I first went to Little Saigon off Armenia back in the 90's with an exgirlfrend and found out there was a place on Fowler closer to where I usually lurk....I literally have never been disappointed, except for twice; when they took a particular peice of art off the wall, and no Banh Mi. Trifling,I admit. BUT - the pho special is my true comfort food, and only Mom does food that makes me feel like Trang's Pho. I will embarass myself and others by lifting the bowl to my lips to get the last of that broth out. I even went vegan there (gasp!) and had the vegan happy pancake....My laws, it was good!

I am however dedicated to finding the perfect pho in Tampa so ventured here when it first opened under new management .It's cool that they are doing the yelp check in and you get a free appetizer . Their Pho broth is decent and mildly sweet. They do have a good deal where you get half a banh mi sandwich with a small soup. Beware, the soup small but you get what you pay for. It's more like kid sized. You can pay an extra $1 to get a whole sandwich. The place is located inside a strip mall next to a barber shop on west waters. It's convenient with parking available.

The owner came over to our table a few times to inject into our conversation, which I thought was funny. He was nice, as was our waitress.

"Overall the best I can give after the interesting dining experience we had...is a 3 star review. We stayed at the hotel after the Bucs game and decided to eat here before leaving town. I'm sad we did. The empty restaurant should have been the indicator that something was amiss.
 The table of newly children-LESS mothers sitting in the corner cackling about how relieved they were than school had beckoned their little angels back for another school year. Their conversations ebbed and flowed about children, spouses, employment and errant inlaws. Why do I know these things? Because I was only sitting 20 feet from them in a nearly empty restaurant and hear their big mouths anyway! 
The only other table was an elderly man and his aide trying to have breakfast and they were clearly annoying him because in his loudest voice *despite having difficulty speaking, yelled across the room for them to shut up. 
They never even heard him. 
We ordered coffee corned beef hash, eggs and potatoes. Cuban toast.  Meal decent. Cooked to order. Arrived promptly. Solid chow.

India is known for its curries, tandoori items etc. and flames cusine pays homage to that. I was ecstatic to find Lamb biryani  here with along with the aforementioned tandoor items - something that you would only find in a true Indian cusine! For about a few $, I was more than happy with the food choices, and can't really complain. I've paid a lot more for a lot less - quality and quantity wise.

"This is a really nice market for any produce from Asia.  But, I would not drive out of my way to go here.  It just so happens to be close to one of my favorite Indian restaurants, so sometimes I stop by out of convenience.

The major things to note about this market compared to other shops in Tampa is:
1. Larger selection of spiritual, personal care, and beauty products.
2. Variety of teas
3. Produce specials

As others have noted, the market is super clean.  However, just like any local market, make sure to check the expiration dates on all of the items before you buy them.  

Typically, when I shop at 27 Mart, I stock up on dry spice mixes that are noted for specific dishes.  They come in a box with the name of the dish and a photo on the outside.  Sometimes they are on sale for $0.99, and it is enough seasons to use for two meals.

"I'm not that familiar with Tampa but the neighborhood doesn't look the greatest and from the outside NoHo isn't impressive -- it looks like it used to be a liquor store.  But it's nice inside with some scenic murals on the walls that somewhat make up for the lack of windows. Although come to think of it, considering the neighborhood perhaps the lack of windows is a good thing.

There are some very interesting items on the menu.  To start, bison chili, middle eastern salads, and the wild mushroom-swiss dip caught our attention. We settled on the mushroom-swiss dip with crostini.  It was pretty good, made with a mellow swiss, but I still kinda wish we had tried the chili.

We were having a hard time deciding on entrees, there were a number of things we wanted to try.  Finally, since the prices are so low, we decided to order three entrees for the two of us.

The butternut squash risotto has a pretty strong sage flavor to it.  Since it was really more of a side for us, it worked -- we liked it a lot, but I'm not so sure the sage wouldn't be a bit much if it was a sole entree for someone.

The roast pork loin was OK. Don't get me wrong, there wasn't anything wrong with it. It's just that there wasn't anything special about it either.  I did like the crushed sweet potatoes that came with it. A hint of cinnamon & a hint of honey but not too sweet.  Very nicely done.

The lamb & veal meatloaf was fantastic.  I don't really know how to describe it since I have no comparison point. I haven't had any kind of meatloaf since I was a kid & I hated it then so I've avoided it ever since.  This meatloaf wasn't swimming in grease & it seemed to be mostly meat rather than bread crumbs or some other filler.  Whatever it was, it worked for me.

For dessert we had a lemon tartlet and chocolate-orange pots de crème. The tart was perfect -- nice & tart instead of sticky & sweet.  But to me it was blown away by the pots de crème.  Absolutely delicious.  I can't remember now which it was, but I loved the infusion of either grand marnier or cointreau. The bitter orange kept it from being too sweet. (Sensing a theme here? Yeah, I don't like sweet desserts.)

"Today started out with some early morning conference calls followed by a long drive across the state, and so I felt compelled to eat something healthy for breakfast without spending hours and hours at a diner.

I remembered that there is an Einstein Bros. Bagel spot near my condo, so I zipped around the corner and went through the drive-through to snag a toasted bagel with a fruit cup for breakfast. The bagel was freshly-made earlier this morning, and when toasted it had the perfectly crunchy outer crust, with the warm, soft inner dough. This was much better than the frozen crap that you can buy at your local mega-mart and then try to re-heat in a toaster oven.

I ordered a toasted sesame seed bagel with a schmear of lite veggie cream cheese, and also ordered a fruit cup of fresh citrus, melon and berries. Everything was perfect -- though a little pricey, but since someone else was cooking I didn't complain.

Einstein has many different styles / flavors of bagels and toppings for breakfast, including bagel breakfast sandwiches. You can request packs of bagels, cream cheese and coffee all packed up to go for you and your office mates.  If you visit later in the day you'll see bagel gourmet luncheon sandwiches, paninis, wraps, salads, and soups.

2. The pizza. Order however you want, it's always good.

The whole ""I root for my hometown team"" drama is worn out and cheesy. Support Tampa you morons, you idiots live here now.

"2.5 Stars

Decent Thai food with some good items, and some fails.

Fried tofu to start with was marginal - it was very bland with almost no flavor, and didn't have the silky interior that I love. However, the Larb Gai appetizer, chicken mixed with chili powder, scallions, mint leaves, Thai herbs and lime juice served with sliced cabbage, was outstanding, with a fabulous, fresh flavor.

For my entrée I had the Amazing, which was anything but.  Served cool, with a cloying, sweet brown sauce on top, it was almost inedible.  I sent it back to be warmed up, but that just made it even worse. My boyfriend had their special fried rice which he liked, but they must have gotten their 'heat level' confused, because his ordered medium was extra fiery.

Service was just okay. They had two waiters in the restaurant, and while they were attentive at first, that dropped off as more tables arrived.  It's been ten or so years since I tried this place, and it will probably be that long before I go back.",35,C,Siam Thai Restaurant,Siam Thai Restaurant,T0p Thai Restaurant,3.0,POSITIVE

"A recent talk thread in the Yelp Tampa chats concerned fresh Florida seafood, and people were asking where is the best place to find really good fish and shellfish. Despite rumors to the contrary, fresh Florida seafood is not found in the frozen foods section of your grocery store in a cardboard box featuring some guy from Gloucester, Massachusetts wearing a yellow raincoat, or some kindly old grandmother hawking fish sticks. 

No, if you want to find fresh Florida seafood you need to look for the fishing boats, and follow them to the closest seafood market.

That is exactly what you'll find at Southern Seafood located along South Westshore Boulevard in between Bay to Bay and El Prado. This little seafood market and restaurant is located right next to the Gun Branch Cut off of Tampa Bay. As you travel south on Westshore, watch for the sign advertising the Westshore Center strip mall, and turn in there.

On the far end of this little strip center is Southern Seafood, and as their slogan advertises ""From Our Boats To Your Kitchen"". Owner Susan Micek and her team spend the day trolling the waters along the west coast of Florida looking for the very freshest of seafood to put into their refrigerated cases for sale. On the day I was there, the blackboard specials were advertising grouper, snapper, sea bass, mahi mahi, tuna, swordfish, shrimp, mussels, scallops, stone crabs, and much more.

The front half of the store is the seafood market with lots of fresh fish and shellfish options loading up the display cases. Basically if it's on the blackboard then they have it in the coolers. The back half of the store is set up as a lunch counter with about 10 stools overlooking the grill. Pick your fish from the display case, and let them handle the cooking. You can order sandwiches, Po' Boys, salads, and tacos.

Chef Dijon and I chatted about the various kinds of grouper that were freshly-caught and available for purchase including red grouper, grouper cheeks, and the very delicious gag grouper which is a sweeter and milder-tasting fish. I asked the Chef to make me a blackened gag grouper sandwich, loaded all the way with hush puppies on the side. While he was busy cooking I enjoyed a serving of their smoked fish dip with some crackers and chatted away with the Chef.

The fish sandwich was out-of-this-world fresh. The grouper was served up golden brown and delicious on a toasted bun with lettuce, tomato, onion, and pickles. I added a splash of hot sauce, and sunk my teeth into something very tasty.

Southern Seafood is perfect for lunch, or an early casual dinner. They close up the kitchen about 6:30, so get there early.

My coworker treated me to lunch here today & while for the most part I enjoyed my lunch, like Stephanie D. I just wasn't wowed. Or even really satisfied. I have to totally agree -- nothing struck me as *fresh*, & while when I was eating I couldn't put my finger on what about these otherwise decent rolls was off, I realize that yes: they were pretty much warm. NOT good. Also, the rice should be stickier -- it wasn't as dry as I've been unfortunate enough to encounter at some places, but it left me wanting.

& this may sound odd to the American observer who's used to bigger = better, but their rolls were too big. They need to be packed down tighter, so they can be popped into the mouth in one bite. Even a small mouth (like mine). My companion's got a big mouth & even he seemed to be struggling a little bit; I managed -- but barely.

In short, it was a decent enough lunch & I sure won't argue with free, but neither I nor my coworker will be returning here if we can help it.",1,A,Cafe Japon,Cafe Japon,Cafe Jap0n,2.0,NEGATIVE

You'll have a hard time choosing just one, so I suggest you get several! I have never seen a place like this in Florida and it rivals the best bakeries of California! The buns are so beautiful you almost don't want to eat them, emphasis on the 'almost' :) I had the butter white bun first, and it is so soft and delicious, the craisin (raisin?) on top was the perfect amount of tart to accent the sweet buttery cream and bread. I'm a sucker for cream! We also had the Japanese cheesecake which is by far the best I've had in Florida! I am from St. Petersburg and I made the drive up here just for the bakery and it was definitely worth it! You definitely need to try it, there's just no place like it! It's very clean and safe as well, I felt very comfortable having a coffee a quick bun bite before heading back on the road, if I could give it 10 stars I could!

"Unfortunately this restaurant was a huge disappointment. It is overpriced and done very poorly.  
Our server was MIA the entire night. We ran out of water more than once. She never came to check on us after the food came. Unfortunately the steaks were cold. Someone who I assume was the manager (he never introduced himself) came to check on us and we told him the steaks were cold. He took our steaks back into the kitchen and came back with the same ones a few minutes later. They were still cold. He told us the steaks would be over cooked if they were hot. We have eaten medium filet at several other restaurants and even made it at home, it's never cold when it's cooked properly.  He did offer to remake the steaks at that point but it seemed like a waste of high quality piece of meat so we ate the cold and under seasoned meat. The scalloped potatoes were good. For a $90 meal you are better off at iavarone's or sacred pepper or pretty much anywhere else. 
Our server 'became aware' of the cold steaks after we got the check and offered free dessert. The manager also offered free dessert. While we appreciate the effort, the overall message we got was that we expected way too much. Expecting a hot steak that was properly cooked seemed to be viewed as very unreasonable, and that it was our fault we didn't like it. 
The menu is very small and very expensive so we expected each thing we ordered to be done very well. This was not the case.

If you want authentic Italian-Greek-Lebanese cuisine, come here. I ordered a pickup. They had gluten free options for some of my friends that have gluten sensitivity.

I ordered cheese pizzas to go - the dough was super smooth that was used as it was fluffy when we had the pizzas.

"Tried their cupcakes from the food truck with the family we ordered the following:

Chocolate on chocolate (delicious and moist cake, the chocolate icing was super light)
Coconut (slightly bland- you could smell the alcohol from the extract)
Chocolate Mint (just like the ice cream, but didn't really work for me)
Strawberry vanilla (slightly bland, the icing is nice and light)
Red Velvet (delicious cake, I'm not a fan of cream cheese, but it was delicious)
Lemon (once again great icing, but slightly dry cake)

Overall opinion:
The chocolate cakes are very moist and delicious, their vanilla and other white cakes were slightly dry for us, also nothing was incredibly innovative but that may just have been the day's selection. However all of their icing is just sweet enough and so light it tasted like whipped cream. Definitely will want to try some of their more adventurous flavors in the future, or maybe some of their cookies.",31,C,Enjoi Sweets & Company,Enjoi Sweets & Company,Enjoi Sweets & Company Inc.,4.0,POSITIVE
"We were so excited to finally go to Willa's Provisions. Given their recent reputation and reputation of Willa's we had high expectations. They've done a great job branding, marketing and designing both restaurants and we loved the vibe. Even with the great vibe, it was hard to overcome the disappointment with the food. We ordered two of their breakfast tacos and their bacon brioche breakfast sandwich. The food wasn't terrible but highly disappointing with the highlight being the green herbaceous bright salsa that came with the tacos. The food is pre-made, what seems to be that same morning possibly, but the sandwich and tacos are wrapped and stored and then given out as people order them. This creates a very soggy tortilla and mushy consistency to the filling and shell of the taco. The sandwich handled slightly better, but the cheese looked almost like a sauce given how melted it had become. The brioche was slightly too sweet, but the bacon was a nice relief. Overall the food wasn't terrible but missed expectations for a cafe style breakfast at $8 a sandwich and $4 for each taco. I'd recommend tweaking the menu and adding made-to-order items, other wise I'd suggest visitors to go to other breakfast restaurants and cafe's such as King State or Buddy Brew.",34,C,Willa’s Provisions,Willa’s Provisions,Willa’s Provisions,2.0,NEGATIVE

"Today I went to pick up my 1/4 ham, that I ordered a few days ago. I get there around 10:30 am and stood in a line outside of the store, to get in. As I was standing in line, they were calling the people in that had prepaid to go in and get their orders. After standing in line, finally getting inside and all the way to the register, I was told that a truck hadn't shown up and they didn't have any 1/4 hams. Only 1/2 hams. The ham I was going to purchase was just for my father and I. I didn't need 1/2 a ham. However, feeling rushed to make a decision with it being Christmas Eve and trying to weigh my options, quickly, I just said fine and got the 1/2 ham ( they did give me 10% off). My issue is not with the fact that the truck didn't arrive with the smaller hams. My issue is that while they were calling people in that had pre paid, they could've announced that they were out of the smaller hams. I could've had some time in line to weigh my options, instead of making a split second decision at the register and spending more money and eating a 1/2 ham for the next week, lol. It just seems like they could've done better. I should've just said no thanks and gone to Cacciatore Brothers and bought some fat steaks and called it a day. Needless to say, as delicious as I'm sure the ham will be, I won't be ordering one again, to get to the store and them not have my order.",13,A,Honey Baked Ham Company,Honey Baked Ham Company,Honey B@ked H@m Comp@ny,1.0,NEGATIVE

The sides are either and extra scoop of chicken salad, a fruit bowl, Mac and cheese, grape salad, and other salad options.

"Easter 2013 - FAIL

This was our first time to the Rusty Pelican.  I had heard great things about this restaurant and had hoped for an opportunity to go.  My family came down to visit me from out of state for Easter and had hoped for a delicious, memorable experience and boy was it a poor choice on my part.  Shame on you Rusty Pelican!  SHAME SHAME SHAME.  We made our way to the restaurant and were very pleased with the building, the valet parking and the check in process for the reservations.  We arrived at 1:45 pm, our valet took our cars quickly and we proceeded to the girl out front.  She quickly pulled up our name and asked us to step in.  We were quickly taken to our table and were seated at the window.  The restaurant brags that every seat has a view with or without a window ( they are not exaggerating ) no matter where you sit here you feel you have a great view and table.  This would be a great place to go for THE VIEW when a storm is coming in ( the view !!! ).  The easter buffet is high priced than the normal buffet from what I have read so we were hoping for a delicious experience!  Our waiter quickly came to our table and explained how the buffet works and took our drink order and we exited our table to enter the room.  There were I must say plenty of choices and presentation was appropriate.  I had the gorgonzola pork loin, some veggies for my first trip and my family chose other items.  We returned to our table to find - no drinks.  Our drinks were pretty simple, two mumosas, two waters for the kids.  Finally another woman asked us had we ordered our drinks, we said yes but we hadn't received them yet, she said she would bring them over which she did.  We began eating - the food was poor, it was room temperature, nothing was remarkable.  We ate and decided to go back again, choosing a different item.  We had ham and lamb.  Returning the ham was tough and unimaginably dry and the lamb was room temp and impossible to chew.  Giving up on dinner we chose to head to the deserts.  There was an ample selection but if you if you are going to have a flowing chocolate fountain my GOD make sure that you keep the fruits stocked and someone cleaning the area!  It was very messy, I got two mini strawberries and there was chocolate everywhere.  I feel so taken advantage of after a party of 4 for a $50 dollar per person buffet that we left feeling as if we had gone to Golden Corral.  You can't expect your view to make up for room temperature food and lackluster service.  I am a Tampa resident and of course I have family and friends coming here all the time to visit at various times through the year but I'm sorry I can't recommend this place at all.  I would like to say I'd like to give it another try because the views are incredible but if I wanted a view like that I would go to a beach and not feel as if I was being robbed at the same time.  Please Rusty Pelican - you have to spruce that 'stuff up and have the staff to make sure your delivering a memorable experience each and everytime if you want people to come back.  For that price I should have been licking my lips and sadly I left for what I thought would be a fantastic experience for my family wanting to go to McDonalds and grab a Big Mac.

We ordered 7 dishes and half of them were way too salty - cannelloni ( my favorite out of all  yet too salty) , some of the olives, bread with tomatoes. Boiled octopus was a HUGE disappointment! Barely a bite of octopus and flavorless potatoes. For 15$ no no no. I order octopus everywhere I can and this was the worst. Best dishes that we liked- Serrano ham - melts in your mouth. Meat balls delicious. Jalapeño ceviche- just enough spice and freshness. Drinks- I had 2 different sangrias- Blanca and Cerveza. While interesting, traditional sangria I prefer better.

"The online coupon business is strong with this one. We like them and we bought one for this place. I decided to update the review. Sorry guys, I wish this place did better. 

The waitress was much better than the waiter we had before. There was a live singer who was OK, but his volume was too high for such a small dining room. I like the Italian place with a singer, but he used a taped minus one track and the effect was more annoying than entertaining. One problem is TVs, if you are fine dining like the prices purport, you don't need televisions in the dining room. Maybe one in the bar, but this place is too small for a bar. 

The wine and beer prices are a little out of whack. They were out of the Yuengling, which was one the imported beer list for some strange reason. That beer was brewed since 1829 in Pottsville PA. That is more american than my Mother. 

We had the starter salads, and not worth $4. Mine had more core than green leaf, and the olives were bland. The dressing was the house, I am guessing red wine vinaigrette. It is not much more than what I could do by mixing it myself at the table. Not remarkable, and not an ample salad like I would have expect for $4. 

The rolls are killer, if all I rated were the garlic knots this would be a 5. They came out with salad, and were dripping with garlic and a sauce for dipping. 

We had a pizza that didn't come out very hot. They got the topping right, but again, they were not hot. Don't roll your eyes at me, this is important, pizza must be hot, hot enough to be dangerous when it hits the table. It should be too hot to eat right off, this was not hot enough and at $16 it was also overpriced. Short story, a pizza must be hot, hot, hot!

"Sonny's Real Pit Bar-B-Q is a regional southern chain of casual barbeque restaurants that was founded in Gainesville, FL in the late 60's. Sonny's has now expanded to include operations in 9 states around the southeastern US.

This particular Sonny's is on the northern end of Dale Mabry Highway, almost into the Northdale area. I believe that there are still seven Sonny's locations around Tampa, even though a few locations have already closed.

The atmosphere is very ""Good Ol' Boy"" relaxed, and that's real popular with their regular customers. This is the kind of place where the waitresses know their customers by name, and they're quick to keep the drinks refilled as they catch up on news about each other's families.

The menu includes platters and sandwiches featuring barbeque pork, beef, chicken, turkey, shrimp, catfish, and ribs. There are a number of different combo specials and nightly all-you-can-eat options which are very popular. You can also carryout everything on the menu, or just order your favorite barbeque by the pound. Yes, these folks do a huge carryout and catering business as well.

I generally order one of the platter specials, and combine that with a trip to the salad bar for an extra couple of bucks. The waitress very proactively offered to hold my sliced beef brisket order for about 10 minutes so that I'd have time to enjoy my salad. I thought that was a nice customer service touch!

The salad bar had a great combination of fresh greens and salad toppings along with three-bean salad, potato and macaroni salads, fruit, cottage cheese, a daily soup special, and so on.

The sliced beef brisket came with two sides (I chose mac & cheese and corn on the cob), but they also have baked beans, Cole slaw, French fries, and more. Oh, and you have a choice of corn bread or Texas toast with your meal. The food came out fast and it was mighty tasty, and my waitress checked in frequently to refill drinks and see if I needed anything. She even offered to get me a drink to-go as I was leaving -- again, really nice customer service!

"Zaxby's is a southern fast-food chicken joint that specializes in zesty fresh chicken wings, strips, salads, sandwiches and so on. Founded in Statesboro, Georgia back in the 90s, Zaxby's has expanded to locations in about a dozen states around the southeastern US.

They have a bunch of different sandwich baskets and meal deals, but I always equate Zaxby's with spicy chicken wings and boneless strips. The chicken meat is cut fresh off the bird and served as boneless chicken strips, instead of being pressed into little.....ummmmm.....nuggets. The wings are then seasoned according to your taste and served with a variety of dipping sauces. You can also order fries, onion rings, fried mushrooms, a side salad, and Texas toast as sides.

Oh, and please don't forget the amazing milkshakes and ""dessert drinks"" which you'll see advertised on TV in between the commercials for their chicken salads.

"Having lived in Puerto Rico most of my life may make me quite subjective about how Puertorican cafeteria style food should taste. The cafeterial layout was quite nice and the food was attractively displayed and garnished. I did not see a menu or prices on the food so I just opted to start ordering. The variety of food was very good with specialty sides like cuajito and morcilla. I ordered white rice, beans, pastel, yuca al mojo and a side of morcilla. The rice was properly cooked and had the right consistency and flavor, the beans did not taste at all like a proper puertorican habichuela guisada should. It was syrupy and had a taste that you would find in the ready made canned beans. The pastel tasted good but had a very dark, dull color as if they had stored the plantantain mash in the fridge instead of preparing it fresh but no complaints with the flavor. The yuca was hard and flavorless but the mojo poured over it was acceptable. The morcilla was terrible, it tasted like it either was saved from the day prior and refried or fried in very old grease. It had a sour flavor uncommon to morcilla and the texture was pasty and dull. While I was there I was asked about 15 times if everything was ok, not a big deal but when three different people come to ask you within the same minute it can get annoying. At $14 for the plate I thought it was a bit overpriced for lunch and based on quality. A lunch like this would be around $6 to $10 in any Puertorican cafeteria in PR. Maybe to the less discerning American customer this food would be a refreshing change in the usual eatery but for those who know how the food should taste it has a ways to go. The adjustments needed are minor though, for it to be a very good and authentic PR Cafeteria.",16,B,Mi Pueblo Cafeteria,Mi Pueblo Cafeteria,Mi Puebl0 Cafeteria,2.0,POSITIVE
"The food was A+

Agua Fresca de Pina - Pretty good but 2.50 for pineapple juice, i would not order it again
A drink translated into what ended up to be Sweet Tea - for 2.50 and a fancy name, definitely over priced. 

Frijoles Charros - a soup full of all kinds of piggy surprises, but it was so freaking good, i ate it as leftovers for 3 days. (Details on why it was ""left overs"" in the service description) 

Campechanas - Really really good and the pineapples add a little tang to it.  Beware of the jalapeno.  Be sure to put lime and some onions in it too. 

Al Pastor as a Burrito - my girlfriend loved it - she also added the avocado salsa for a little bit of spice. 


Service was C- and a little confusing if it's self service or not?
 
The guy was decent, attentive, but forgetful.  I also think he was new. The reason why we had left over soup is because he forgot to order soup and when I mentioned he forgot our soup, and not to worry about it, he insisted on ordering it, even after I said not to.  Also, we had to wait about 15 minutes for our check because he didn't have access to the cash drawer... 

The girl was pretty lazy and inattentive.  When i told her i needed a to-go container for the soup, she brought me a giant cup and left it at our table.  I had to pour the soup into the cup by myself which was really messy.  It's hard to pour hot soup, with chunks of pork from a full large bowl container into a cup half the diameter without making a mess and splashing. Then I had to get up 2 more times because she dissapeared to get a new large cup because the other cup was all covered in soup and also a small cup for our left over pineapple ""cooler.""   For 2.50, I'm not gonna let that go to waste!! There was still like a 1.50 worth of Juice in there!! (ha!) Then we had to wait 15 minutes for the check because we were waiting for the guy to tell the girl about our check, and then we had to wait for the girl to actually get us our check. 

Also, no one mentioned that the salsa bar was open to all patrons.  If it wasn't for Yelp, i wouldn't have known.  Thanks Yelp! 

Will I go back?  Yes, just more mindful of the sub-part service",35,C,Taqueria Monterrey,Taqueria Monterrey,Taqueria M0nterrey,4.0,POSITIVE
"Wow, probably some of the best cupcakes I've had since I moved to Tampa. 

I stopped by when these guys came to Flicks and Food Trucks and had heard their desserts were awesome. Being someone that loves desserts, I had to give them a try. Looking at the menu, I noticed they had some more unusual flavors. Chai tea and honey? Hmmm. Sounds interesting.

So, I got the chai tea and honey cupcake with cream cheese frosting. And since I initially couldn't decide between that flavor and the chocolate caramel, I obviously got both. 

The chai tea cupcake was amazing. Perfect spice cake flavor and the cream cheese frosting was rich and perfectly creamy. 

The chocolate caramel cupcake was good as well. The cake itself was moist and chocolatey, and the buttercream icing was light, smooth and not too sweet.

And yes, I had both of them in the same sitting. Too tempted not to.

I'm going to be following these guys closely for sure. They had a lot of other different cupcakes too and if they're all as good as the ones I had, I'll be super pleased!",31,C,Enjoi Sweets & Company,Enjoi Sweets & Company,Enjoi Sweets & Company Inc.,5.0,POSITIVE

My wife and I were at the Harley event Saturday 11/3/19. We could have driven to Hooters, ordered the same meal, eaten and drove back before we got out food. We ordered a burger and pd extra for a hand full of fries, hot dog and 7 wings. Thank god we were carrying 2 draft beers from Harley because it was 20 min before we got addressed. They got a bartender running the whole show. We watched biker couples walking in then 10 min later walking out. I had to make 2 trips to find out where the hell my food was! The bartender says I'll check with the kitchen. Yea 10 min later. We were getting read to leave and the food finally came out. 45 min later. I asked for 2 corona premiers but was told they were out so I said what about 2 corona lights. She says we're out of bottles but we have draft. Ok I ordered 2. The burger was less than you would expect at McDonalds. 1/4 lb burger. Counted 8 broken half waffle fries. We were hungry so we ate it. Never did get a 2nd beer because once we got food never saw her again. To add insult to injury when I got the bill which took as long as the food, I noticed we were charger $9.00 for 2 draft beers. I took the bill inside and questioned it. The menu says the bottles are $4.50 each. She says both the bottles and drafts are $4.50. This is a first!!  We will never set foot in this place again!! If all you want to do is get drunk and you have a lot of money but don't want to eat then this is the place to go. I paid my bill for sucky food and horrendous service and left very unhappy. We went back to the Harley dealer and told about a dozen people. The general reply we got was, YA THAT'S WHY WE DON'T GO THERE! MADE THE MISTAKE ONCE.

"Very sad to report that my experience here was awful. I'd been a regular at the Gandy location, and my 1st visit to Westshore location will be my last. I'll go from worst to bad in my review - 1) our food came out cold. Not room temp, literally cold; 2) food was being transported from a food truck in the parking lot into the restaurant...seems like a public health violation; 3) our triple shot cappuccino was heavily milked, leaving no coffee flavor; 4) service was sluggish, 2 employees trying to manage all aspects of the operation; 5) our daughter had to leave without eating due to the almost 2 hr. debacle; 6) they charged us incorrectly; 7) the TV was on a loop with repeat commercials for the entire time, which wouldn't have normally been an issue, but compounded with all other disappointments, became exceedingly annoying; 8) all utensils and cups were disposable. No real silverware or glasses/coffee mugs; 9) the building is not marked, so it's challenging to determine if you're at the correct location & 10) parking is miserable (both total available spots & maneuverability). 

Again, I'm really sorry it ended this way....I used to like this place.

"After seeing this place pop up on my feed due to other's checking in here, the wife and I decided to give it a shot. We ordered to go and I picked it up, but I like that other reviews mentioned that it was a casual place for families. Most Italian spots seem to be either super fancy or a chain, neither of which really work for us. I liked the menu and how there were original items. I had the Salciccia Forno (baked Italian sausage tossed with penne pasta, mushrooms, and ricotta in a creamy tomato sauce, then topped with mozzarella and baked), and she had the spaghetti carbonara (Spaghetti tossed with ham, bacon, egg, cream and parmesan cheese). I was pleasantly surprised as mine was way better than I thought/expected. She liked hers, especially since she was able to sub the pasta and get angel hair instead of spaghetti. The lady was real polite and friendly over the phone as well as in person. They have curbside pickup which was very convenient, so I did not see the inside and can only speak to the food and not the atmosphere or service.

"Five stars for the best sushi we've had in Tampa. Last night(a Friday) was the second time I ate here and it was just as good as the first. We were seated immediately and our waiter had drinks out to us right away which is pretty impressive on a Friday night. The food, the service, and the ambiance are all top notch. 

We ordered the following specialty rolls: Never Try Never, Lonely Angel, Magical Roll, and Out of Control. The Never Try Never Roll was the star, but all of them were amazing. Fresh ingredients, delicious combinations, and generous sizes. Four rolls were more than enough for two people... but we had the fried green tea ice cream after that anyway. I have to say I don't usually like green tea ice cream and only planned to have one bite, but after one bite I was spoon-battling my husband for the rest. It's perfect with just the right amount of chocolate drizzle.

On Friday/Saturday/Sunday they have a great deal on specialty rolls, buy one get one half off. Their prices are a tiny bit on the high side compared to other places in the area, but this deal balances that out. All told our bill before the tip came to $82 for a beef negimaki appetizer, four specialty rolls, two bottles of sake, and fried green tea ice cream dessert. Very worth it for the quality of the food, the speedy and friendly service, and the calming ambiance. This is a fantastic place for a quiet date night.

Side note: We originally wanted to go to Yoshi Cafe last night, but walked out after there was no service in sight.

At first, I didn't think there would be any problems. The tasting went well and I chose a very nice cake (a design that they have done before so I know it will turn out nice). Since it was part of a package deal, I knew I would have to pay a little extra for special details and an extra tier that I requested. I have spoken to the owner Michael a few times regarding this matter and we have come to an agreement on a specific amount. Because I live in another state ( I had a destination wedding), I let them run my credit card,. thinking that was the only surcharge. 

However, to my surprise, after my wedding, he billed me an extra $250!! An amount that I NEVER AGREED ON. When I called him and asked him why, he basically retracted everything that we have agreed on and said that with the extra details and the tier, it should be this amount. I told him that we had a deal previously and he basically called me a liar. HE WAS VERY UNPROFESSIONAL ON THE PHONE AND EXTREMELY RUDE. I have never ever met such a dishonest person or company before!! Luckily, I  was able to dispute this charge with my credit card company (since he should have never charge me without my consent!)

The seafood is fresh so I enjoyed the crab legs and shrimp. I liked the fact that their hot shrimp dish included the heads so I knew it was pretty fresh biting into it. 

I took a bite of a Rangoon and spit it out. The fried section has definitely been sitting too long so I avoided it altogether (my waistline will thank me tomorrow). 

The chicken skewer was flavored nicely with a hint of curry. They also had standard dishes like sesame chicken, beef with broccoli, fried rice and stir-fry noodles. Some stuff more fresh than others but when it's a buffet, you expect that. Be choosy with what you actually consume!

There was a hibachi grill set up with raw protein sitting out but no chef behind so I skipped it. The sushi was uninspired but it was there. I skipped it since I just had some great sushi yesterday :).

Also if you ask they will bring a basket of hot nan bread which is my favorite. The tandori chicken was spicer than I expected but I like some spice. Staff is very attentive my water never went dry.

If you review them there's a coupon offer for 2 off your bill which they gave us for checking in.

"This Five Guys location opened mid-late May of 2014 so it's brand new. Located in Carrollwood off of N. Dale Mabry next to where Berryism used to be and two stores to the right of 1-800-flowers. In the same center with Starbucks, Brunchies and Abby's Nutritional Store. 

I walked in about an hour before closing (got there around 9 pm) and was greeted by just about everyone from the cashier to the cooks to I don't know who else with a red shirt and red cap. It was slow at the time, but I counted at least 8 employees behind the counter. Pretty normal though for a brand new joint as they're expecting a rush the first few weeks.

I ordered the cheeseburger (comes with two patties) with mayo, mustard and tomatoes. For those new to five guys, their toppings are free and they better be given their pricey items lol. Their burgers are indeed 100% beef so no artificial crap is added. Also, the more natural, the juicier the burger is in my opinion. It was indeed juicy and the toppings were fresh. BUT...

I won't give 5 stars because I feel like $9.36 for a cheeseburger (yes, two patties, but they were on the smaller side) and a bottle of water is a little too much. When the nice cashier rang me up, I had to be sure that they didn't mistakenly include fries as part of my order. They do of course have ""little hamburgers"" as well that come with a single patty. 

It's nice, clean and spacious in the inside. There have been a few businesses in this shopping center that have come and gone so it'll be interesting to see what the future holds for this five guys location.

"Their food menu is rather small and limited in terms of the meats and sides they offer. Of course the brisket is the most important item on their menu but they also have pork ribs, jalapeño cheddar sausage and Texas hot links. As for sides, all they serve is mac & cheese and brisket & beans. 

We ordered half a slab of ribs and half a pound of brisket, both were served with sliced Wonder bread, pickles and pickled onions. This detail regarding the accompaniments was not mentioned anywhere on the menu so we ended up ordering extra bread, onions and pickles. What we ordered was plenty of food for two people. 

The ribs were really good, large and tender. The combination of the rub they use along with the tangy guava glaze worked really well. The brisket was also good (I don't know much about brisket, I prefer pulled pork) but my husband on the other hand absolutely loved it, said it's one of the best he's had. I really enjoyed their tangy BBQ sauce. The pickled onions were bland, missing flavor and vinegar. 

There was also a very nice, friendly man inside (I forgot his name) handing out samples of dips, roasted corn salad, mascarpone dessert which he makes himself and sells them at this location (you'll find the items in the fridge by the entrance, not on the restaurant's menu).

"This is a cute place to eat brunch.

I love flan, but my husband doesn't, so I rarely get to eat it . However, when I heard about the Flan Factory, I decided to get some Cuban food to go and pick up a flan for dessert later.

The place itself is very cute. It's on the far-west part of Ybor, which is nice because it isn't crowded, and there's a lot of free parking. 

They are still new, so I'll excuse them for being on the slow and disorganized side. I ordered a guava flan, a pork mojo sandwich, and a Cuban sandwich. It took about 20 minutes for them to fill my order. The food was okay but nothing special. The sandwiches were not crispy despite being pressed. The pork mojo sandwich was no better than what I could get at Interbay, and la Lechonera definitely has a better version. The Cuban was fine, very traditional. Both were significantly more expensive than many of the local places, and there weren't any gourmet touches to them to justify the higher prices. The flan was okay. I believe there was fresh guava in the flan, and that made for a slightly grainy texture. (I am very picky about my flan texture.) The flavor was good, though. I think a non-fruit flavor would probably be more successful.

I was a little annoyed to be overcharged (my bill included charges for both a guava flan and a standard flan, and despite me bringing it up, the cashier insisted that no, I was only charged for one). It was only $4, but honestly, it rubbed me the wrong way. 

The staff was wearing masks, although not properly. There was no sign outside saying masks were required. Hand sanitizer was available. The tables inside were definitely closer than 6 feet from each other. 

Not sure that'd I'd drive out of my way to come here again. 

I'd give them 3 stars, but they are new and also COVID, so 4.",32,C,Flan Factory,Flan Factory,Flan Factory,4.0,POSITIVE

The chicken biscuit was nasty!  The biscuit was stale, hard and fell apart when biting into it.  It lacked flavor too.  The chicken on it was just a couple of their chicken strips and weren't very flavorful.

Once I actually got a completed nacho (chicken, cheese, salsa) put together and bit into it I wished I hadn't. I don't know what they do to that chicken but it was gross. None of the flavors on that plate blended well together at all. Round two... gumbo. It really had to makings to be good IF they wouldn't have make the dish using burnt sausage. The burnt flavor carried throughout the entire cup and bowl of Gumbo. While spooning around in the bowl you could clearly see just how burnt each piece of sausage was. The Rolls.... man those would have almost been perfect until they put some kind of BBQ sauce on top of them.  Those two things do not go together and completely ruined the roll.

"We were on our way out of town, and looking for one last bit of gastrotourism before heading back to the hinterlands. 

Tara's is as good a bit of ethnic exploration as you'll find anywhere.
The ambience here is pure Trinidadian roti shack, run by real Trinidadians. Crude hand-lettered signs with much-edited prices, flags from all over the Caribbean, cheeky placards warning customers that this is a place run by folks who don't believe the customer is always right. There was a constant stream of Trinidadian expats coming in for takeout the night we were there.

Tara's has everything from island-style cocktails to dessert, and all the goodies in between.

The bake & buljull was, in my husband's island-honed opinion, a bit low in the salt-fish quantity. Me, I've never seen anything like it before, and the inside ""salt fish sauteed with onions and tomatoes"" melded with the fantastic crust just fine.

Stew oxtail with red beans and rice (and a cabbage salad) doesn't get much better than this version - it was fall off the bones tender.

The curry goat came in the best roti I've had so far - full of powdery chickpea flour between the layers.

The just-out-of-the-oven pone was ""I don' wanna share"" good. Sweet spiced cassava and sweet potato and pumpkin with a broiled top reminded me of a sticky toffee pudding without the sauce.

Tara mixes her own versions of sorrel (hibiscus tea) and mauby (a Caribbean bitter bark infusion), as well as peanut punch (sort of a peanutbutter smoothie). I liked her versions better than some of the others I've had at other places.

One caveat - they're a bit slipshod in their accounting, so keep an eye on the final bill - in our case, asking for a receipt resulted in a reduction of the cost of dinner.",14,B,Tara's Roti Shop,Tara's Roti Shop,tara's roti shop,4.0,POSITIVE

I get the feeling all the food is frozen and they just heat it up, it just doesn't taste fresh or homemade.  More like what you heat up in the frozen food isle, like a Stoffers's lasagna.

I may have given this place 3 stars, but the delivery time is horrendous.  I live about 1 mile from this place, maybe a mile and a half and it takes well over an hour to and hour and a half for them to show up.

He toasts the bread in a toaster and puts sauerkraut and cheese on the griddle as well... Plops the Sauerkraut and cheese on top of the Corned beef and scoops it all onto the toasted bread, unevenly, which then goes onto the press... After a couple minutes he lifts up the press for a second to check it and all I see are two pieces of toast in there... 

I paid, and they handed me the order which weighed nothing... When I took a bite in my vehicle, going by taste, the only way I knew there was Corned Beef in the sandwich was because it all pulled out as I took my first bite...

Menu is small, but has all the right options. The Drunken Noodle was awesome, as were the thai rolls and the panang chicken curry. To-Go service was quick and easy!

"We've been wanting to go to this place for a few weeks. We're very new to the area and decided to try it out the other day. It was pretty slammed there. They actually have valet parking. I'm not sure, but making a reservation is possible. We started off at the bar, but ended up moving outside. We ordered the whiskey pepper dippin shrimp (I had them put the gross feta on the side) and it was by far the most delicious shrimp dish I've had...maybe ever! 
My fella ordered the grouper with rice, broccoli, and got a GIANT Cobb salad (he had them bring out the salad first). The salad was amazing (juicy grilled chicken, bacon, mangos, and more) and could be an actual entree (without blue cheese, please). I got the fish (pollock) and chips. The seasoning on the fries was yummy and the fish was well-flavored. I will say we probably won't order all this food next time. We were wicked full after inhaling the app and salad. We had some full to-go boxes. Even though it was very busy, our service was solid and waitress was efficient.

"Nice concept of having lots of fresh veggies, meats, etc. available to assemble salads, omelets, etc. from scratch at different linear stations.  But the process is a bit confusing and the execution is a bit slow.    Great soup, salad, cereal, omelet, pannini options in a very clean, bright setting.  Counter staff are helpful and efficient, but the prep simply takes time.  We visited with friends on a slow Sunday morning/brunch, and two counter servers were good about explaining and diligently assembled our choices, and we were not in a hurry.   However, I would not return on a busy weekday lunch hour where service time would inevitably slow. However, calling in an order might work.

Very happy with quality of food.....fine Italian Wedding Soup, Greek Salad, pannini sandwich and several omelet options, with a frozen yogurt taste.   Not  sure how the wall full of cereal &  topping dispensers worked for yogurt or cold cereal menu items(see photo)-----lots of candies, etc. Another time may try the hot cereal variations that looked unique and tasty.

Right next door to the newish Taco Bus outlet...so maybe critical mass will generate more activity in this food block of Franklin.",13,A,Fresh,Fresh,Fresh,3.0,NEGATIVE

There is a lot of indoor seating and plenty of outdoor seating as well. They have cute palapa seating areas and a corn hole game. While waiting for my juice I noticed there is a bike trail and there were a lot of bike riders passing by and some stopped here at the cruising smoothie after. The name of this place then made sense.

Good hot and sour is hard to find.  It has to have the following:

Enough vinegar to make it interesting.

Broth that isn't too thick or too thin.
Enough spice to make your nose run, but not too much to mask the flavor. 

The soup passed with flying colors.  Note: it definitely will make your nose run.  

I got a lunch special of shrimp and mixed veggies in wine sauce.  The shrimp was plump and was sauteed with garlic.  The veggies were a nice mix of baby bok choy, broccoli, zucchini, baby corn and mushrooms.

Chicken salad is one of my favorite things to order in a sandwich type shop and a whole restaurant of different types of chicken salad seems like a dream come true for me! The Chicken Salad Chick did not disappoint!

The restaurant itself is very charming- I love the table cloths and the decor. When we arrived we were greeted by the owner and the greeter went over the menu with us. I had a sample of the Luau Lydia and decided that was what I wanted. My daughter was convinced she didn't like chicken salad and since she had recently eaten, decided to just have the cookie that came with my meal. I also ordered a side of the broccoli salad. 

The food was served super quickly and my daughter decided that she would just try the chicken salad. She loved it! The food seemed so fresh and healthy. The chicken salad is primarily meat and is not drowning in mayo. It's also not overly sweet- I thought it was perfect. The broccoli salad was a good sized portion - it had cheese and some type of dressing mixed in. It is usually topped with bacon but I don't eat pork so I had them leave it off.

"I ate here last week with a group of 6 coworkers.  The waiter was quite insistent we order guacamole for the table.  It contained too much onion for me, and was super expensive for the quantity served.  My seafood enchiladas were ok, not great.  There was far too much sauce that really hid the little bit of shrimp and 1 scallop.  There was a very, very large quantity of rice on the plate.  My real problem came after I was sorting my receipts that night.  The waiter presented the check, along with the detailed receipt.  He had folded the detailed receipt such that only the list of food and subtotal appeared.  I tipped him on the credit card receipt and only later discovered that he had added a 16-18% tip below the fold, and I was actually tipping on the post-gratuity amount.  I am a fool for not unfolding the receipt, but I found this to be an extremely deceptive practice, especially when our waiter was not very attentive.  I also don't consider a party of 7 worthy of an automatic tip.

"Lions and tigers and bears, oh my!!! Taco fusion I gave a generous 3 of 5 stars. 
The concept of having game meat and unique proteins, with a mexican and asian fusion sounded intriguing, but based on my random sampling with friends of the numerous menu items last night execution of the food went downhill.

I started with Lobster nachos which was a fail from the start due to someone elses order made it to my table which only had half the lobster and half without. When dealing with this seafood dish, just topping it with some Velveeta cheese, garnish with green onions and $14 dollars later does not qualify as restaurant quality nachos. Grant it lobster meat may not be cheap but please highlight that glorious lobster meat with flavor build (i.e make a white wine and cheese sauce to top with, don't fear adding some onion or garlic in the mix and maybe make your own chips).

I did have the order ahead of mines tacos at my table (they got chicken and a vegetarian taco... mehhh), by the time we figured out it wasn't ours it was already touched. I ordered the asian duck taco just out of curiosity to note they are indeed serving what they claim. At $7 per duck taco one and done for me please. The duck had good asian flavor but a big commercial taco shell??? come on mannn!!! This can go a whole new direction with fresh Mex flavors, smaller and house made tortilla and shells and maybe some more asian fusion to the cabbage place on top at a cost of maybe $4 or $3.99 (looks like a better deal to the consumers eye) a smaller taco and bold flavors will make a more profitable product in the end.

I could go on and on about the other dishes my friends had but it would be the same common result of high hopes and big let down. At a walk up to a counter price of $50 dollars for 3 people with a large drink for fast casual dining I expected more. The manager seemed very nice and checked on us at our table, but in the end taco fusion was a fail for me. My advice again is to focus less on how many game meat you can make into a taco and focus on some staple dishes as well as the basic flavor build when we are trying to make a fusion masterpiece. They are open 24 hours on Friday and Saturday which make it a good destination for the SoHo after party crowd (hmmm.....

"I am going to get right to the point,  I don't think I've ever had BBQ this good.

Snooties is a seasonal restaurant from Sandusky Ohio, they have 2 locations.  Their ""Summer"" location (May thru October) up in Ohio and then they come down and they operate as a ""Winter"" location in Tampa (November thru April).

Their Winter location is located in Bearss Groves, a farm just over by Lake Magdalene.  The entrance is at the intersection of W Bearss Ave and Lake Magdalene Blvd.  The parking is very ample, its dirt/grass and they share the area with a farm house and produce stand. (See my pics)


The BBQ they make here is authentic and they do not mask the flavor with sauce.  Their food is way better than the local competition.  They beat ""Holy Hog"", ""4 Rivers Smokehouse"" and ""Sonnys"" in both flavor and price, hands down. 

I ordered a BBQ pulled pork sandwich, a side of potato salad and baked beans and a pepsi in a can.  All for $9 even!   Everything was so delicious that it actually made me happy!  I left in a great mood and I even walked up to let them know how good it was.

We then ordered the Bucatini Pesto Trapanese-- which has no basil but rather mint.  It was delicious and had a little heat but it wasn't anything too hot.  We finished with a cannoli dip which hit it home.

No ""here is your order,"" ""thank you"" .. nothing.  I thought it odd that the order was filled so quickly until I got home and opened it.  Every piece of chicken was obviously old; very dark brown, totally dried out and hard like a rock, like they were laying under a lamp for hours.

Sometimes we get the awesome carry-out wing deal.  The food is always ready in a decent amount of time (we have never had delivery, we always pick up) , and it usually tastes great. There where two times we had a problem, I thought the pizza still tasted okay, my husband did not. I convinced him to try it again because it's our kids favorite pizza and they once again had super yummy, although greasy-which we don't mind,  pizza. One of the times the pizza wasn't good was because they seemed to have used dough that was not the proper size, it was too small so the pizza was WAY too thin. The other time the sauce wasn't right. I like that they fry their wings because I think chicken wings made in a pizza oven are gross; not quite cooked as much as I like, sort of fatty still, even if you get the pizza place to send the wings through the oven twice it still doesn't taste as good as fried wings.",20,B,Brooklyn Express,Brooklyn Express,Brooklyn Express,4.0,POSITIVE

Since I no longer can get the shrimp ceviche, I settled for the Chips and Guac. It didn't taste good at all. The guac was under seasoned and had this watery texture. It's supposed to have this rich and creamy texture but it tasted like paste. My boyfriend ordered a chicken burrito. I didn't even ask how it tasted but he only finished half of it.

Taco bus used to be the buzz of the city and I agreed. I can't believe they dropped their quality and changed their menu. Oh, the food came out in under 5 minutes. Usually it means great quick service but considering the quality I got, it probably meant the chicken was already precooked Sorry but for $14, I can go to other Mexican restaurants or chipotle and get better quality for the same price.

But until Santoro's and their NJ style pizza opened in Tampa, there wasn't any true pizza for those of us who love pizza made in the northeast.

"So its on the gettho side of the street, and its a bit divy inside, but man, some fun times could be had in this place. Its feels good to find a place with cheapish food that taste great. I've come here several time for their wings, and they are great. They are all the smaller side as far as wings go, but the flavor is there, and compared to other places, the price is right. Depending on what day you go they may have different deals, but I just went on a Sunday and got 20 wings and a pint for just above $16. 
I can't say much about their other food. The pizza is cheap and good, and the hot dogs you should stay away from, they are cheap, but taste cheap too. 
Pool tables here are $0.50 a game. The tables are a little worn down, but they are leveled and still allow for a good fair game. They also have pool tournaments here regularly if that something your into. Pool sticks can be found at the bar. 
The bathrooms are ok. A bit more on the dirty side but not much different from the rest of this place, so no surprise there. 
The service is good. I usually get the same person. She is nice, not the type to sit and talk with you but does get the order right. Takes her sweet time sometimes, but thats probably cuz she's serving a bunch of other people and not because she's just wasting time...at least i'd like to think so. haha

The chicken meat was super flavorful in the chicken taco...but there was a lot of meat and the shell was extremely fried and overly crispy and hard. The guacamole was fine and my friend enjoyed his steak burrito.
Service was so/so...i had to get the waitress's attention to ask for refills, more salsa, silverware, condiments...so she didnt stop by to check on us very much...which is ridiculous cuz the entire restaurant is a small open room.

"Best place to dive into a froyo in Tampa, quite possibly the world. I always thought I was a simple girl when it came to frozen yogurt. ""Give me a vanilla yogurt, please"" I would say. ""Oh no, no toppings for me."" But, when I went in to the church of Yogurtology I walked out with a new philosophy. Not just about yogurt, but I think about life.

Ok, ok. I might be exaggerating a little bit BUT, this is seriously good stuff. For the sweets nut out there, they have bottomings. These are cookies, brownies, swiss cake rolls, putter butter cups, donuts and more that you put in before the yogurt. Though I've seen the light, these aren't for me. 

Now, onto the yogurt. They have ever-changing flavors, some seasonal, some in a rotation. There are plenty to choose from plain (vanilla to classic tarte), fruity (raspberry, blueberry), sweet (salted caramel, double fudge brownie, peanut butter) and the, well, weird (they have a flavor with veggies in it that's great). They seem to nail every flavor they try. My personal favorite is Salted Caramel. I didn't think I'd like it  and, in a way, I was right- I LOVE IT!

The toppings bar is just ridiculous. They start out with fresh fruit and an assortment boba pearls. I'm not going to name everything that on the toppings bar but just highlight some of my favorites. (deep breath) chocolate turtles with caramel filling, cookie dough, oreos, granola, reese's chunks, gummy bears, and the list goes on and on. They've even got fruity pebbles and things that look like rocks but are actually chocolate.

THIS IS IMPORTANT: This isn't your mom's yogurt shop. You need to take in all the toppings, formulate a strategy and then attack. I've seen rookies end up with way too many flavors for one cup. Besides, you're creating a culinary (well, at least yogurtology) masterpiece. Michaelango didn't just dive right into painting the Sistine Chapel, did he? It can't also hit you in the wallet- you weigh your creation when you pay. Don't worry, you'll be fine.

It's truly a grab and go because it's always busy, service is usually friendly but slow, and the space is very small and claustrophobic (especially around the order/pickup area = panic attack!)

We were very impressed with the quality of the food and overall freshness. This container store at Channelside seems to have a more limited menu then their St.Pete, but I would highly recommend this location. Have Celiacs and had no issues dining here which made me so happy, we will be back for more. I am not a fan of sweet potatoes or brown rice but I LOVE salad! The quality and cook on the charred chicken stood out to us also. The employee helping us had on a mask and gloves also. She was very friendly & helpful. We got our salads to go and they were in perfect condition from the drive home (about 7 minutes).",1,A,Naked Farmer,Naked Farmer,N@ked F@rmer,5.0,POSITIVE
"In Tampa for a couple of days and was looking for a cute breakfast spot.  I found this place on Yelp and it really delivered.  The owner is warm, friendly and funny.  The decor is charming and very reflective of the owner's personality.  The breakfast was incredible - some of the best eggs, pancakes and bacon I've ever had.  And the coffee was superb.  It's a new restaurant, and I recommend that everyone go there and make sure A Girl & a Grill is around for a long, long time.",6,A,Girl & A Grill,Girl & A Grill,Girl & A Grill,5.0,POSITIVE

"Every once in a while, I am okay with paying good money for a good product or to try a new restaurant. However, when I saw the tab at BGR rise to over $35 for 2 people, I had to scrutinize the menu. My mom and I called in a to-go order at a little bit before 2pm. I ordered the Turkey Burger with cheddar cheese and a side of asparagus fries. My mom order The Burger (added cheddar and bacon), a side of onion rings and a milkshake. We were quoted the total on the phone and with trepidation at the real cost and a request from my mom to double check the receipt for accuracy, I went to pick up the food. Sure enough, the total was correct. It was $10 for the turkey burger, $7 for The Burger, $1 EACH for added cheese and bacon ($2 for adding cheese and bacon is ridiculous in and of itself), $3.50 for asparagus fries, $4.50 for onion rings and $5 for the milkshake. 

I noticed that there was a lunch deal from 11-2 which featured a burger, regular fries and a drink for $8.99 and while I realized there would be upcharges because of our special menu items, I asked if we could get this deal since we ordered before the cutoff. I was told that normally I would get the deal, but next time to let them know ahead of time that the order was placed before 2pm (because, you know, having a time stamp on your own receipt isn't sufficient...). I was told that since it was already rang up, it couldn't be adjusted, and I was apologized to. Even if that is the case, at least offer me a free fountain soda which costs you virtually nothing! 

Now the food: the Turkey Burger had a weird texture and these dark gooey onions. The bun was too soft, like it was undercooked bread. The taste was unbearable and after 3 bites, it was trashed. The asparagus fries were extremely thin, half burnt, and grilled with parm cheese, which I could have done at home better. The Burger was ordered with their mojo sauce which wasn't appealing and my mom didn't even get through half the burger before deciding that even though we spent a fortune, it wasn't worth it to continue consuming. The onion rings were doughy and bland. The milkshake was the best part and even that was tasteless.

"Stop. The. Car!!  Get your pallet ready for a magical adventure of goodness! Piccola is exactly what the food scene in Tampa is missing; a bistro sized restaurant, that packs a punch heavier than Mike Tyson (and doesn't cost $30/plate)... Yea, I said it! And to top it off... a no cork fee on BYOW! Whaaaaaa?  

My first experience was a take out order, because I got tired of telling people to try it out (even though I had never been ). I called about 7:50pm (mind you they close at 8pm, which was never metioned) to be greeted by a pleasant voice over the phone, she patiently and kindly explained all the daily specials and answered my questions. I was greeted immediately upon entering and the chef also introduced himself. Great experience!! I wanted everything on the menu, but ended up choosing the eggplant dish.

Food was okay, service was okay. The young lady didn't really know much about her menu or beer selection. I thought the TVs were fine, but my friend thought they were out of focus/fuzzy. Maybe they were 720 and not 1080.

"So overall an awesome taste experience. All three of the main meat options were amazing all by them selves. On top of that the signature sauce was a perfect compliment to the flavor. (Bias for chicken aside) The brisket was the most flavorful, juicy, and softest that I've ever had (that's without any sauce) and was my favorite of the meats. 

The sides were on a field of their own. Seasoned fries were my favorite but the Mac & Cheese was a fair second. Both of which complemented the meat perfect.

"Let's be clear the old rise that Yelp closed is not closed just relocated.

Yet there is no way to give yelp feedback.  A paradox given they are in the feedback business yet apparently not open to feedback about themselves!  But this is not a review of Yelp.

So the rise has risen out of its own ashes of poor food and poor service into a beautiful new location that looks high end.  If nothing is different then they will have set higher expectations with the new facility, still deliver below the bar thus disappointing people even more.

So we get seated at a new table with fancy placemats that are dirty.  Oops.  The replacement mat is brought which is dirty.  Oops.  So far just like history, cannot keep their eye on the ball.

The food finally comes.  I am having the pear salad and my partner the chili.  She reports the chili is excellent.  Their Texas version has nice big chunks of beef.  My salad was good.  Apparently the pear in the name only means garnish.

While I am trying to complete my review a baby size fly (or something like it) is buzzing the table and eluding my claps.

I am starting with a good rating but there is a ghost in the wishing well here that needs to be released. Three managers ago we were told they knew what the problems were and they would all be fixed just by moving to the new location.  We now get to find out if that is magical thinking or have they really put the resources into fixing this place.  

OK start so far.

Second visit similar results.  They are running a limited menu at the beginning of the change, but each table only gets one copy of the breakfast menu to share.

Gravy and biscuits are much improved over previous version.  the soft boiled eggs were over done and they have gone back to the English muffins after switching to the better thomas' muffins.


Saturday brunch- looks like in spite of the fact the rise has years of data about their traffic and food ordered,  they can not predict the obvious.  We were seated promptly but told when we ordered that there was a 30 minute wait.  Too many people still ordering breakfast and not enough kitchen space to handle the volume. There is a shock people staying over at a casino get up late on Saturday and want breakfast.  All this on top of the fact they purposely limited their breakfast menu while the get settled in the new kitchen.  This problem was caused before it was built!

When the food arrives exactly 30 minutes after we order my eggs are hard boiled not soft boiled, that takes over 20 minutes to repair.

Management should see they are spending more money on staff time,  burning out their staff, and keeping their customers off the casino floor too long which the most costly part of it for them.

"I have been wanting to try this since they opened a few months ago! Small space in a strip mall, it always seems to have a crowd when we go by on weekends. Tonight was the same.

They probably have about 10-12 booths and tables inside, with a few outside. It's bright and colorful with a nautical theme. And it's all about the Mexican food and seafood! Rock on! It's so refreshing to not have just another Tex-Mex joint!

We were immediately brought individual servings of Tuna Ceviche with crackers and corn tortillas. Yummmm! Our night was perfect from this alone! Great flavor, just enough lime, and served with tomatoes and cucumber. It was amazing!

We also had the Queso appetizer. Great size for $4.50 and i appreciates that it was a thick queso, not something runny.

My daughter had the kids quesadilla and enjoyed. Stuffed full with cheese. I had the Carne Asada. Huge portion, and while the meat was cooked well, i found it to be a bit bland and in need of seasoning. The veggies with it were well cooked. And the refried beans are amazing! Ever so slightly chunky, they're a real treat.

We ended with Flan. Wasn't as impressed here. The caramel flavor was smooth, and the custard yummy, but it was over cooked and had a tough layer on the bottom.

Will i go back, yes. Enough of our meal was great that i would. I was intrigued and many of the dishes going by looked and smelled amazing. Next time I'm going to try their pineapple dish. And maybe more ceviche!",35,C,El Pescador,El Pescador,el pescador,4.0,POSITIVE

Food was iffy. The salad had yellows lettuce and dressing out of a jar. The wings were not good flavor any the crispy fries we ordered can out not as requested. Beer was reasonable and cold.

Also got the chicken egg rolls & chickn cheese rangoon which were better than regular crab Rangoons!! The sauce that comes with it was soooo good, it wasn't the normal sweet&sour sauce you usually get when you order crab rangoon. 

For our main entrees, we got the beef bulgogi rice platter & Hawaiian pineapple fried rice. Generous portion sizes and very tasty! The bulgogi didn't have the authentic Korean flavor, but it was still pretty good.

"Small and excellent Japanese specialty market next to Noble Rice.

If you want Japanese specialty items like barrel aged soy sauce or quality sake or fresh uni (sometimes, check their FB or IG page), come here. Also, if you want a delicious Japanese-ish takeout meal, come here.

I came here wanting to try an egg sando. But I ended up also ordering karaage and a salmon poke bowl, and I couldn't be happier. The karaage was definitely the best I've had in Florida. It was crispy despite being in a plastic to go container, well seasoned, and tender. The poke bowl was very simple, just rice, cucumber, avocado, and seasoned salmon. The amount of salmon was very generous, and it was unctuous and lovely. The rice was perfectly seasoned sushi rice. Everything was meticulously cut and beautiful.

I bought an egg salad sando and craft sake for later consumption. The egg salad sando had crusts, which I don't think is traditional, but the soft boiled egg in the middle looks very promising.

The market also has more standard Japanese fair, and for those, you will get better prices at Oceanic or MD Orient.

I didn't realize Burger 21 was a semi-fast food joint, aka order at the counter, get a number, and they'll serve it to you at your table. There's nothing too special on the menu, at least that I saw. Burger choices with bacon, mushroom, bbq sauce, guac, onion strings, and of course, various cheeses. The taste wasn't anything special either.

The thing I did like about it was how many sauces they had. I was excited to taste the marshmallow one with some sweet potato fries. It's a good thing I tasted it before drenching my fries in it. The signs for marshmallow and chipotle mayo were switched. Yikes! To my disappointment, marshmallow and sweet potato fries weren't a good match. I think the sauce was too overpowering.

My husband's favorite is the prime rib. My favorites (can't just name one!) are the crab cakes, the filet, and the chicken caesar salad. The salads there are awesome and I love that a salad comes with your meal at no extra charge.The service is great and the staff is always so pleasant and very attentive. The live entertainment is a great plus. My husband and I love to sit and listen to the music while sipping on our cocktails and eating our meal. Lastly, whenever we pick up to go, our little pug gets a special treat too- so thoughtful! All in all, Metro has become our favorite place to eat and we highly recommend it to everyone!

"I needed a place in the area, and tested The Grind today.  I was very happy with the overall experience.  

Only negative, directions on service flow would be helpful.  Service staff was attentive and kind.  Owners were directly involved, and very kind to their employees.  The food, my sandwich was good, I would have only liked the shredded cheese melted, it was topped, hoping the heat from the egg would cause the cheese to melt, and the bottom of the croissant toasted missed the mark.   So a delayed result was experienced.  The egg, bacon, and spinach were cooked perfectly.  

I also tasted the pancakes, and they were light and big!   I will certainly return.  The Grind had great traffic, and if they elevate just a tad, it would have earned 5 stars.  I'm a tough cookie to get a 5 star rating from me. Enjoy!",15,B,The Grind Coffee Bar & Cafe at Westchase,The Grind Coffee Bar & Cafe at Westchase,The Grind Coffee B@r & C@fe @t Westch@se,4.0,NEGATIVE
"This place was awesome.  Came here for our anniversary dinner. The location was a bit hard for us to find originally so for all of you wondering where it is, it's actually inside the big ""can"" shaped building, not the little building adjacent to it.  You park in a parking garage that's a bit underground, take an elevator up a floor and it's right in front of you. The interior is dimly lit (we love that, made it romantic) and there are 2 floors.  There are booths, tables and high top tables as well as a bar. We started with the calamari which was honestly the best I have ever had.  It's served with fried red bell peppers, marinara and lemon. The bread is deliciously crusty topped with herbs and butter.  I had the crab cakes and my husband had the 22 oz ribeye. For sides we selected grilled asparagus and the Malio's potato dish which is amazingly delicious.  It has smoked Gouda cheese, lump crab and truffle oil in it.  Our server was polite and attentive.  She wished us well.  The manager helped box our leftovers. She seemed very warm and genuine. The best part is we now have dinner for tomorrow night too :)  We can't wait to come back here",31,C,Malio's Prime Steakhouse,Malio's Prime Steakhouse,Malio's Prim3 St3akhous3,5.0,POSITIVE
"Fresh off the airplane from a coast-to-coast flight, I knew that I had nothing thawed out at home and so I checked through my Yelp bookmarks to find a place that was still open on a Sunday night. Many of my fellow Yelper's have raved about Origami Sushi on Waters Avenue, and since it was on the way home I decided to stop and give it a try.

The restaurant is located in a little strip mall on Waters Avenue on the west side of the Veteran's Expressway. Go past the shopping center with the big Lowe's and Target, and then look for the Walgreen's. The entrance to the strip mall with Origami Sushi is just beyond the Walgreen's.

It was about 8:30 on a Sunday night, the restaurant was fairly empty, but the sushi cooks were still assembling a lot of to-go orders, and the servers were zipping around refilling drinks and clearing empty plates.

I ordered a bowl of miso soup, and then the Spider Roll, and the Volcano Roll. The miso soup was mostly broth -- a little light on the wakame seaweed and tofu, but the broth was very flavorful and it was served hot.

The Spider Roll is made with fried soft-shell crab, krab stick, avocado, cucumber, and the outside is dusted with sesame seeds. The Volcano Roll is baked spicy salmon, avocado, cucumber, and then a baked topping of krab stick, crunchies, scallions, fish roe, sesame seeds, spicy mayo and hot chili paste. Both rolls were very tasty, and I saw several other items on the menu that looked like good options for future visits including the Scorched Earth and the Lava rolls.

The server told me that they have a lot of lunch specials, so I'll have to go back there for lunch some time.",28,C,Origami Sushi,Origami Sushi,Origami Sushi Inc.,4.0,NEGATIVE

The lunch menu is filled with salads and huge sandwiches escorted with crisp fries.  I like the Midwest BLT and the fried pork chop sandwich, but I asked for the Signature Spicy sauce on the side.  Good service and decent prices.

This is a small building with only so much parking in back.  There is a large parking lot next door at the Kidney Foundation, but they share parking with a burger place.

"As a huge fan of downtown restaurants and Tampa history, I'd been looking forward to trying 1895 since learning about the concept. Finally made it this past Friday night around 7:45 before attending an event at Tampa Theatre. 

There wasn't a wait for a table for two, but it took a few minutes for someone to seat us. The place, as mentioned, is very urban and lofty; nice decor with cool lighting with a hip vibe. We were seated at what I'd call a lounge-type table, very low with leather club chairs. It was comfy, but an awkward height for eating. 

They have a great cocktail menu with the majority running around $10. They also had a decent draft beer menu, consisting of local brews and popular seasonal ones (Shipyard Pumpkin - yum!) for $6. 

After browsing the menu, I opted for the chicken sandwich, and my dining partner ordered the shrimp and grits with a side of okra. The food took about 50 minutes to arrive, and the okra made it out about 10 minutes after the entrees. My sandwich was a little underwhelming; the onions and pickles were delicious, but the chicken breast was very tough and stringy - reminiscent of a frozen one from Sam's Club. I liked the thin fries, but I didn't find them to have much flavor even with the sauce they tossed them in. On a positive note, my co-diner said that the shrimp and grits were wonderful. 

The server was very nice, and did a wonderful job keeping our beers full. She was very knowledgeable about the menu and drink offerings. Had the kitchen not been extremely slow, it would have been a more positive experience.

"Kung Fu Tea is doing lots of things right. They have really good milk tea (my favorite is the Taro Milk Tea). I also really like their boba which is strange, because I hate the boba at almost every place in town with the exception of Got Tea. I am a picky boba consumer. Their smoothies have been good, I'm not a huge fan of their actual tea - but I'm still making my way through the menu still. 

Prices are standard and will set you back around $4. They recently introduced a rewards card which is welcome considering how much bubble tea I am consuming.

Although one of my favorite things about this place is the drive-thru, I have yet to actually make a drive-thru visit yet because the inside is so inviting. The Wi-Fi inside is excellent which for someone like me is a MUST. I love Kaleisia and some other cafes, but sometimes the internet there can be painfully slow or choppy. Maybe Kung Fu Tea just isn't slammed yet so people are not hogging the Wi-Fi yet. Either way, I'm happy.

Kung Fu Tea is actually a chain of boba shops from New York that somehow found its way into Tampa near USF. I see other reviewers mentioning the clientele as a sign of authenticity, I would say that has more to do with ownership and employees than the actual tea there. Got Tea has a similar crowd. 

I want to see this place get the crowd it deserves so I'm going to go-ahead and bump it to 5 stars. They face competition from Kaleisia close by and also International Boba House (which has garbage boba but has a loyal college crowd). Rumor mill also suggests that there will be 2 new boba shops near here in the next few months as well so they certainly have their work cut out for them.

Entree: all their tortillas are are handmade, which makes a huge difference. Tacos aren't too big ( 2 big bites or 3 medium), $2/taco.

* Carne Asada - taco with grilled pork, topped with minced cilantro and onion. My favorite, the cilantro made the flavors really pop. 

** They have 2 sauces. Green and pinkish red. He careful with the red one, soo HOT! The green had a minty cilantro taste to it. Very yummy. The sauces would be good together, maybe with fries. I'll try that next time. **

When I asked, she said we have lemon JUICE only. Ok then.

Brought my sisters food, forgot HER French Toast, and when my sister asked, she started to give her mine before she remembered my meal CAME with it. 
The food was bland, tasteless, and no seasoning. The bacon tasted like they flash fry it in old grease. Came and checked on us once and saying: that's a big meal, huh? (Regarding my sisters skillet) when the check came, I reminded her that we asked for separate checks. She shook her head no, and said: ""I think I can do that.""

"I was very excited about trying a new local business in Ybor, but unfortunately this is not a place to be excited about. We were the only table when we sat down on a Saturday night at 8, not a good sign. Our party of 6 orders a bottle of nice wine, a few beers, and a mixed drink. The bottle of red wine comes out already opened and completely cold. Not chilled, but stored in a refrigerator, which is not what you expect when you buy a $50 bottle of pinot noir. The mixed drink was not made well at all, it tasted like sweet syrup and cheap vodka. The canned beers took 10+ minutes to be brought to the table.

Nevertheless, we proceeded to order appetizers; the Italian sausage and vegetables were tasty, but the formaggio cheese dip looked like it was straight out of a can, and the cheesy-bread looked like a frozen pizza heated in a microwave.

Half of our table received their entrees in a timely manner, while the other half waited 10 minutes with no indication. I understand timing is not always perfect in a restaurant, but our fellow diner's food got cold while we were wondering if our dishes would ever come out.

The pasta dishes were okay, I got the Penne Alla Vodka, which was good but not remarkable, and a small dish for $15 when it's only noodles and sauce.

Our server tried her best, but she revealed to us that we were her first table, and she clearly needed more training. I commend her on her effort, but the management should implement better staffing policies. 

I spoke with the manager about our issues, and he offered only excuses and free shots of vodka. Overall, totally not worth the $200+ tab our 6-top paid for the experience.",17,B,Cheezy's Bistro & Speakeasy,Cheezy's Bistro & Speakeasy,cheezy's bistro & speakeasy,1.0,NEGATIVE

"This Dairy Queen is one of the few fast food places that has managed to stay in business in the Citrus Park area.

Sometimes this DQ's food comes out quickly, sometimes it takes forever. Sometimes the food is hot, sometimes it's not.  Sometimes the place is clean, sometimes it's not. In other words - this place is always a crapshoot - but usually it's okay.

I always get the chicken finger strip basket, which comes with four strips, fries, and bread.  The buffalo sauce they provide to dip in is tasty, and when the French fries are hot, they are delicious.  

For a while the soda machine would always spray wildly when using it, so I have learned to stand back when getting my drink. The last time I was in there that issue seems to have been resolved, though.  Just - be aware.

So I changed it out to a porterhouse.  30 mins later, they brought out a cold rare steak when I said I wanted medium.  So I waited 50 mins for a steak that wasn't cooked. So they brought it back and brought out another rare steak. Then the last time I think they put it on the grill finally and actually grilled it.

"Just OK.....nothing to brag about but was nice to give it a try.  Came her on my lunch break so they weren't busy but did get busier after I ordered.  They do make the sandwiches fresh --- they make it at the front counter w/the ingredients and then send to the back kitchen for them to grill it.  I ordered the Healthy delight which is the grilled cheese w/mozzarella, feta, organic baby spinach, tomatoes, and red onions.  I ordered it on wheat bread.  The cheese was nice and melty, although the feta does not really melt well like the mozzarella and the bread was nice and crispy.  Since the cheese is only added to 1 side of the sandwich it really doesn't seal in the ingredients so as you bite into it, the spinach drops out. This is my only complaint about it.  Lunch was very filling!  The clerk working the counter seemed like she was really interested in being at work today as well -- on her phone when I walked up and no greeting.

Well they did not disappoint. Yet again. We came in while it was raining and the place was not very crowded at all. There were two hostesses at the kiosk and one person waiting in front of us. 

We still waited for close to 3-4minutes even tho the two hostesses did not seem to be busy at all. 

We were seated and had to wait over 10min for one of the hostesses to come to our table. I guess they were doing double duty tonight. She took our drink order and we waited another 10ish minutes. 
They had a vampire drink that was only $1. 
It said it had rum in it. We did not taste any. But they were sweet enough, and were only $1. So.... 

In the time we were waiting for our server two more groups were seated. They got their drinks just as slow. 
Oddly they got their appetizers at the same time ours came out. 20min wait for us... maybe 5-10min for theirs. Then another 10min for another $1 faux rum drink for my gf. I was supposed to get another water but never did. 
By now we've been here about 45-50 and our food came out. At least it was hot and sizzling. 
We got the bourbon street chicken and shrimp. It tasted good. That was a plus at least. We ate and our waitress never came back to check on us. 

Not sure how many tables she had, but she was not on top of her game anyways. Very slow service and forgot my refill my water. I ended up drinking my gf's water anyway. The people behind us were complaining as well about the service.

So after doing an eye exam on my wife's brother-in-law  AKA my sister-in-law's husband (i.e. not my brother), he, my sister-in-law, and I went to Chico's. The place was nearly deserted, even though I would consider 1:30pm still prime lunch time. 

The complimentary chips arrived and this sparked a brief discussion about the fact that they were red, white, and blue. It was suggested that this was in support of the USA in the World Cup, but since they serve them this way all the time, I think it is just an effort to try to be more festive, and less authentic. Yes, blue corn chips do exist, and Red Hot Blues are probably my favorite corn chips ever.  But these aren't as good as those. The salsa was liquidy.

There was a shift transition and none of the new bartenders wanted to help us and the two bartenders that were on there way out didn't have time to serve us. We had to beg for a refill and to order food. We are pretty patient people so when I say we had to beg, it was ridiculous! Then we couldn't get silverware. It was like we didn't matter to the oncoming staff because they weren't going to get tipped out on our meal. And the former bartender just wanted to leave so he wanted us to leave as soon as possible too.

"Tucked squarely in the middle of Armenia Avenue's ""Latin Corridor"" is a small Honduran restaurant and bar, located a few blocks south of Waters Avenue.

The Honduras Café and Carriel Bar sits in a brightly-colored blue building with the traditional yellow, blue, and red stripes found at most Colombian restaurants. Since Honduran cuisine is a fusion of Spanish, Caribbean and African dishes, you can expect to see a lot of your Latin favorites mixed in with more traditional Honduran food. 

Typical Honduran food includes fried fish, tamales, carne asada and baleadas (a flour tortilla which is folded in half and filled with refried beans, quesillo or cheese and sour cream) . Other popular dishes include meat roasted with chismol (similar to a sofrito sauce), chicken with rice and corn, and fried fish with pickled onions and jalapeños. In the coastal areas and in the Bay Islands, seafood and some meats are prepared with coconut milk.

The walls of the Honduras Café are decorated with a series of beautiful photomurals showcasing the countryside of Honduras, and the crystal clear waters of the Bay Islands. There's a pool table on the right which is a big draw with the locals. To the left is the café area with about a dozen tables, and a small bar in the corner.

I ordered a couple of beef empanadas for my lunch, and an order of carne asada estilio Honduras to have later for my dinner. The empanadas had a rich, savory flavor, and when combined with hot sauce they were the perfect size for lunch.

The Honduran carne asada is a traditional dish, similar to steak and potatoes, with fried plantains on the bottom of the plate, then shredded cabbage, onions, tomatoes, shredded strips of beef, and creamy garlic sauce on top. This is a very delicious dish, and well worth a try.

Spanish is the preferred language in this small restaurant, but if you make the effort to learn a few basic phrases they will very happily help you with your order. I thought that the food was tasty, and will be back to try some other dishes.",4,A,Honduras Cafe,Honduras Cafe,H0nduras Cafe,4.0,POSITIVE

The menu was somewhat confusing about specials and combos. Prices were a bit high, but portions were very generous.  Was able to park curbside and were graciously served, esp when we mentioned seeing reviews on Yelp.  We also noted that the Yelp listing early yesterday showed them closing at 5, but in fact the store showed them open until 8.  You will note they promptly updated.

"I have been coming to this bakery for years.  First it was to get a jolt of hot sweet Café Cubano, but then the guava and cheese pastries grabbed hold, and wouldn't let me go.

They also make an incredible guava and cheese bread which is a huge hit during office staff meetings.

Most recently, I have utilized this bakery for their cake making services.  They did a gorgeous job decorating the birthday cake I ordered. And even though English was not her first language, the woman taking the order did an excellent job of getting every detail correct, down to the odd spelling of names.

My family absolutely loved the flavor of the cake and the icing, and even once I confessed that I lied about 'jelly' being the center layer (pickiest eaters ever-could not tell them ahead of time it was guava or they never would have eaten it), they still were raving about the cake.

"So with high expectations my family and I went to this ""landmark"" for dinner.  I'm originally from Tampa and had not been since high school so we all decided to go.  Everyone was ready to have some awesome food.  Things started out well.  The drinks were great and their onion rings were on point.  Then disaster.  My brother ordered the fried shrimp with fries...they looked tired on the plate and the fries were cold and soggy.  My mother ordered the coconut shrimp and baked loaded baked potato.  Out came these cold six little shrimp, without the pineapple dipping sauce, and the most dried up baked potato with the ""loaded"" like baked in and it was hard and cold.  When she asked for the dipping sauce they brought out sour cream...um, NO.  I ordered the blackened swordfish and the loaded potato.  Same thing with the potato and the swordfish had not a stitch of blackened anything and was overcooked and dryer than the Sahara; horrible.  My father's blackened mahi mahi was the same.  In a word our night was ruined and to make it worse, the place wasn't even a third full.  I think the kitchen has significant problems and the waitstaff was just meh.  Never going back.

"I'm moving to FL so figured I'd check out the soul food areas to find the hot spots.  I went here two days in a row w/ hopes the 2nd trip would be better.  The only thing I'd really come back for is the red velvet cake.  I tried all these items (I ate for lunch/dinner over two days so I didn't ""pig out"":) as I was hoping to find some dishes I really liked and would come back for; I hate to waste food, but I ended up throwing away most of the rice, hush puppies, chicken livers, cabbage and sweet potato pie.

1. Mashed Potatoes - B- (tasted like they came out of the box, not mashed/bland)
2. Sweet Potato Pie - C- (tasted old/something was just really off)
3. White Rice/Gravy - C (nothing special about it - seems to just fill the plate); I'd recommend they get rid of the rice and just add the meat in that section of the plate (since they put the meat in a separate take-out plate which could end up being a lot to have to carry out if you're feeding a family); all the food, w/o the rice can easily fit in one take-out plate; I doubt most people eat the white rice anyway considering you've already got two other sides & meat so it's a waist of food.
4. Hush Puppies - F (I asked for some the first day as I love hush puppies, but another customer got the last batch; he ended up getting something to replace them as they came out like potato balls & all dough-like inside (not gonna tell you how I found out); I asked for some the 2nd day hoping for a diff result - they were smaller, but tasted like pure dough on the inside - worst I've ever tasted; threw them away)
5. Corn Bread - C (nothing special; tasted like Jiffy with lots of butter; more moist than Jiffy)
6. Kettle Fried Chicken - B (Seasoned well/moist inside; I'm not a great cook and think I could've done the same thing; I think the grease was a lil too old also)
7. Red Velvet Cake - A+ (super moist; tasted home-made)
8. Lemon Cake - A (super moist/I don't really eat lemon cake so couldn't tell if it was real)
9. Lemonade - A (home-made/tasted pretty good)
10. Collard Greens - B- (nothing special)
11. Green Beans - B (seasoned well/nothing special)
12. Cabbage - C (they put sugar/something sweet in it; would've been okay, but it was way too sweet)
13. Potato Salad - B+ (tasted pretty good)
14. Chicken Livers - F (Chicken livers were very bland and tasted burnt or like they used really old grease)
15. Baked Chicken - B+ (didn't look appealing at all, but tasted good, seasoned well; also moist inside)
16. Baked Mac N Cheese - B+ (seasoned well/tasted alright)

Other: Military Discount a Plus; first day, great customer service/friendly rep; 2nd day, not good customer service and not bad either; I felt like I was being rushed to submit my order the 2nd day (diff lady).

Would I recommend: Not until they fix some of the things above. Hope the fact that I tried about half the stuff on their menu helps them fix some of this stuff so that the rest of you interested folks have a diff experience.

"Why 5 stars? Because as usual, frozen sugar is the key to my heart.

   ---   ---   ---

My favorite marathon runner and fellow frozen sugar connoisseur, Chris W alerted me to this place because he saw HIS favorite tri-athlete post about it on Talk. I have really great friends.

When I arrived, I was bummed because they said they were out of mango, strawberries or boba, which would have been my three top choices for the shaved ice. Eventually, she said that they did actually have boba and that if we wanted, we could wait 15 minutes for her to cut up some mango. I opted for some other things: banana, cantaloupe and some jellies - I actually can't remember everything and if you check out the photo, it's actually pretty difficult to tell.

Speaking of the photo, Olympian Chris W said it looked like a ""monster vomited on a plate,"" and I can't disagree with him. But this shaved ice bowl might win my all-time ""worst-looking, but best-tasting"" award.

Seriously, it was amazing. I loved every bite. Other than wishing I had mango instead of banana, I'd eat this every day and note get bored of it.

"I'm glad we finally have a Poke spot on this side of Tampa! I feel like I've eaten here enough times to give a fair review. My opinion is that you can get a good bowl here, but they are stingy on the scoops of protein and a lot of toppings are extra and not included. Just by adding a few items you'll go from a $10 to a $15 easily. A lot of other places in Tampa do not charge for the extra toppings, but they are much further away. In the end this is only a few minutes away from my house in Westchase, so for now it's my only lunch poke choice. (Note, a new Poke restaurant is opening in Oldsmar just a few miles up the road, so this will not be my only poke choice in the near future).

The Ocean Bowl ($10.88 before extra protein and toppings) and the Poke 88 Bowl ($12.88) are my go to signature bowls. When I did a custom bowl I regretted it because it ended up being more expensive than if I would have received the same exact bowl as an ocean and just added the extras. Either way I will probably never get a bowl that I pay less than $15 leaving here based on my extras.

The first time I came here they weren't stingy with the poke scoops, but every time I've come afterward they barely fill the scoop with fish. Very disappointing especially since these bowls are on the pricier side. Ok...enough about price!

The poke and toppings are very fresh and tasty. The poke 88 sauce and eel sauce are 2 sauces that I like in my bowl. I'm more of a clean eater, so I don't like spicy mayo or anything creamy in my poke bowls. The sushi rice is really good here. I tend to get bowls with only greens, but I won't be doing that again here as my bowls with half salad and half sushi rice have been amazing. 

I really like the marinated tuna better than the Ahi because real poke is marinated fish meat. Marinated tuna is the closest you'll get to Hawaiian poke here...still not it.",26,B,Poke 88,Poke 88,P0ke 88,4.0,NEGATIVE

I was greeted as soon as we walked up to the restaurant and once we got inside the bar is a real show stopper see photo. The decor is very modern eclectic but not kitchy. Burlap signs and pipes. I dig it. 

We were greeted by our waitress Savannah she was upbeat and very knowledgeable. She took awesome care of us and told us about everything we ordered and also informed us about the background of the restaurant. They reuse everything the coasters are from their cardboard boxes. All the furniture is redone. They are farm to table so all the food is fresh. They make all their drinks mixers from scratch as well. 

I started off with a left hook Lucy that was like and Arnold Palmer refreshing and dangerous very easy to drink. Spiced tea-infused vodka, st. germain, lemon, local honey, mint, soda. Soo good. 

Then we got a variety of sides to taste we did the adult Mac and cheese cooked in white wine a bunch of cheese bread crumbs and bacon just delightful. The Brussels they were cooked with bacon and onions and so fresh. We also got the caramelized onion dip is was creamy and rich with a slight sweetness from the onions served with kettle chips which were great on their own. 

I got a second drink I got was called the great escape which was served in a tiki glass and was made with Pineapple-infused rum, guava, pineapple ginger syrup, lime. It was tropical and refreshing. 

We then of course had to get the whiskey cake and man was it decadent definitely meant for sharing. It is comprised of Toffee torte, bourbon anglaise, spiced pecans, whipped cream.

She also wrote down my order, but my burger still came out with lettuce, tomato, and onion, which I had specifically asked not to have. We also waited for a bunch of things after we asked, and had to wait for things you wouldn't normally expect. They're new, but still for sure have some service kinks to work out.

Much credit for $5 pitchers of beer and $2 well drinks on a Wednesday night too. They also have plenty of good tv's that had multiple games going.

"Elmer's Sports Cafe served its purpose for us. A small, cozy, low-key dive bar to grab a cheap drink while waiting for our reservation to be called at a nearby restaurant.

My wife and I had about a 45 minute wait for the Columbia. We started walking Ybor and realizing it was hot out and didn't want to go too far, we ducked into the closest bar.

We took a seat and the bartender was around quick. We each ordered drinks and paid the tab. My wife had a Strongbow and I had a Yuengling. $8.

The few people sitting around were friendly and so was the bartender. We sipped our drinks and looked around. This place reminded me of my usual hang out years back in Ft. Lauderdale.

The rectangle wooden bar, worn, faded but studier than it looks. The bottles, taps and metal ice bins holding beer and ready for a strong mixed drink. There was various decorations on the walls helping to bring together the sports bar theme. A pool table and even a package store for to-go alcohol. It was a blast from the past for me.

"I have been coming to Mario's (formerly Cellin's) for a decade and have never had a bad experience until trying their bfast this am.  Breakfast took 45 mins to arrive and the table of 6 next to us who ordered after us received their food prior to our table of 3.  The server was nice but when I asked why this happened she got flustered and completely abandoned us!  Water was not refilled until asked and check and box for left overs took forever to get (had to go to baker counter to ask for those items too).  Server stated that she had only been there 3 days.  I understand being new at a job but this disaster falls on the mgmt.  There were literally 4 other tables in total and some had been there for a while.  I had to get up a total of 3 times to ask for items such as my order of doughnuts, silverware/napkin set up and then for water and my food.  There were 3 workers standing behind the bakery counter-doing what???  Who knows, but they certainly weren't doing what they needed to be doing.  

Very disappointed-won't be going back.  Shameful because their only saving grace is that the food is pretty good and the coffee/cappuccino were delicious.",29,C,Marios Trattoria And Bar,Marios Trattoria And Bar,marios trattoria and bar,1.0,NEGATIVE

We started going there shortly after it opened and have watched the menu expand, along with the staff. The service was fairly slow a couple of the times we went with big groups due to the lack of staff, but it seems to have changed. 
We visited just this morning and enjoyed our favorite cappuccinos! We also shared an egg, pancake, and bacon breakfast that is simple but filing. 
My actual favorite menu item is the Beansy - beans, egg, sausage, peppers, and provolone on bread - delicious! I almost always order it.

"This has turned into my ""go to"" spot for ""to go"" food when we have family in town. Most of them beg to order from here every time they visit.

I discovered this place years ago when I was walking by and smelled the most amazing aroma of their chicken cooking. It is the most enticing smell and reminds me of an open pit barbecue. 

We always get the rotisserie chicken with French fries (just had it again two days ago). It is quite possibly the best rotisserie chicken that I've ever had. Juicy and full of flavor with their marinate. Just make sure to get extra black mint sauce and mayonesa. Their anticuchos are also delicious and very tender.

The only bad thing I have to say is that when they renovated and expanded some time ago, it seems like their quality started diminishing some around the same time frame. I'm not sure if it is under new ownership or whether they changed something in the kitchen but the food is just not quite the same as it was years ago. The chicken is a little drier and sometimes more inconsistent. That being said, they still remain at the top of my list for great chicken.",19,B,Norkys,Norkys,Norkys,5.0,POSITIVE

The King Fish dish was bad or probably bad idea to order it, whatever the sauce was okay but the fish was stale, smelled bad. Yuca wasn't great either. Grilled check was so-so.

The only good thing was the yellow rice - it was rather fantastic - hoped it had a nice cuban or latin curry with it. The savior were the prices, got like 3 dishes and the bill was still 22 bucks and for a guy flying from NYC, although the food wasn't good I will call it peace.

After waiting for 30 min we became curious as to why it was taking so long and why people who ordered after us received their food. About 45 min after waiting an associate came from outback with a stained untucked shirt and backwards visor and did apologize for the wait and explained their computer system was down and the back of the receipt did not print. This would be fine but it was not busy and the 2 ladies at the counter knew what we ordered so there should be no reason for a computer being down when every ones order after us was not ruined.

They sell Italian pastas, olive oil, cookbooks, and have a dessert counter for Italian pastries, gelato, coffee and cookies. Now on to ordering. The process was simple and menus are readily available. Our group ordered the antipasto plate, chicken parmigiana, gnocchi and a Caesar salad with grilled shrimp. We enjoyed all of our dishes. The only issue was that we received chicken on the Caesar salad instead of shrimp, but they offered a side of shrimp or a new salad. They served focaccia with a seasoned olive oil dip for the table.

"********  IGNORE THE 3, 4 AND 5 STAR REVIEWS  *******

Here we have the textbook definition of an overrated Tampa restaurant that is in fact a total and complete shithole.

Case in point. Went here for breakfast (at new Tahitian Inn location) and my dining companion had the good sense to ask the waitress whether the sausage gravy was from a can. I sort of thought it was a rude question, because there's no way it could be, right? Especially not a 4-star rated breakfast place on Yelp, where people talk about the ""home-cooked"" food?

And then the waitress said ""It's from a can.""

Who serves people sausage gravy from a can? Pach's Place does!

The rest of the food, from the bacon to the french toast to the eggs, tasted artificial and was just plan horrible. The bacon was thin and horrible quality. The eggs tasted artificial. Everything pretty much tasted like it was microwaved. For the love of God, do not even think about ordering a biscuit. I think the ones from a fast-food drive through are better.

The only people who could possibly think this is good food is people who A, don't have taste buds, or B, eat Stouffer's frozen meals daily from a microwave, and think this is a step up from that.

It is a step up from Stouffer's, but not a big step.

Absolute terrible service . For starters we were on the patio which was filthy every table was dirty there was trash out on the patio and we were literally the first customers there for the day so that should have been clean. We started off with chips and the queso and guac and salsa the chips were stale their guacamole sucked the queso sucked. Literally being the only table there and anytime we needed a drink we had to get up go in and find the server to ask for a drink she never once came out and checked on us to see how we were doing. Then the last time we went into ask her for the check when she came and put the check on the table she said sorry she got busy literally we were the only table there . And she never once tried to pre buss our table we had to just put our dishes at the end of the table which they all sat there until we left.,40,C,Applebee's Grill + Bar,Applebee's Grill + Bar,Appl3b33's Grill + Bar,1.0,NEGATIVE

Both of ours were dipped in milk chocolate and then coated with sprinkles. My toddlers enjoyed every bite.

I also ordered two drinks. One drink was more creamy/smoothie like and mixed with strawberry and mango. The other drink wasn't creamy and was a mix of blueberry and lime. It was so refreshing and had real blueberries. Both drinks were delicious.

My boyfriends beer was forgotten and when she was reminded, it took about 15 minutes for it to come.

The service is on point today. Very nice attentive service that we have received. The serve also good on pushing the sales on other dishes and dessert. Carrabba's are generally generous on the portion of food. We always stuff coming out of the restaurant. 

Let talk about the food. We got the mussel with white wine butter sauce. The sauce is perfect. The mussel are the best among the Carrabba's chain. They know how to clean and cook it soft without overcook them. 

The entrée of the bone in ribeye was cook to the temperature. Unfortunately their Steak skill need to be improved. But they are better than the average restaurant. The meat need to completely cook but left the inward red on medium rare. They are more to medium. The meat has more tendon attached to it and tough to bite on certain portions.

I had the Salmon flatbread, which was really good, but I as soon as I saw it I felt like... ""oh! ok! I could make this at home"". It just wasn't worth the inflated price. Again, it was good, but it would have been just as good and half the price had I made it for myself at home. 

My dining companion had the duck confit and she legitimately could have knocked on the table with it. She said it tasted fine, it was just difficult to eat because the outside was SO. HARD.

"First punch: the smell whoomps you when you exit the car. Second punch: the food's taste. Suddenly you're a zombie who needs meat!

My Hawaiian visiting friends tell me ""Da Kine"" means ""something something"" or ""whatever"" in Hawaiian-- the SMELL is definitely DA KINE! Grilled meats, spices and saucy smoke fill the air. If I was a chicken about to die, this is the way I'd go.

MENU: Most items are different types of seasoned and grilled meats that come in three sizes. The small combo was the right size for me (small prices from $6-8) and came with rice and macaroni salad. (I don't eat much to begin with and the small size left me with two meals) The largest size can feed two people.

Our food came out fast. My Combo #14 was a collection of three meats: shoyu chicken, Hawaiian steak, and sweet ribs... WHOA!! Talk about seasoned! Not salty, not spicy--but think grilled flavors! Hints of citrus in the pork and ribs. The chicken was my favorite--shredded with familiar Asian flavors. The rice was very welcoming to balance out the strong tastes... but I needed more rice. The macaroni salad confused me (do I eat it like an appetizer?) but I liked it because it wasn't drowned mayo and unnecessary crap like other macaroni salads.

I also bought the extra sauce as others suggested (like a sweet, teriyaki sauce) but didn't need it because of how strong the grilled flavor was. I can see how others might like to add the sweetness to their meal--not me. My friends tried the Sunday omelet (grilled sausages with egg) and used the sauce to add more flavor and moistness.

The guys who took our orders were all serious no fun--probably a long day for them.
Two picnic tables decorate the side of the truck--no bathrooms here... but there's a small park a block away with extra tables,  bathrooms, and people watching ^_^

"ok, this place rocks. I come from California, where our supposed weather is like Greece and you would assume that most other places that serve gyro or the like are similar or better. This just isn't the case, the gyro is perfect. LITERALLY PERFECT, it's melting in with a perfect amount of feta cheese, yogurt, and gyro mixing in my mouth as I take savory bite after savory bite... I opted for double meat, for double awesome. If I had one complaint, it was that they stuffed the pita too full so it broke apart midway, bursting from the seams with meat and veggies. I got messy with my fingers to eat every last scrap that had fallen on the wrapping paper. My god, I thought. this is it.  This is thing that will make me miss Tampa, because even Northern California (famous for it's amazing foodie places) has nothing on this place. Also, it's open till midnight, so you can grab a late bite long after pretty much every other place other than bars have closed.

As if I didn't have enough to rave about this place, they allow you to customize your pita! I've never encountered a place that does that like Subway with pitas. It makes sense, but man, they totally delivered where everyone else had a missed opportunity!

The only downside is the parking, which is not free (for the street) until 6pm.

"If you work in and around Carillon Parkway, I can't recommend this place enough. In fact, my only complaint is that I wish there were weekend hours! I've been twice, and I can't wait to go again.

First visit: I order the Sunny Bird sandwich (toasted) because it comes with cream cheese and sunflower seeds. I order a water to go along, and eat outside. As I am cleaning up after a delicious sandwich, I realize that I was not charged for the bottled water. I go back inside and ask to pay for the water. I was told this was very nice of me, so I made the point of saying that I didn't want to incur bad karma.

Second visit: I call in an order of the same sandwich (YUM) and stop by to pick it up. As I am pulling in, I realize (sheepishly) that I forgot my wallet at home. I walk in, tell the cashier, offering to give my credit card number, as it's stored in my phone. The cashier talks with who I assume to be the manager (the same person I spoke with to pay for the water). She gave me my sandwich and told me to just come by next time and pay. I was so warmed to have been treated with trust. It made me feel like a human and it wasn't an embarrassing experience at all, though it could have been.

"This restaurant has potential however they are extremely under staffed. I blame management, the staff tried to be as accommodating as they possibly could & I genuinely feel bad for them. But they were just full of excuses regarding the delay in the food coming out. The waitress blamed the fact that we ordered different things as the reason why orders were coming out incomplete (meat with no side) cooked food vs grilled food. Then she blamed the kitchen staff then blamed it in them being short staffed. Then said she was just coming back to work after a long time of being gone. Too many excuses that I really didn't need to hear or care to hear. Too many mistakes in the orders coming out. We weren't the only table unsatisfied. I saw at least 5 tables of unhappy customers trying to flag down staff. My advice to the owner is to hire more staff including a manager. You will absolutely lose business if you keep this trend going. I am definitely disappointed in my experience.",13,A,Sa Ri One Grill,Sa Ri One Grill,Sa Ri On3 Grill,3.0,NEGATIVE

"We went to lunch here on a weekday, on my husband's lunch hour. The service is VERY FRIENDLY, but not the fastest. We did not make it in and out in a timely fashion for an office lunch break. And it's not like the place was that busy. He ordered the stromboli and I ordered a salad. When the food came out, they brought a calzone....so that's one reason why it took longer than it should have. (Though, the strombolis and calzones are pre made, so the fact it took so long for the mistaken calzone to reach our table is a little bewildering.) I ordered the basic tossed salad. For $7.50 I was very disappointed. One, The portion was not worth $7.50. And two, for basic Romain lettuce, tomatoes, olives and a few croutons, you think they can add in some provolone or mozzarella cheese or even some rolls or bread. I did ask our server to bring some rolls or bread, and he did so. The Italian bread turned out to be very nice. My husband's Stromboli was delicious. And that in itself is a reason to return.

"I'd like to preface my review with stating that I am a vegan who goes out of my way to promote and support vegan establishments on the internet.
It would take a lot for me to publicly write a negative review. I was very excited to eat here, being from out of town and seeing such positive reviews. I was there around 4 PM on a Sunday and the inside food hall where it's located, was jam-packed with people in lines for food at other vendors, no one in masks.  Dharma Southern Kitchen really should have just closed up shop for the day because they had a line of customers, but once you got to the front you were given a menu with every single item CROSSED out (unavailable). I was able to just get some of their fried chickn with curly fries. The employee said they charged me for a bowl, but took off the extras I wasn't getting, but still 2 meals and a small cup of Mac N Cheese came to over $30.  It also took about a half hour to get the food, which was pretty crazy considering there was hardly any food to give us.
The chickn was COVERED in dripping oil. It had no taste to it, like puffed-air covered in oil.  I was burping oil the rest of the night and my lips felt so greasy. The mac and Cheese was overcooked pasta and tasteless sauce.  I was so disappointed in my meal here. I thought I'd at least get the pickles with my meal but the employee didn't mention those weren't available either.

"I chowed down here back in 2004, and had Yelp been around I would have written the same review I am writing today.

After what seems like years of La Tropicana sitting vacant, they have (at some point) re-opened under new management.  Curious as to what has or hasn't changed, we decided to swing in and grab a light lunch.  What I found was that nothing has really changed, not even the furniture.

I got a half Cuban, which was edible, but won't be winning any awards at the next Cuban Sandwich Throwdown.  There was half a slice of salami, very little pork and by default it included lettuce and tomato.  I did see some reviews where folks belly-ached about it not being pressed, but I'm on the fence about that since pressing them is a recent development in the history of the sandwich.  So one could argue that they're going for actual authenticity, but then if that was the case, it wouldn't have had lettuce and tomato.  Either way, it is not a difficult sandwich to make, so how so many people get it wrong is beyond me, especially in Ybor.  

I got a side of black beans on the side, and it was right on.  So like I said, everything was edible, but nothing to rave about.

"Picture this, me and my friend, driving home from Citrus Park Mall. It's about 10:20 PM. We glance at each other, eager to share our thoughts and quickly express our desire to indulge in two Small french vanilla iced coffees. He whips out his phone, a trusted iPhone X, and quickly starts tapping, fingers crossed that our favorite coffee stop would still be open. ""W Waters, closes soon (11PM)"" 
Ah-ha! We're in luck! Still roughly 30 minutes until they are set to close. We make a dash for the drive through and i enthusiastically roll down my window and simultaneously turn down my music for optimal audio connection with my lovely Dunkin Franchise employee. We sit in a comfortable silence, awaiting the delicious ring of a voice through the drive through speaker; however we hear nothing. Nada, Zero. We look at each other,
puzzled. We wait a good 5 minutes and still no service. At this point, we are beyond disappointed. 30 minutes until closing time, why aren't we being served. We must think fast. Time is running out, my mother is hot on my tail, refreshing my location. I switch my car into drive and we pull around the corner and up to the window.
expecting to approach an empty store however, that was the opposite of our findings. There, through the small rusted drive through window, we see not one, but TWO Dunkin' donuts associates standing there looking back at us. One being a young man, blonde with an earring. We had an encounter with him previously. He was very kind hearted, a comical man  however that is besides the point. The other employee being a middle aged woman. We were both aggravated and enthralled. They ignored us, however now that they are aware of our presence, we should be able to proceed to pull back around and get our order taken properly. But oh how wrong we were. We turn the corner: tires skidding. wheel turned a full 180. Excitement pulsates through our veins as we approach the window for the second time before their designated closing time [11 PM in case you missed it the first time]. But to our surprise, there was so voice there to greet us. Me and my
pal look at each other, disbelief displayed across our faces. We slowly pull away, traumatized and completely stripped of our identities and confidence. Never again will i visit this franchise.

"I'm struggling a bit with giving 3 or 4 stars because there were some food issues but the customer service was outstanding and I am so excited to have an option for grilled chicken tenders that I'm going with 4 stars. 

We ordered online and picked up our order curbside. It was very easy to order and a really nice woman walked our order out to the car almost immediately when we arrived. I wish I had gotten her name because she  was a definite bright spot in my day! She was probably 5'7, average size, black woman with long, beautiful braided hair she had pulled back. She wore a mask out to deliver our order and took the time to talk with me. I had ordered tea and saw there was an option for peach tea but it didn't say if there was an unsweetened peach option, so I ordered unsweetened tea but wrote in the comments that I'd love peach if it didn't have sugar added. When I arrived, she had made me both because the peach is a sweetener from fruit which is added but she wanted me to be able to try it. That was so nice of her and The Hatchery to do that for a customer. She also let me know that I could customize my order next time to get half regular/half spicy, grilled chicken tenders or any other combo I wanted. 

The food: I wanted to like it more because I eat keto and it's fabulous to find grilled chicken tenders! There was only a side salad option along with a kale coleslaw that might fall in the keto friendly. I was hoping maybe I could have the coleslaw but it definitely had a lot of sugar in it, so I didn't eat my side. I did taste it and if I weren't on keto, it may have been good. I'd love for them to add 1 more healthy side other than a salad but I know that's not easy since others don't eat the same way. 
Of course, I got the grilled chicken tenders. I ordered the regular and one extra spicy tender so I could assess the heat level. My boyfriend got the same but breaded/fried tenders. He was not happy with his tenders and didn't like the breading much. I actually really liked my grilled fingers and would definitely order the spicy again because they are not hot but have a good flavor if you like some spice. I got honey mustard and the hatch sauce for dipping, I really liked the hatch sauce. 

I'm trying to convince my boyfriend to give this another go and to try the grilled tenders instead of fried because I'm still very excited to have grilledoptions. I think he will give in and we will order again!

We decided to go to the actual restaurant for breakfast.  It is tucked away, honestly not easy to get to.  However, the food is great at really good prices.

It is a diner type of environment, so don't expect it to be amazing inside.  It is clean and quite large though.

It's obvious we were forgotten and then not made a priority to get our food quickly. They simply did not care when we got our pizza.

"This place is what I would call a ""light"" deli.  Meaning there's a leaning towards more healthy/vegetarian friendly dishes, the sandwiches are reasonably sized rather than falling over from being overstuffed, flatbreads focusing on grilled offerings, and a large selection of salads.

The place is small, but can seat 10-15 without too much trouble.

The Manhattan (""essentially a Ruben, you just get to chose your meat"") was well done, showed up very hot but didn't have the browned bread and crunch I was expecting from a grilled sandwich. 

Obviously, I prefer an ""un-light"" deli.  This is more a cafe, really.  Nice people, healthy food, bright clean surfaces and no salami hanging from the roof?  Where's my abuse, fried comfort food, and unctuous reek of cheese, meats, and baked pastas available by the pound?

Still, this will be a fine lunch option for most office workers, and prices are reasonable.  I'll go back and try a burger, but in my heart of hearts this is a cafe, not a deli.",11,A,The Real Dill Delicatessen,The Real Dill Delicatessen,Th3 R3al Dill D3licat3ss3n,2.0,POSITIVE

"Ordered: 
Shrimp Toast
Orange Chicken
General Tsao

The shrimp toast was OK, I had it for leftovers the next day and became sick as a dog.  I did not research if they use MSG which could be why I felt that way.

Orange chicken was bla.  All you could taste was the citrus flavor of the orange and no combination with the sauce.  It was way too over powering.

The General Tsao was pretty good.

"The presentation of the Lilac Lilly (made with taro shaved ice) was great. The place is cute and clean with great chandeliers that mimic ice. Just wish the customer service was up to par. Now, I don't like to base my review on 1 bad egg, but it sure does make a lasting first impression. 
The girl behind the counter Friday night was on her phone and had a scowl on her face (and this is while she was wearing a mask, can you imagine how deep her expression had to be to catch this?) I initially asked about the popsicles that are prominently displayed upon walking in- I asked if any of them were dairy-free. She responded with, ""I don't know, they don't tell us.""

Interesting. I proceeded to the shaved iced concoctions. I knew the taro one had dairy but I brought my little Lactaid pill with me and bit the bullet. Again, the presentation is beautiful, and I guess this is where the girl excels as a worker. But the customer service between her and those I encountered at Kelp, the sushi joint next door, was just night and day. 

Little did I know, Kelp, the sushi joint next door is owned by the same owners. I initially came here for a small dinner followed by dessert while eating indoors.

I asked the girl what the Wi-Fi info was. Again, she looked annoyed, and said there is no Wi-Fi. I proceeded to show her the 2 networks associated with Nice. She said, ""I don't know, they don't tell us."" I said, hm, just like you don't know if the products you sell have dairy in them?

She left the store. I figured she was having a bad day. However, not 1 but 2 girls came from Kelp and told me the Wi-Fi info for Kelp. I thanked all the girls and am proceeding to eat my monster Sexy Geisha roll that was kindly recommended by the young gentleman at Kelp while typing this up!

"And the award for best spring roll goes to ...drumroll...this place! There's a Yelp check-in offer going on right now where these are free as well, but I'd be more than happy to pay for what I found inside of these rice paper rolls of deliciousness. Be sure to bring cash as you have to make a large order to meet the 10.00 debit/credit card limit they have here since their prices are so fair. Tang is helpful and friendly, so don't be afraid to try something new, he won't steer you wrong. Although a huge bowl of hot Pho might warm the cockles of your heart, I think the real winner here is the spring rolls. I've searched far and wide for such pleasantly plump shrimp and pork ones like they have here. No skimping on the noodles held within, and they totally killed it with the peanut sauce. Pholicious doesn't even come close. Never mind that they can be free due to check-in, and that they offer amazing looking sandwiches as well!

"Yesterday I had the unfortunate experience of going to the Tea Rose cottage in Ybor with my daughter, my two friends and their daughters. I rarely post negative reviews, but this time I am compelled.  I had a very poor experience. I would not recommend it for you or any of my friends. The owners, waitress, and chef (same people) were not only rude from the start (unhappy when we tried to increase our reservation by one...who is displeased by MORE business?!) One 3 year old child in our party unexpectedly fell sick,  was visibly crying and had to leave (before being served, touching any dishes nor napkins ). The owner was visibly unhappy that 4 customers who were on the reservation had to leave. Notably, there were 3 vacant tables around us so clearly, no customers were turned away due to out reservation. The owner had the audacity to charge us for two adults and two children who were never served nor consumed any food nor beverage(full price)! To add insult, gratuity was pre-added in for 4 absent customers. We were informed that is their policy and that all the food was prepared specifically for us ahead of time. When we questioned them and said we have never heard of such a policy at any restaurant, nor were we ever informed of this policy when we made the reservation, they shrugged their shoulders and said - well, what do you expect us to do? Important to note, this is a teahouse where there is a fixed menu and nothing is specifically ordered nor specifically chosen from the menu. In fact, one main item served was PB&J (not a large monetary investment for a restaurant!). When we asked to try a different kind of tea, they expected us to finish the tea that was in our cup, wait until they washed out our teacup before serving us the new tea. (I am pretty sure, this is not a British tradition.)  Even though there were empty teacups available at the next place setting, they did not want us to use more than one tea cup per person! It was incredulous, inconsiderate, and has/will lead to loss of current and future customers. The policy is even more hypocritical since they do not take a credit card number when making a reservation. Hence, we may have not showed up at all and not have been responsible for any payment!
After I vehemently complained, they unhappily reduced the charges from 80+ dollars to 50+ dollars. They removed the gratuity and subtracted the charges for one adult. As I left, they apologized that I had a poor experience. This weak apology in no way makes up for the fact that we were never informed about their completely unfair and inappropriate policy, and that they incredulously expected us to be responsible for payment of four absent customers!",29,C,Tea Rose Cottage,Tea Rose Cottage,Tea Rose Cottage Inc.,1.0,NEGATIVE

"I had a new waiter, no fault to him, but he was totally untrained, no excuse to the restaurant. I asked him to explain the difference between the four types of chicken kababs and he had to go back and came back with poor explanations. I told him I wanted it on rice - he told that it was not good on rice. What? An Indian restaurant without saffron rice? The rice came about 2-3 minutes after the entree, so it was useless, because I wanted the kabab on a bed of rice. 

The kebab was sizzling - I had never had it that way and it was excellent. With the mint sauce it was wonderful, spicy enough to be barely felt in the nose. 

The nan was below average. Only after the meal was served and I asked why the nan wasn't crispy, and dark brown did the manager come out to help. He replaced at no charge the nan with crispy butter nan; it was still below average. He explained that Indian natives eat whole wheat bread: roti. I noted it was not on the menu.

"A spontaneous addition to a video I made this summer set off a chain of events, mostly of the mundane run-of-the-mill variety, that led me to the Ybor Daily Market on Saturday. It was here that the Vegg'd Out Vegan Kitchen was setting up shop for their Vegan Dessert Fest. It was an event that they had dubbed Bettersweetz.

The Vegg'd Out Vegan Kitchen was established early last year as a vegan delivery, pre-paid meal plan, catering service that serves the Tampa area. The don't have a brick and mortar building of their own so they've sold a lot of their foods from the open air center of the Ybor Daily Market. They are known for their bevy of vegan treats including raw CheeseKakez, pies, CupKakez and cookies, as well as educational food prep classes. They hope to promote clean eating by including only organic ingredients in their products which are all, according to their order flyer, ""crafted with authentic love.""

The Bettersweetz setup consisted of three tables. One table took care of all the payments. The other two were completely loaded with desserts. The one nearest the entrance was filled with a variety CupKakez and CheeseKakez. The other table contained the pies, brownies and cookies. I was drawn to the CupKakez first. Flavors included marble swirl, apple and peanut butter cup. I selected the latter two, although I could've seen myself taking all three home. They looked at that good. At the cookie table, I really wanted to check out the sweet kale pie but couldn't bring myself to pay the steep nine dollar a slice price. Instead I opted for an almond butter and goji berry cookie. I cashed out at 13 dollars for the three desserts. One thing is pretty clear when it comes to vegan desserts, they are definitely not cheap.

The apple cupcake was the first to cross my lips. It was a spiced cake that was topped with an apple flavored icing. I was absolutely astounded at the moistness of the cake and the creaminess of the icing. The flavors that stood out weren't the vegan dessert buzz killers of fake butter or super sugar. I tasted apple and spice. These two complimented each other well. I found myself wishing I hadn't stopped at buying just one of these cupcakes.

Next up was the almond butter and goji berry cookie. The cookie wasn't thick, soft and gooey like I prefer my cookies, it was much flatter with a crisp exterior and a soft interior. The almond butter was much more subtle than a lot of the peanut butter cookies I've had through the years. I hoped for a bit more from the goji berries. If I hadn't seen them, I wouldn't have even known they were in there. A decent treat but I wouldn't do it again. If I'm going to spend, I'm going to get me something that is iced.

The peanut butter cup was a chocolate cupcake with peanut butter icing and a vegan peanut butter cup on top. If looks could kill, this CupKakez would be a mass murderer. It was the best looking of the three desserts by far. The cake part of it was a bit drier than the previous cupcake. I'm not sure if this was due to the way it was baked or that it sat around in the cardboard box longer than the other desserts did. But that icing, whoa baby, that was some good stuff. It was intensely rich and tasted of pure peanut butter gold. Definitely a dessert worth doing again.

It has been a tough go finding good vegan desserts in Tampa. My search, as long as I can track them down on the regular, may have just ended.

The Sesame Chicken with White Rice was also good. Like many Chinese dishes, this dish tasted better on the reheat the next day. The General Tsos' Chicken was good but not outstanding, and the Orange Chicken was ho-hum. I didn't order or eat the Egg Foo Young, but someone else did, and they devoured it.

   ---   ---   ---

After my first visit, I was immediately a huge fan of Snowman. I didn't think I could be any more smitten, but visit #2 hooked me even more so.

I'd been hardcore craving an egg waffle, and I actually went to another business to get it. When I arrived, I discovered, to my horror, that it had been taken off the menu. Despite still grabbing some delicious treats at said business, I still HAD to have the egg waffle. I remembered that they served them at Snowman, so we headed straight here!

Much to my delight, the egg waffle was available, and that's exactly what I ordered. I ordered the snow ice on my first visit here, so I combined my two loves during this trip: snow ice on top of an egg waffle! My dreams came true.

It was everything I'd hoped it would be. And when I say I built egg waffle desire up in my mind, I mean I was practically fantasizing about it all week. I dreamed of a life where we would grow old together. And it still lived up to the hype!

The reality was the Pho, was just average . No generous portion or low price. If I wanted Pho, I can think of many other places in town to go & be more of a happy camper.
It is an unusual spot for this type of food, which is why I was so very happy to see it.
Alas, the food was bland and dry. I was so stoked about this location, I tried everything not to be let down, but, when all was tasted, I was quite let down & my expectations plumeted. There was no depth of flavor.

"I. Love. This. Place.

My brother worked at Larry's back in Gainesville when we were both going to UF, and we couldn't get enough of the place. Once we graduated, it had been ages since we saw another Larry's again in any of the cities we lived or traveled to. 

As I was researching what places would be able to make a 6ft sub for my boyfriend (one of his requests for his birthday in April), I stumbled upon the location on Kennedy in Tampa. Next thing that happened = smile on my face. 

Not only was the sub abso-freakin-lutely delicious, but they even delivered it to the house so I wouldn't have to figure out how the heck I'd have to fit a 6ft sub in my car. One bite and I knew this was most definitely the Larry's I fondly remember, and we've been going there for subs ever since. 

The ingredients are super fresh, the choices, abundant (and creative!) and the service is awesome. Another crazy fact: a Larry's sub will stay good for a remarkably long time (if you have a decent fridge of course). The onions they use are also some kind of special because we've never tasted such yummy freshly sliced onions on a sandwich, ever.

Our favs: The Ultimate (a hot sub with Black Angus roast beef, roasted turkey breast & ham) and the Italian Big One (a cold Italian hoagie with ham, cooked & genoa salami, beef bologna & pepperoni). 

Don't forget to get their special sub sauce either, you'll thank me.",15,B,Larry's Giant Subs,Larry's Giant Subs,larry's giant subs,4.0,POSITIVE

Our main dish is Breaded steak with rice and fried cassava. The breaded coating has some seasoning spice. It the best Colombian breaded steak I have. It is big piece. 

Our next dish is Bandeja di Mi Tierra. It has skirt steak, chicharron, chorizo, sweet plantain, creole potatoes. This is big combination dish. It has great churrasco. The the steak is well seasoning. The chicharron is very crispy and is not tough to bite. I like this dish have a lot to offer.

For some reason I didn't process that the Robin Hood was a cold sandwich so I was  a teensy bit heartbroken when I got it, but it was still good. I'm sure if I was craving a cold sandwich my enthusiasm for this bad boy would be completely different. 

Robin Hood: The pumpernickel bread was so soft and fluffy. The lettuce crisp and crunchy. The bacon was crunchy as well. That sauce was pretty tasty, a bit too much sauce for my taste but good flavor.

"Walking in the vibe and feel isn't much, but I quickly discovered they put plenty of love into the food. I will say that are in the process of remodeling the place. The have a Brazilian buffet that is priced by the pound. It's a simple buffet with a few meat and chicken offerings, plus vegetables and fruit. I opted for a grilled chicken entree with rice, beans, fries, farofa and salad. Because I'm on Weight Watchers right now, I skipped on the rice and fries, they gave me some mixed vegetables instead. Clock time from order to table was 22 minutes. I typically like under 20 for a lunch break. 
The food, great, portions, great. The service was friendly. They actually gave me three chicken breasts with my entree. All that for $10, DEAL!!!

"One of my favorite restaurants to go to because of two of my favorite foods being served under one roof: Pizza and Cheesecake!!! Grimaldi's makes thin crust New York style pizzas. Apparently they use New York water in order to create authentic tasting New York pizza dough. The results are delicious. I get a nice thin crust that's crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside. I'm a sucker for white pizza, so I either choose their Quattro Formaggio or the Classic White with garlic. Both are different in that the latter is your usual white pizza while for the former as more bite to it from the gorgonzola cheese. My pizza that I got today was the Quattro Formaggio with ricotta cheese (an extra $2). The four cheeses melted together perfectly creating this creamy texture from the ricotta and the sharp flavor from the gorgonzola. I had the personal pizza with every intent to eat it all, but my twin, who is a picky eater, had two slices. Of course, my visit is never complete without their cheesecakes! They are some of the freshest, creamiest cheesecakes around and come in a variety of flavors depending on the season. Every January so far, they've carried my favorite of all time, their amaretto cheesecake made with amaretto cookie crust, amaretto New York cheesecake, toasted almonds and whipped cream. Creamy, not too sweet, with some fluffy texture as the fork rakes through the cake. I love the slightly browned top of the cheesecake filling.

"Happy to have found this place and satisfy a Korean food craving. We didn't do the barbecue but just opted to order some other entrees. The gimbab was really tasty and we got the beef bulgogi.

The fries that came with us was also unexpected because ya know..fries lol but something about the way they cooked it, *chef's kiss* I got the Korean bbq pork belly and that came with rice and a bunch of different banchans. Soo good! Their kimchi and pickled cucumber as well as the seaweed salad had really great flavors. 

Service was quick despite being short staffed. It just meant that you weren't constantly interrupted or feel like they are hovering. 

I would've given 5 stars if they had bingsu. I was really looking forward to dessert. I didn't quite understand if they were out or don't serve it anymore, disappointing because they had a giant drawing on their wall for it

You can see the sign from the Busch Gardens entrance area. I was intrigued by a combination of Chinese and Latin food and I'm always up to try new things. We were a bit hesitant after reading some of he reviews but I wanted to try it anyways. It's a typical takeout joint with about 6-8 tables for dining. When we first got there it was empty but by the time we got our food the tables were full and a line in the waiting area. We were there Saturday night at around 8pm. The portions were large and the taste was good! My husband says it's the best orange chicken he's ever had!  There were strips of orange rind in the sauce and had a nice orange flavor. The mofongo was interesting. Can't say too much about it as I've never had it before and have nothing to compare it to but it was okay. Don't know if I'll order it next time.

No smile, nothing. She was way more interested in people she knew the faces of than the ones she didn't such as myself. When I ordered my food she rolled her eyes when I asked for blue cheese and celery. When my wings arrived they were not breaded even though she had asked me if I wanted them breaded or not, coming here specifically for that. I ate and never said a word. I was never checked on again until I was finished with my food. While sitting at the bar I witnessed the man next to me order a yuengling bottle and her pour him a draft.

"If Buffaloes can have wings then why not big ol' honkin' elephant wings? Well, that's the premise behind the Pachyderm Wing Company, and you're in for a real treat when you stop here.

The Pachy is located along Kennedy directly across the road from the University of Tampa's big stadium. The crowd is comprised of local business folks and 20-somethings, along with the UT students that live within walking distance. There's plenty of room to eat in the downstairs bar area, plus there is an entire second floor with another bar and dining area, and a large outdoor patio for those who want to kick back and enjoy the weather.

They have a full bar for crafted cocktails and shots, as well as plenty of beers on tap, and you'll see a number of drink specials every night. Laura was my bartender / server tonight, and we had a great chat all about the place. With her help I ordered a dozen of the elephant wings seasoned with spicy garlic sauce, seasoned pachy fries, celery and homemade blue cheese dressing. The wings were excellent! Lots of meat with a flavorful sauce that had the bite of the garlic along with the balanced heat of the hot sauce. 

The chef came out later in the evening and we were discussing his homemade sauces versus the usual vinegar-based super hot seasonings that leave your tongue on fire and a funky after taste. No, this sauce was definitely hot, but it had a nice flavor profile, and no greasy after taste.

Laura tells me that I need to come back and try their 9-ounce homemade hamburgers sometime. They add a variety of herbs and veggies into the burger patty before tossing it onto the grill, and serving it up on a pretzel bun. I've already had the seasoned thick-cut pachy fries, and they were a winner, so I'm sure the burgers will be legendary.

They stay open until about Midnight each night, and on the weekends they're open into the wee hours, so be sure to add this place onto your late-night beer & munchies radar screen. They're starting a Ladies Night, and different specials to bring in the locals.

"The hubs and I tried this restaurant on Valentine's Day. They did not have a Valentine's Day Dinner Menu so this review is based on the current menu. 

Appears to be located in a building with other businesses so you can forget about self-parking. The only option is to valet but it is ""complimentary"". 

This is a restaurant that takes reservations. The ambiance of the restaurant gave me a ""modern city restaurant vibe"" with indoor and outdoor seating. We opted to sit inside due to the weather. The restaurant is an open concept, however there is no privacy as the tables are extremely close to each other and the distance from one end of the table to the other end is so long that you are either leaning over a lot to have a private conversation or you are just talking loud or you feel like you are in the other table's convo. Lol

I thought the food was delicious...from the butternut squash to the Wagyu beef. It was filling and tasty. The sourdough bread was ok but the complementary butter was phenomenal. The bread is NOT complimentary FYI. I wasn't a huge fan of the dessert even though it was visually appealing. I would definitely try them again though if you are close to Bayshore Blvd in Tampa.",3,A,Counter Culture,Counter Culture,C0unter Culture,4.0,POSITIVE

"The verdict is still out on Jersey Mike's subs. I tried their Philly cheese steak with onions, peppers and of course cheese and was pretty disappointed. The ratio of onions and peppers to meat was way off.  There were more vegetables than meat. And then the ratio of filling to bread was once again way off with there being much more bread than filling. The sandwich filling itself had a very good flavor in the meat was not tough. The onions and peppers could have stayed to be cooked longer and the bread was pretty good. I wouldn't say it's the best submarine type roll I've had but it's definitely not the worst.

They were pretty busy and I guess I had to wait about 20 minutes to get my sandwich but, it wasn't overly busy that the quality of food should have suffered. I've heard a lot of great things about this place and was really looking forward to having a Philly  steak hoagie here.

Philly cheese steaks are one of my favorite sandwiches and my favorite restaurant that served them recently closed. So I am definitely on the lookout for a great Philly cheesesteak in the Tampa Bay area. I heard that I could find it at Jersey Mike's Subs, especially the one in Carrollwood and frankly I was very disappointed with what I received.

The service was fair, nothing to write home about. Pleasant but not trying to sell you additional ingredients or fries,chips, drinks or anything to go with your sandwich. This is bad for the restaurant of course because they're out to make more money and they want the customers to spend more money.

I also am removing a star because I feel the quality in the portion of the food did not meet with the price that I had to pay for my sandwich. I feel the price was too high for the meager amount of toppings I got inside my sandwich. IT  was basically half a sandwich instead of a full sandwich.

Yes, I am disappointed. Yes people continue to rave about Jersey Mike's Subs and tell me to try again. I probably will return and try it one more time but,  I'm not going to make any promises  on that. In the meantime I'm going to be on the lookout for a great new place to go to find my Philly cheesesteak that I so dearly miss.

Pro's:

- Outdoor dining which is COVID friendly.

- Staff were very nice and pleasant.

- The outdoor dining area has games and enough space to enjoy the Florida Lifestyle.

- Food was good enough.


Con's:

- Only able to order through the Mr.Beast App or the website using the QR Code.

- Cups were not in stock yet even though being advertised on the splash page on the website that you have to order through. I understand this isn't their fault as the cups have not been sent to them yet but still a con.

- Food takes a while to be made.

- None of the food was very unique or stand out amongst other burger places.

- Only bottle beverages being sold.


Our Order:

- Chandler Style Burger: Two smashed crispy beef patties with house seasoning, served plain with American cheese on a bun.

- Beast Style Burger: Smashed crispy beef patties with house seasoning, sharp American cheese, pickles, diced white onion, mayo, ketchup, and brown mustard on a soft roll

"Eight months in & Rome & Fig (named after its cross streets) appears to be a restaurant clamoring to find its way, yet apparently popular w/ many. I will return to see if more stars should be awarded, but until then it's THREE for thee. The temperature of multiple food items; the limited menu; the accompanying high prices; & the fragmented decor left much to be desired. 

According to the website, the chef serves up ""elevated classics w/ a modern twist,"" all created in an open kitchen. I only wish he had more of his creations on the menu & they were served @ a desirable temperature.  

The paper dinner menu consists of six appetizers ranging in price from $11 to $16; two soups ($9 ea.); three salads ($8 to $10); added proteins @ $10 - $16 each; seven entrees ($20 to $41) & approximately four desserts (not on the menu). I'm told there's a separate brunch menu. 

We began our six-person food odyssey w/ high hopes & expectations. Our two Creole Style Crab Cakes ($16) were very good, & the Tomato Salad ($10) was average. The Mediterranean Plate ($11) was fine, but uneventful. And although the two, small Bison Meatballs ($14) were flavorful, being served LUKEWARM detracted from their flavor. We were in agreement that the Korean St. Louis Ribs ($15) were worthy--SEE PIC. Only the Tomato Salad lacks a pic. 

Our entrees were the black sheep of the evening. Although the Creamy Risotto ($20) w/ Citrus Chicken (+ $10) was very good, the Risotto ($20) served w/ Scottish Salmon atop (+ $14) was disappointing-- the salmon was LESS THAN WARM. The Lamb Chops + Loin ($34) were very good, except that they too were served LUKEWARM. And the Butter Poached Local Fish of the Day (Black Grouper @ $32) was a major disappointment in three ways-- all three of us received it LUKEWARM, as well as extremely undercooked & almost flavorless. We sent it back to the kitchen. New, well-cooked planks of Black Grouper were brought to our table after our three other companions had already finished their entrées, which dampened the mood. Although the fish was a considerable improvement, it (& the Carrot Ginger Puree it sat upon) had VERY little seasoning-- & hence very little flavor. Salt & pepper was no where to be found on any table. 

Owner (& acting manager) Erik was kind enough to credit all three fish entrées-- a $96 loss to him. However, our rendezvous w/ him was a tad confusing after he appeared at our table, picked up our steak knives, & began to grab our plates without introducing himself first-- to us, he was just some random dude swiping our wares:) Our young male server was very good, & we each made sure to tip on what would have been the full amount had the grouper been present on our checks. 

This restaurant in North Hyde Park has an interesting, unique decor, albeit an identity crisis of sorts. Housed in a new, upscale modern structure, its stark cement floor & exposed piping & ductwork have that raw & unfinished industrial look. Yet, the mismatched chairs & stools w/ gold legs accents offer a mid-century modern vision. And that vision is blurred by shabby chic coastal highlights, two wall TVs, & an astroturf-covered elevated patio complete w/ casual tables under beach umbrellas. Toss in a pricey, yet paper, menu & I am clamoring to discern a cohesive identity. It just isn't there, but a large section of cocktails, red & white wines, & beers are.

Be prepared for the major road work surrounding the restaurant. I'll prepare for a subsequent return to see if the husband & wife duo were able to find their niche in the New American cuisine arena. I'd really love to be able to say I love this restaurant-- fingers crossed! Paying more for great food, I'm down with, but it has got to be served @ an appropriate temperature.",38,C,Rome + Fig,Rome + Fig,Rome + Fig,3.0,NEGATIVE

I went to Maloney's with a group of about 10 people. We ordered food and beers and watched a game on TV while enjoying each others company.

My concern was with the service. No one came over to take away the empty and partially empty warm beer glasses. As a result, one partially filled glass, which had been sitting there a long while, got knocked over. After that, I took some partially-filled warm beers to the bar, which did not prompt any action on the part of the employees to get the rest off the tables. Also, no one came by to ask if we wanted anything more (after a couple of hours of watching the game) and ask if we were ready for the checks. While I understand that the server isn't watching the game, when people start going to the bar to pay up and get their credit cards back (from running a tab), it would be nice for the server to come over and ask the others if they are ready for their bills, too.

I went during the Gasparilla Festival of Arts to grab a bite to eat and I was definitely not disappointed. At first glance at the menu I was taken back at the prices. However, I was able to split my meal and i am so glad I did!  The portions were huge! We split the chicken salad wrap, which came with  a salad. The salad was amazing. I want to go back just for the salad. It was an arugula with shaved Parmesan cheese and an amazing dressing. For our free drinks, we got the rose.

Maybe it's the spirit of the season that's compelled me to write a glowing review of a restaurant in Tampa. Either that or I've had one too many of their deliciously sweet mimosa's this morning.

From the impressive New England/Manhattan chowder to the made to order omelette's and crepes to the deliriously fresh shellfish.

"I was sadly disappointed on my first visit to New York New York Pizza in Carrollwood right after the place opened. And so rather than blast a new restaurant that was trying to get established in the community, I waited for several months and then tried the place again. I should have stuck with my original opinion of this restaurant.

New York New York Pizza is a small Tampa-based chain with outlets in Ybor City, Hyde Park, Riverview, Westchase, Wesley Chapel, and now Carrollwood. This location is in the shopping center at the corner of Dale Mabry and Linebaugh. It's the same shopping center as Publix, Tijuana Flats, Golfer's Grail, and Brass Tap

Their website advertises that they serve slices that are large, wide, thin, and foldable. Their menu also advertises that in addition to pizza, they also serve subs, burgers, wraps, salads, and Italian entrées. That may be the case, but this restaurant is clearly catering to the ""pizza by the slice"" crowd.

On both of my visits I selected slices from the various pies sitting in their display cases. The cashier lifted the slices onto a round, metal pizza pan, moved them to the pizza oven, and then delivered them to the table a minute or two later. That gave you plenty of time to collect your drink, and find an open seat at a nearby table.

The crust was crisp, but I certainly would not call this NY-style thin crust. It was more of a normal thickness, and frankly pretty bland. A little more salt in the pizza dough would have helped immensely. This was not a slice of pizza that you could easily 'fold' lengthwise, but rather a slice that you have to crack the outer rim, and then squeeze it together in order to eat.

The sauce and the cheese seemed to be in the right proportions, but the sauce was also pretty tasteless, and clearly just sauce out of a can. The amount of toppings was great, but that also contributed to my major issue -- the grease. This was a pizza that I wanted to wring out, or at least blot with several napkins before attempting to eat. The grease was overwhelming, and the slice kinda dribbled the whole time that I was trying to eat it. Hardly appetizing.

Several hours after eating a couple of slices, I still had the lingering after-taste of grease in my mouth and belly. A couple of Tums later and I was back to normal. Not a good experience.

I hope that you have a better experience at NY NY Pizzeria than me. I'm very familiar with NY-style thin crust pizza from Little Italy, and this isn't it. Perhaps you'll like it, but I don't plan on ever going back.",18,B,New York New York Pizza - Carrollwood,New York New York Pizza - Carrollwood,New York New York Pizza - Carrollwood Inc.,2.0,NEGATIVE

"Unless requested, I probably won't go back this pizza/Greek joint.  Nothing was ""wrong,"" per se, but life is too short for average pizza.

For the same price, one can travel a quarter mile north or south down the road and get a better pie for the same price.  Granted, Gondolier's menu is expansive as hell and they offer up a ton of options from Greek to pizza to burgers, but I went there for pizza and it fell short of my expectations--Grande cheese or not.",14,B,Gondolier Italian Restaurant & Pizza,Gondolier Italian Restaurant & Pizza,Gondoli3r Italian R3staurant & Pizza,2.0,NEGATIVE

"In my opinion, Red Robin is one of the best burger chains, mainly because the food is so customizeable and because the burgers are not too-thick, too-many-toppings, soggy dripping monstrosities, as the majority of restaurant burgers these days tend to be.

I've only been to this location once, but the service was great and our food came out quickly despite being really busy. 

I don't love the little pay-at-your table kiosks, though--they do make paying and splitting checks with friends super easy and leave servers time to focus on other things, but all the games and ads on there are annoying, and the're always on, so if you don't want to see that out of the corner of your eye you have to stick the thing on the floor til you're ready to use it, which bugs me.

"If I could leave a zero I would. I went with my family wife, twin (2yrs old),10yr daughter. First thing the building itself is pretty ran down was kind of hesitant about decided to give them a fair chance. When we walked in they were acting kind of funny towards us then asked how old my babies were. I said 2 and then one of them said something in a different language and then the other said it will be 3.99 for each baby. So that is 13.99 x3 for the adults and 3.99 x2 for the babies. Mind you my babies are lite eater and did not eat hardly anything from their menu. The server dropped our drinks off and we did not see her again throughout dinner. The food was very basic at best nothing to right home about but not bad. When the server finally brought the check. It was 67.00 apparently they charge 1.99 for each drink and add a standard 12% gratuity to the check. At a normal restaurant gratuity typically does not bother me but we are talking about  a buffet I saw my server once and paid at the front this does not call for a 12 % tip.

"This is the best sushi I've had since leaving CA!.....But let me back up and start from the beginning. 

So I just moved here from the west coast a couple of weeks ago. The wife and I have been wanting sushi but didn't know where to start, as we're both picky and hate spending money to be disappointed. We pass by this spot regularly, since it is right down the street and around a corner. After consulting Yelp to see what the people think, we decided to try here. We were greeted by the ladies inside and allowed to choose a table. This was early Sunday afternoon(with a Bucs game going on down the street at the same time) and the place had a good number of patrons but it wasn't full. The wife had a tofu appetizer and the bulgogi lunch meal(came with veggies, tempura, rice, & kimchi), which was good and plenty of food. She wanted one of their Korean specialty dishes, but that doesn't begin until 2:30 on Sundays. I had 3 of their sushi rolls. One with crab salad inside and white fish outside, and covered with chunks of salmon mixed in their spicy sauce(it was AMAZING). One with shrimp, avocado & cream cheese inside, and tuna & salmon on top(it was good). Then I had some rainbow rolls plus salmon & California rolls for the kid. We did not finish all this because we were full. The total bill pre tip came to $79, which I feel was worth it, and the staff was friendly and attentive.

We will definitely be back, as I want more of that one roll, and I'm curious to try others. The wife could not make up her mind with all the choices, so she wants to come back a few more times(especially for dinner when more Korean selections are available). The little one will just go wherever we take her. This place was good, so YOU should definitely go here!",28,C,Matoi Sushi,Matoi Sushi,M@toi Sushi,4.0,POSITIVE
"Chifa Gino's is a terrific little Peruvian / Chinese fusion restaurant located along Armenia Avenue, about a mile south of Busch Boulevard. The restaurant sits in the middle of a small strip center on a bend in the road, so it's easy to overlook the place unless you're paying attention.

For those who don't know about the Peruvian-Chinese connection, ancient Asian immigrants crossed the Pacific and landed along the coastline of South America. Many of them decided to stay and settle around Lima, Peru, and as a result there is quite the culinary fusion of Peruvian and Chinese ingredients which are prepared according to Cantonese culinary tradition. Chifa is a term used in Peru and Ecuador to refer to this style of Chinese cooking. Peruvian chefs use products which are popular in traditional Chinese cooking such as ginger, soy sauce, scallions, and a variety of other ingredients like wontons, fried rice (chaufa), and sweet and sour sauce, as a part of their daily cuisine.

One of the most popular dishes of this style is called Arroz chaufa, which is Cantonese-Peruvian style fried rice (white rice, soy sauce, scallions, fried egg, and meat such as chicken or pork). You'll also see a lot of Chow Mein noodle dishes, Wonton soup, and Egg Drop soups on the menus.

I was there for lunch today, and ordered a bowl of Wonton soup to start. The soup was fantastic, and not as salty as traditional Wonton soup in Asian restaurants. From the lunchtime specials menu I also ordered the Pollo Saltado, which a chicken stir-fry made with well-seasoned chicken strips sautéed with tomatoes and onions, served over French fries, with a scoop of white rice on the side. Very delicious, and quite the bargain at $7.99.

If you're feeling a little adventurous, and you're in the Armenia Avenue area at lunchtime, then I highly recommend at stop at Chifa Gino to try something new.",12,A,Chifa Gino's,Chifa Gino's,chifa gino's,4.0,POSITIVE

"Sadly, I have to update my review. 

A few weeks ago, I gave this restaurant a whopping 4 stars after hosting a business dinner there with a few colleagues. I truly thought this place was a gem--so much so that decided to host my birthday dinner there, last night. 

I was there with a group of 13 girlfriends. From the moment we got there, the vibe and service seemed a bit off (mind you, it wasnt busy. It was a wednesday night, the place was pretty empty)... Some of the ladies started at the bar. On Wednesdays, they have a $10 wine special. Many of the ladies were told they could no longer get their drinks since they joined the table. It was an unnecessary inconvenience especially gven how empty the restaurant was. Important to note,  i reserved the same lounge for my business meeting (also on a weds) and the waiter/bartenders were happy to accomodate. 

We only had 1 server throughout the night which made things very slow. One of my guests did not like her appetizer, and they gave her a huge unnecessary fit just to swap it out. The mgr (Chris) still charged her for it, and only agreed to remove it from her bill on the condition that she leave the restaurant  (Whaat??). 

It took forever to get the checks. (Again empty on a Weds night). The service just seemed so cold. I tried to stay optimistic since it was my birthday, but it was so disappointing :( ... when it was time to pay, several of my guests discussed their concerns with service not measuring up to the gratuity, and they pretty much got a ""Sorry, not sorry."" Chris, the mgr, even threatened to call the police when one of my guests expressed she was not comfortable paying the tip (bizarre!!). 

Apparently Chris, the manager, also made the comment that he felt our table was expecting happy hours prices and snacks and that's not the restaurant ""caliber"" Grille One Sixteen is... almost to suggest that we couldn't afford the place?

"This is a fine spot to grab a burger while shopping at the International Plaza...but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here for a bite. Located in the food court of International Plaza near Chipotle, Johnny Rockets is a walk-up and order style counter serving up burgers, fries, and a handful of other items (probably a bit more limited than what you might find at an actual Johnny Rockets restaurant).   

I had the Rocket Single which came with cheese and NO condiments. They will provide ketchup packets as well as mayo packets but I was told that they do not have mustard (which may have just been on that particular day, but a bit off-putting none-the-less). The fries were just so-so; I didn't even finish them and I ALWAYS finish my fries within minutes.

I saw what appeared to be a crowd of people waiting for their orders, so I became worried that it might take a while for mine. When I asked how long it would be before my order was ready, the employee said probably about 5-10 minutes. He was right - my order was up in about 10 minutes or slightly less, but when I got my food, there were still tons of people that had been waiting since before me.

"My girlfriend is an avid fan of Turkish food so we tried the new restaurant Shish Kebab and Turkish Cuisine on West Hillsoborogh last night. We were both pretty hopeful that we had found a new hidden gem so that we could have a new local spot to go to quite often. We left somewhat disappointed. Perhaps they are still working out the kinks, since they only opened a month ago, or maybe it was just the night that we were there but the service was definitely a bit off and there were some quirks with several of the dishes that we ordered as well. 

We started with a couple appetizers in the Shepard Salad and the Babaganush. I would say both were okay but not great. The Shepard Salad was not served based on the description that was listed on the menu having left off a few of the ingredients. We could tell and it just seemed like it needed something else. 

For entree's we ordered the Doner Kebab and a Chicken Shish Kebab. Both were good but not great. To be more specific ... items that were to be served with the Chicken Shish Kebab's didnt come out and we had to ask for them specifically (then actually pull out the menu to point out to the server that there indeed was a problem). By the time these items were brought out it was near the end of our dinner so we were getting full. The Doner Kebab was good but I'd say a little more than 1/2 the lamb served was overdone and char grilled / crunchy. This effected the outcome of this dish greatly. 

Overall, our experience at this new Turkish restaurant was a little bit bumpy but because my girl is such a big fan of Turkish food, we'll definitely give this local establishment another shot. All the problems or bumps we saw are definitely fixable things and like a mentioned in the opening ... hopefully they were a product of just having opened not long ago.

Service spot on! Only reason I am giving them a 3 star is I only had Tacos...very good food, very impressed and we are going back this coming week for sure. I have a gut feeling this place is going to do very well...let's get some good caso dipp for those chips we will pay for that...will let you know how it goes next week.
SECOND VISIT: Friday 11/11. My son had shrimp and look like potatoes he commented it was overpriced with only a few shrimp. I decided I would try what appears to be a specialty. Filet mignon bubbly??? Onions, red pepper, etc along with soft flour tortilla....MISTAKE....comes to the table in a volcanic looking bowl with about 7-8 chunks of filet BOILED like a soup. That is what it was a Soup who does that to filet mignon..horrible don't get this it is really REALLY bad.  May or may not go back, only thing they having going so far is taco. 

12/1/16..sorry but I don't believe a restaurant can stay in business on Taco a lone! Was really pulling for this place...Next!

"Love this place! Found it by looking up coffee shops in South Tampa and have been going ever since! 
We started going there shortly after it opened and have watched the menu expand, along with the staff. The service was fairly slow a couple of the times we went with big groups due to the lack of staff, but it seems to have changed. 
We visited just this morning and enjoyed our favorite cappuccinos! We also shared an egg, pancake, and bacon breakfast that is simple but filing. 
My actual favorite menu item is the Beansy - beans, egg, sausage, peppers, and provolone on bread - delicious! I almost always order it.

"One of my vendor partners invited me for a Holiday luncheon today at the Centre Club, and I was delighted to accept since I hadn't been to the club in about a year.

The Centre Club is a swanky business networking club perched atop the 8th floor parking deck for the Urban Centre towers at the intersection of Westshore Blvd and Kennedy Blvd. To get to the club you need to pull into the parking garage located behind the InterContinental Hotel (and Shula's Steakhouse). Follow the signs behind the building and then circle your way through the parking garage until you see the signs for the Centre Club. From there you take the elevator up to the Club level.

You're greeted at the desk by the ladies who check your membership status, or have you wait until the member arrives. From there we walked into Bentley's Lounge for a drink and a chance to catch up. The lounge is designed as a work space and relaxing location for the influential business professionals and community leaders of the Westshore district. Since there is free WiFi in the lounge, I saw many business associates plunking away on their laptops and tablets, and had the chance to network with a few people before we walked into the main Skyline dining room for lunch.

The entire club has a spectacular, unobstructed view of Tampa Bay as well as the downtown area, and it's hard not to pause and say ""Oh wow!"" if you've never been here before. The dining room is very elegant with white tablecloths and top-notch service. The server greeted my business associate by name, and quickly took our drink orders and made some recommendations for lunch.

I had the Blackened Salmon salad which was a nice piece of blackened filet sitting atop baby spinach, heirloom tomatoes, mandarin oranges, almond slivers, and dressed with crispy onion strips and a sesame dressing. It was quite delicious, and nice and light for a business lunch. 

Since this is a private membership club, all of the end-of-meal check issues are handled very discretely. The server simply brings the bill to the member who signs their name, and then they receive a bill at the end of the month for all food & beverage expenses. 

I've been to the club many times in the past, and attended a variety of meetings held in their various conference rooms. If you are a professional business person who is looking for an elegant location to network with business associates, and enjoy some fine dining then the Centre Club might be right for you.",39,C,Centre Club - Tampa,Centre Club - Tampa,C3ntr3 Club - Tampa,4.0,POSITIVE

"It would be real easy to drive right past this little lunch counter / café located along Waters Avenue, about a half mile east of Sheldon Road, and that would be a terrible shame. The Caribbean Sandwich Shop is tucked inside one of a series of little ethnic shopping strips -- in between a tattoo parlor and a drive-through beer barn. Don't be put off by the neighborhood since this place is serving up some very delicious breakfast and lunch options to their loyal customers.

I was out in NW Hillsborough running a series of errands, and checked through my Yelp bookmarks to see what looked interesting. The reviews were absolutely on target about the terrific food being served up at the Caribbean Sandwich Shop which is run by a father - son combo from Puerto Rico.

I'm not sure if they actually have a printed menu, since most people come in and order one of the specials from the wipe-off board from behind the counter. In the tradition of a great short-order diner, they just ask for whatever they want, and minutes later the food is delivered to the front counter.

The big painted window mural talks about their Cuban sandwiches, so I had that on my mind as I walked through the front door. I looked up on the Specials board to see what looked tasty. The fellow behind the counter told me that today's big seller was a pressed pastrami sandwich, made in the style of a Cuban with thinly sliced meat, grilled onions, cheese, lettuce and mustard all pressed on a Cuban roll. Add a can of Diet Coke to my order, and the whole thing was about $7. SCORE!!!!

There was a steady stream of lunchtime regulars who were either sitting at one of the tables, or carrying out their bags of deliciousness. The guys behind the counter seemed to know everyone by name, and also seemed to know everyone's ""usual"" order. That kind of loyal customer base is a great sign.

I see that the Caribbean Sandwich Shop also features a meatloaf sandwich for lunch, so I need to go back and check that out in the near future.

"It would seem that Flippers began in Orlando, but I never visited one while I lived there.  We had heard good things about this place and were pleased to find they offer their lunch specials on the weekends as well.  Flippers has some unusual pizza options and as a lover of some of the out-there veggies like artichoke hearts and roasted red peppers, I was thrilled.  We went with two MyPie size specialty pizzas but were starving so ordered the Mozz Caprese salad as well.  The mozz was nothing amazing but was creamy and nicely cold.  The tomatoes and arugula were perfect but the real star was the high quality balsamic drizzled around the plate along with a decent quality olive oil.  

The salad kept us from trying to eat the table and the 15-20 minutes for our pizza passed quickly (props to our server for mentioning that they were slammed and pizzas were taking a little longer than usual).  We went with the Flippers Big Pie (just about every meat you could want plus red onions, black olives, mushrooms and green peppers) and were happy they were able to sub roasted red peppers for the standard green ones.  We also ordered the California Classic (artichoke hearts, roasted grape tomatoes, red onions, spinach and roasted red peppers) but asked for red sauce rather than the basil pesto sauce.  Both pizzas were piping hot and covered in toppings.  My favorite part of the Big Pie was that somehow they managed to get the pepperonis up on their sides so they got nice and crispy in the oven.  The California Classic was fabulous and the veggies tasted super fresh.  My husband is not a fan of crusts but part way through his first slice, he decided I wasn't getting any extra crusts that day.  He ate every bite himself and we were both really impressed with how good the crust tasted.  

Our dining experience was good - the restaurant was clean and comfortable, with a really great music mix playing I was digging.  The service was very good - our drinks always kept full and our server was there when we needed him.  The only thing I would change was the number of slices on the My Pie size.  The pizzas come sliced into 4 slices, but I think I would prefer 6 slices when sharing like we were.  The 4-slice method resulted in some monster slices.  Overall - GREAT experience and really outstanding pizza.  We will absolutely be back!",25,B,Flippers Pizzeria,Flippers Pizzeria,Flippers Pizzeria,5.0,POSITIVE

"I will not be back - over priced and sub-par sushi. I was initially excited for a sushi place to be added in this area, and of course expected it to be pricier just based on location. There were 3 of us in my party and our bill was over $125 for a few sushi rolls and sake flights. 

The entire experience was awkward. I know they just recently opened, but it seemed like none of the staff understood what was going on. Don't try to sub out a sake on the sake flight.... that seemed to confuse everybody working there. We ordered the potstickers for an app and those were actually pretty good. 

When it was time for our sushi to come out, the waiter started clearing a space in the middle saying that it was a large boat. Then ""oh wait, never mind, that was somebody else's sushi."" It was prob another 20 mins after that before we actually got our sushi. The place was not very busy, so the wait seemed a bit long. Then the waiter actually asked us to move tables because the sushi boat would not fit on the table we were at. We would've been fine with plates, but moved so as not to confuse them anymore. 

When they brought the ridiculously large boat out, they set it down on a diagonal, so it was awkward to sit. We had to instruct them to turn it so it was not poking us. Then when the two waiters came to take the boat away, they lifted it directly over my head! That was a little thing, but completely inappropriate to lift something like that over your head. 

I've never seen 3 people leave so much sushi uneaten. Not because we were full. We were all pretty hungry still, but it wasn't even worth eating. 

Maybe try some of their Thai dishes, but steer clear of the sushi. The Thai dishes looked good, but we're also pricey and there are some pretty good other Thai restaurants in Tampa I would recommend over Thai Prime.

"We were looking for a good seafood restaurant in Tampa area and came across the Seabreeze Trolley. What a pleasant surprise. When you pull up, it doesn't look like much, but in this case looks are most deceiving. Our first day here we ordered the soft shell crabs which turned out to be the best my son and I have ever had. The owner catches them himself and keeps them until the shell is perfect. Not one part of the crab was chewy. A close second is their deviled crab which is an old family recipe that is folklore. The fried shrimp and Cajun shrimp are also excellent. The service is also great. We went here three of the 4 days we were here for lunch; on the second day they did not have any soft shells. So we came back today and ordered a soft shell sandwich, the woman that waited on us previously, welcomed us and said she would deliver our order to our minivan.

When you order online; there is not an option to add extra dipping sauce. So I call and let them know and offer to pay for them, I have no problem lying I just can't order them. 
The first time they did not put any in the bag.

The third time (delivery this time), I put it in the comment section AND called to request the ranch. I was told I had to add it and explained there is no option. She said she can only give me three, I said I'll take what you give me. Well I took none, upon delivery there were Zero dipping sauces.

"There are some good and not so good here. I will start with the good. There was a great beer selection. They also carried meads and ciders which is a plus for me. The crowd was friendly. The cheese on the cheese tray was good. The truffle fries were great. The negatives... ordering at the bar was chaos. My wife stood for 15 mins and no one took her order. I finally went up an started waving my hands and hollering for help. We ordered 20mins after our friends. Their food came out 15 mins after ours. If you want another drink, good luck making your way back to the bar when it's busy. The cheese tray came with tiny pieces of crumbled bread. This wasn't ideal for eating with cheese. The menu said it came with fruit but there was only 2 small slices of star fruit. My friends enjoyed the grilled cheese. In short, it would be super if they had just a little table service....at least  drink refills. I would also tweek the cheese tray situation.

"This place was alright.  Came here hoping to order something a fellow yelper had mentioned about but when I asked about it, the waitress gave me a look like I ordered burger and fries.  She wsn't rude or anything, I think she just had no idea what I was talking about and she did ask the kitchen and told us they don't have it anymore.  So service was good, we had few dishes changed to vegetarian version and they didn't mind doing it even when we got a different waiter to place a last minute to go order at the end of the meal.

I had one of the vegetarian dishes, ordered panang and instead of meat they replaced it with tofu.  I'm not sure if changing it to tofu made a difference, but the taste of the curry wasn't too strong instead i just tasted alot of spiciness.  Even though the curry taste wasn't strong enough for me, it did taste good if you mix it up with the rice they gave you.  By mixing I mean just the curry sauce and rice and none of the veggies.  The rice I got was something I wasn't expecting, I thought it would be white rice but it looked a little bit like fried rice with eggs.

For now I'm giving it 3 because I'm not sure if having their dishes modified with tofu changed the taste.  So chances are I will be going back and tasting their dishes the way they're suppose to be.",23,B,Sukhothai Restaurant,Sukhothai Restaurant,Sukhothai R3staurant,3.0,POSITIVE

"Beautifully décored restaurant that scores high marks on their handcrafted drinks, tapas/appetizers and desserts, but fails to deliver on their entrees. Service was excellent.

Moscow mule- absolutely delicious! Extra spicy because they use their homemade ginger juice. Does not have a fiz to it. 5/5

Smokey Joe's- did not have it with the rum so it was pretty much an old fashioned that was beautifully delivered in a wooden smoked box. Delicious!! 5/5

Cakebread Cellars Cabarnet Sauvignon wine- this one was ok, but everyone had different tastes going on with it but it was mutually agreed that their was an aftertaste that was bitter. 3/5

Agua Chili Ceviche- absolutely phenomenal and delicious ceviche that hit the tangy notes while being spicy yet fresh! 5/5

Oxtail Fritters- absolutely the best appetizer that we had that night. Was served on top of bone marrow and everything about this dish was delicious. Crispy outside and a fatty yet meaty sauce inside. 5/5

Sweet Corn fritters- crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside and served with a delicious tangy ranch. 4/5

24 oz ""Dirty Bone"" Tomahawk Ribeye- was sorely disappointed in this steak. Nothing special about it. The crust was excessively salty and the inside was a bit chewy. We got it medium rare. If you want this, order it at the beginning because it takes 20 min to get. This was overly priced. 3/5

Borracho Chicken- chicken was tender but I could barely eat it because the sauce was way too salty. 2/5

Pappardelle Pasta- it was a decent pasta. The papparadelle is too thin and is even thinner than linguine, but the pasta tasted fresh. The sauce did not have much flavour. 3/5

Steak fries- above average fries but the real show stopper was the garlic aioli. So much better than the tomato marmalade. 4/5

Kale with hazelnuts and cranberries- this was great and there was a brown butter that was mixed with it. It was served hot. The toasted hazelnuts made this delicious and the cranberries added a nice sweetness to it.

Shock-alate Parfait- this was sooooo good! It was 3 different levels of chocolate with this really delicious milky foam and a rich vanilla ice cream. I could have had a second one if I wasn't so full. 5/5",23,B,Flor Fina,Flor Fina,Flor Fin@,4.0,NEGATIVE

"Not one for publicly speaking like this about a restaurant, but we emailed them after our experience to air these (mild) grievances to no response, so here it goes...

Had really high hopes for this place, but left pretty disappointed.  We walk in and the bartender/waitress goes ""Oh, you guys just missed Happy Hour, but we still have our other pitcher special going.""   Why would you tell a customer they just missed happy hour?  Not a big deal, but ok.

Then the menus come out printed on stapled-together computer paper, which is fine, they're just getting started, but with the tiniest font I think Microsoft Word allows.  I don't even wear glasses and had to squint to read the thing.  

Wings come in 6, 12, and like, 24 if I remember right.  Why such odd increments?  10 is perfect, but now you've gotta choose 6 (too little) or 12 (a little too much).

Pulled Pork won tons sound pretty appetizing, but were a disappointment boasting bland fried shells, stuffed with a nibble of unremarkable bbq pulled pork you could probably get in a tub at Publix.

The wings are definitely as huge as they advertise them, which is a plus, but the angry elephant sauce I got on mine was horrid.  I've had my fair share of ""hot"" wing sauces, but, in addition to being bathed in this deep, thick red concoction (very odd color for wing sauce), the sauce boasted a flavor that was so unsubtle and just stupidly hot, I found myself just wiping it off each wing with a napkin.  Listen, there's such a thing as as hot AND flavorful.  These wings sadly lacked the latter, a lot. 

Oh yeah, napkins.  We had to ask for those.  At a wing place.  After we'd gotten our wings.  I know places make a few rookie mistakes here and there, but come on.

"I'm sitting here with a big party of my friends. They had their own issues but mine was the worst. I ordered a 1/2 pasta dish with salad being told its two halfs and a half salad. Since that's a lot of food and our waitress seemed confused I decided to share with a friend and be on their tab till we pay and I'll pay my half with my card as to not make things complicated. She then came out to tell me its only one half portion and a half salad. So I said OK I'll be on my own tab now and just eat that myself. She then triples""oh so you don't want anything? "" I don't understand where all the confusion came from. .. so I decided to just start over since it was getting silly. I've waitressed for years I can understand that happens sometimes. I then tell her exactly what I want and she leaves. I get my food and it's clearly a different pasta dish then what I ordered. So I ask her what it was and she seemed more confused. I then tell her my order again and she said I'm sorry I'll get it fixed. So OK that's fine. .. she apologized and it was getting fixed. When she brought it out. ...like I said I've waitressed for a lot of years. ... the dish was the same noodles from the mistake dish just shaken in the new cheese it was supposed to be. And I've been sitting here trying to pay my tab for a good 30 mins after the confusion of the check split and having to wait for that.

"I was very disappointed in my dinner her last week. One of the main reasons why we came here, was so we had the option for sushi - however once we sat down, we found out that the sushi menu was pulled due to the fact that the place was so slammed. So, since I was trying to be good - I opted for the chopped salad that was supposed to be packed with veggies, chicken, and cheese. There was bacon on the salad too - but I didn't want it - so I asked them to hold the bacon. Of course when the salad came out - it was not chopped, not full of veggies, the chicken was extremely dry, not a lot of cheese, and had bacon. The other kicker was that it had such little salad dressing on it, that I had to choke it down. Such a sad dinner.",14,B,Jacksons Bistro Bar & Sushi,Jacksons Bistro Bar & Sushi,Jacksons Bistro Bar & Sushi,2.0,NEGATIVE

"Fruitwood Standup Market is a hidden gem in South Tampa. The restaurant is very small and there's only outdoor seating, but everything is reasonably priced and full of flavor. The restaurant has a really cool beach-vibe, it's supposed to look like an old surf shop and there's bumper stickers everywhere. You actually order inside and pick up your order at the outside window.

My go-tos are their salads, they're amazing and surprisingly filling. I usually do the Paddleboard Power Salad and add chicken. Their Kale Caesar Gulf Shrimp salad is yummy too. I've also tried a couple of their flatbreads, you can't go wrong either way. Last time I got the Spicy Chipotle Cheddar flatbread and it was very tasty.

"The first thing I have to say is that this place is hard to find. We drove twice by it, because we were looking for Cilantro, but they changed the name and erm... yea. 

I'm starting to feel a deja vous coming. We went to this restaurant on a Sunday, two weeks ago, and they were also serving a buffet. No idea if this is the norm here in Tampa but it's extremely disappointing to walk in a restaurant and seeing that there is a buffet. Luckily, I was able to order a la carte. 

However, even if it was lucky because I was dying for the Lamb Rogan Josh, the service was so bad that my dish arrived when everyone in my party was either done or having their desserts. 

The hostess sat us promptly and took our orders of Mango Lassi. It was really delicious, the best one I've had in the States so far. After that, as most people in my party opted for the buffet, I went in search of the hostess as she took the orders as well, to let her know that I already knew what I wanted. Then she told me that she couldn't take my order. I had to wait for the gentleman who was in the kitchen to come and take my order. 

I waited... and then I waited some more until he finally came to see me. By this time everyone at the table was eating. After ordering, it took another ridiculous amount of time for the food to be served. 

We used to order food from this restaurant when it was called Cilantro's, unfortunately after this visit, I don't think we'll return as the food is not the same quality as it used to be and quite frankly, I don't like to have to wait almost 40 min for food.",5,A,Dhaniya Drums Indian Food,Dhaniya Drums Indian Food,Dh@niy@ Drums Indi@n Food,2.0,NEGATIVE

"Generally pleasant service, but seemingly has some technical/precedural issues.

I've eaten at this location on a fairly regular basis over the past half-year or so, and had been a customer of other Bob Evans in the past. On the whole, this location typifies the Bob Evans experience: the building is well-maintained both inside and out, the mood is calm and conducive to socializing with your party, the service is mostly friendly and competent, and the food is of acceptable quality--so long as you're willing to deal with a bit of quirkiness due to some . . . interesting managerial decisions.

When you eat here, I recommend asking for Jennifer or Nick as your server on weeknights or Madison on the weekend. They each offer well-above-average service and enjoyable personalities. I've rarely had a bad server at this location, and the managers are polite, as well.

As for the ""quirky"" management decisions, for one they have a tendency to clump customers together in the dining room, rather than spacing them apart, even when the restaurant is less than half full. I'm sure the reason has something to do with minimizing the amount of walking the staff need to do, and I can appreciate that, but I feel they could find a way to do so without cramming the customers together quite so tightly. As an example of why this is a bad idea, I offer my experince from tonight: the manager, Judy, sat a family of four at the table directly behind me then, in the process of attempting to put a booster seat at the table, hit me in the shoulder with it a couple of times. I wasn't hurt and she apologized immediately, but it was definitely not pleasant and there were eight other empty tables at which the family could have been seated that would have avoided the situation altogether. At the least, Judy could have warned me what she was about to do so I could get myself out of the way.

The kitchen likewise has issues, although the waitstaff seem aware of them, and work hard to shield the customers as much as possible. As has been mentioned by other Yelp reviewers, the kitchen seems to run out of items on a regular basis--the family of four mentioned above attempted to order mac-n-cheese for their children, only to be told it wasn't available. 

The cooks seem technically competent, as the food is generally moist, flavorful, and appealing in presentation, but there, too, they have certain procedural issues. An example of that is with their current heavily-promoted special, a Brioch French toast with blueberry topping, which has quickly become a favorite of mine. The French toast itself has always been perfectly prepared, golden-brown and just chewy enough to feel good in the mouth. However, the kitchen's policy is to pull the blueberry topping directly from the refrigerator and pour it over the the piping hot toast. Needless to say, the combination of hot toast and 40-degree-cold berries leaves you with a plate of unappitizing, luke-warm food. The servers I've spoken with have noted a number of customers complaining about it, and usually recommend the customers ask for the topping to be warmed prior to serving, but it is up to the customer to actually make the request. 

I also questioned one of the managers--I didn't catch the name on her tag, unfortunately--and she advised me it is necessary for food ingredients to be kept at or below 40 degrees per law, and there was nothing they could do about that, which seems like a non-answer to me. After all, the sausage I ordered as a side-item to my meal would likewise have been kept at such temperatures, but was heated as a matter of course before being served to me. Why should a customer need to make a special request to not be served a lukewarm dish? I count this as another odd management decision.

Quirks aside, I do recommend this location if you're looking for a place to have a pleasant meal and good conversation with friends or family, just don't be afraid to tell your server exactly what you want. And remember to tip well! :-)",9,A,Bob Evans,Bob Evans,Bob Evans,4.0,POSITIVE
"Will definitely return to try other items on the menu.  I ordered the shrimp and grits, although they were a little lumpy and could've use a bit more moisture, the flavors were good.

"Casa Mexicana is the definition of a hidden gem. I was driving around aimlessly after visiting the Thai temple when I noticed a Mexican restaurant in a run down plaza appropriately named International Mini Mall on Palm River Rd. The following day I decided to go there for lunch. 

From the moment I pulled up to the restaurant, I felt like I was transported to Mexico. There's a Mexican market called Los Nopales next to it and posters on the window advertising various local Mexican concerts. I walked into the restaurant and was pleasantly surprised at the size of the restaurant. It is divided into two sections, the front section near the kitchen has about 5 tables and the dimly lit back area has many tables spread out, with a jukebox playing Mexican music, of course. It appears that this area is used for dances, live music, televised boxing events, etc. I decided to sit in the front where a few other patrons were sitting. When in Mexico, do as the Mexicans do...

I was greeted with a nice smile by my waitress who spoke to me in Spanish, which is commonplace for me although I'm not Latino. Fortunately, my Spanish is above average so there weren't any problems with ordering but I think she also spoke English. I was still in awe as she handed me a menu which looked professionally designed and had items for breakfast and lunch. A moment later she brought me chips and salsa (complimentary). 

I ordered the horchata, which was probably the best I've had anywhere (as good as TacoSon's horchata). The horchata had great flavor and you know how some horchata tastes kinda sandy?(like at Taco Bus)...the horchata here was nice and smooth. 

Since most people go to Mexican restaurants for tacos and no one else has Yelp-reviewed this restaurant, I felt obligated to order tacos. I got one carnitas, one chicken and one steak. It was nice sitting by the kitchen so I can watch my meal being cooked. In about 10 minutes, they were ready.  The wax paper underneath the tacos was a good sign that this could get messy. Sure enough, I took a bite of the carnitas taco and the grease oozed out as well as the some of the toppings.  They really fill up the tacos!  The carnitas taco was sooo good! The star of the show. The steak taco was also very good.  The chicken taco was ok. It was my least favorite, it didn't have as much flavor as the carnitas. 

Definitely one of the most authentic restaurants in Tampa. Are they the best tacos in Tampa? I think they are very strong contenders...I can't wait to go back again to see if they're as good the second time around and also try other items, such as breakfast.",40,C,Casa Mexicana,Casa Mexicana,casa mexicana,5.0,POSITIVE

"I felt a bit guilty for not continuing my best Cuban hunt last night, so this morning I decided to ask the folks at the Caribbean Sandwich shop if it was too early for a Cuban. The owner looked at me kinda odd, like ""huh?"". He started saying he didn't have pork this early in the morning, but then pipes up ""hang on, I think I may have some in the back"".

I love these guys. 

These guys are from Puerto Rico. They run a small but awesome little sandwich shop in a tiny little strip mall on Waters Avenue.  It's not much to look at, but looks can be deceiving.  They certainly are in this case.

If you are familiar with Puerto Rican cuisine, you know what a ""sancocho"" is.  Come and try it here.  It's only on Saturdays, and it's gone by 11am, so come early. 

So, how do these Puerto Ricans fare with a Cuban?

One word: outstanding.  

The trick is the bread and the pork, and on both counts they scored. The pork to ham ratio was still low by my standards, but closer to 2:1, which is a lot better than most other Cubans I've had lately.  And the pork was juicy and flavorful, the way pork should be.  Sorry Boar's Head, your pork doesn't even come close. 

I'd give this place 4.5 stars, but I pushed it to five for two reasons.  First, they are from Puerto Rico.  That counts in my book.  But second, the owner's willingness to accommodate my request show the pride they take in their business, and that's good for a 5th star any day.  I recommend them highly.

We got 3 different pastries, a cranberry, chocolate and ube (which is purple yam in case ya didn't know like me).  Pastries are pretty big sizes, great for sharing and even then it's easy to get full from them. 
My favorite was the Cranberry pastry, for some reason I think this would have gone great with coffee.  But I couldn't pass up getting taro milk tea with boba, my favorite drink and something I just gotta try in any establishment if they offer it.  This was very sweet and they did a good job of mixing it and making it smooth, it was not powdery like some other places.  
Also got the Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich, which was actually a bit too much food, as I was already a bit full from the 3 half pastries I shared with my friend.  The sandwich was still great tasting, you get huge piece of chicken breast hanging out over the edge of the buns, it's fresh, hot (temperature) and crunchy when they bring it out.

"I love PIZZA! PIZZA! And I love the Hot & Ready deal. $5 for a pizza and you don't have to call ahead, that's what I call convenience!

This is my favorite Little Caesars in the Tampa Bay Area. First, the staff had great customer service. Friendly with warm smiles. It was hard to say no when they asked if I wanted to upgrade to the meal (with crazy bread and a 2 liter). In a act, it was so hard that I said yes! 

This location is conveniently located on the corner of a strip mall. There is lots of parking and the inside of the store is bigger than most other Little Caesars in the area. This store is a perfect example of what Little Caesars does right.

For some time, I have had fun calling the Hot & Ready Pizzas Hot & Sweaty Pizzas. I would have probably given this location 5 stars had it not been for the fact my last pizza was a bit more sweaty than ready. It seemed a bit under cooked. Nevertheless, whenever your get the awesome deal called Hot & Ready, there is always some risk of hit of miss. 

I will keep coming back to this location for the clean and large store and great customer service. Surely there will be a few more misses (sweaty pizzas), but I hope for a greater percentage of hits (ready pizzas). And remember, even if the pizza is a bit sweaty, it will always taste better than a frozen pizza you cook in your oven, and if you have seen prices at the grocery store for frozen pizzas, many of them will cost you a lot more than just picking up a Hot & Ready at your local Little Caesars.",6,A,Little Caesars Pizza,Little Caesars Pizza,Littl3 Ca3sars Pizza,4.0,POSITIVE

We ordered the two piece catfish dinner with collard greens and mac and cheese. The catfish was delicious with its fried, cornmeal covered  crunchiness!  The mac and cheese was okay.  Aunt B's turkey wings were topped with Mr. B's signature gravy. The turkey wings were tasty.  We also ordered Mama B's quarter chicken fried and peach cobbler. The Fried Chicken was delicious! It was crispy on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside. The peach cobbler was...weeellll... disappointing. Don't get me wrong,  we weren't expecting my Granny's yummy southern deliciousness (no body makes peach cobbler like granny), but we were expecting some peaches.  There were these very tiny bits of peaches and the rest was syrup and crust like it was scraped from the bottom of an empty pan. That was just disappointing! 

The meals come with a choice of white or yellow rice, two sides, and hot, honey, cornbread. The yellow rice was okay. We're not sure what the  cornbread tasted like. When we got home and started eating our meal, you guessed it... no cornbread.  We were so disappointed. When we called them to find out ""what had happened,"" the nice,  young lady that answered the phone said the cornbread had just gotten out of the oven a few minutes before I called. Yeah,  they probably should have told us that before we left. We would have waited out in the car for some nice, hot, honey cornbread.  

I'll chalk up the mistakes to general weariness due to the covid-19 pandemic. I'm willing to give them another try :-)",2,A,Mr B's Cafe,Mr B's Cafe,Mr B's Cafe Inc.,3.0,POSITIVE
"SUPERB Service here.

I can't believe the great service at an airport restaurant. We went in for a pre flight drink and was greeted by a super friendly staff. They had a nice selection of beers and an appropriate glass to match. Stella for stellas, tall boys for the german beer, amazing. 

I didn't eat (as I was too busy drinking my flight fears away) but people next to us were having both breakfast and lunch and it looked good.

What's really cool is you can sit in the airside outside the restaurant, plug in your laptap and do your work and order food ""to go"" which they bring out hot and fresh to you.

Amazing service. Thanks for making a difficult time so much easier",37,C,Sam Snead's Grill and Tavern,Sam Snead's Grill and Tavern,Sam Snead's Grill and Tavern Inc.,4.0,POSITIVE

"Located in the lobby of the Grand Hyatt this is a relaxing and charming dining option. A comfortable blend of being able to people watch, yet having its own space. Best of all the food was delicious.

Pro: Can't beat the location if you are staying at the Grand Hyatt, it's an elevator ride away. The food is superb and served by an efficient and friendly staff. Great location for people watching.

Con: Prices are marked up due to having a captive customer base. Which I feel is a common practice among such establishments. The restaurant has a very open floor plan, if you prefer a private setting.

After a long day of exploring Tampa, my partner and I were tired but also hungry. The struggle was real and thoughts of venturing beyond the Grand Hyatt were exhausting. After lustfully staring at the in room menu for longer than necessary I decided 1823 Kitchen and Bar was a suitable option. Minutes later around 9pm we seated ourselves at a quaint out of the way high top table in the corner. One of the friendly bartenders arrived at our table guessing correctly that we were looking for a bite to eat. Now with menu in hand I noticed some differences from the in room menu. I opted for the Mojo Pork Quesadilla with peach salsa and sour cream ($12). This dish had excellent mouth feel with a crispy exterior and moist, flavorful meat inside. Paired with a peach salsa and sour cream this created a pleasant flavor experience. What dining experience could be considered complete without dessert, for that I chose Tres Leches Cake. A lactose intolerant nightmare that I thoroughly enjoyed. By this time of night the restaurant is by no means crowded so I didn't feel rushed in the least bit, however I was satisfied to meander back to my room and settled in for the nights sleep. I highly recommend dining here at least once if you're staying at the Grand Hyatt, it has wonderful food and a peaceful atmosphere.",37,C,1823 Kitchen & Bar,1823 Kitchen & Bar,1823 Kitchen & Bar,5.0,POSITIVE

Every time I go there it is clean and organized. The owner is such a sweetheart. They also have a to go menu and they even offered me a call ahead to have it ready since they know I am always in a rush during the week.

Don't even get me started on how tight the knot was on the bag in which i decided to wait till I got home to open. When I opened the bag I found out that my order of crab raccoons were missing, which in my opinion is ridiculous to pay almost $9 for 6 little barely filled stuffed wontons. 

I called and was polite about the situation. I understand things happen and told them what was missing.  Girl on the phone had an attitude and Said that she put it in the bag. I assured her it wasn't in the bag at all and she refused to acknowledge the mistake. Said if I wanted it to come get it in a rude voice. At $9 damn right I'm going to drive even if it's 15 mins away, even if im working night shifts and on top doing a second trip. Do you get my frustration... 

When I get there they didn't even put the order in or tried to apologize. She just gave me a look and made a snarky comment.

"Boss Bitch, you rock!! After a day if traveling and a delayed flight, I arrived to Tampa exhausted and hangry. I am gluten free so as always my options are limited for delivery. And then the holy gods shined down upon the Postmates app and showed me this unicorn called Boss Bitch Pizza.

BBP is a 100% delivery pizza joint, meaning you cant pickup, in fact they dont even share their location.  Hey whatever, I dont care! Their pizza is 100% gluten free and cauliflower crust, yes yes yes!!! Ok for your cauliflower haters, I swear this is by far the absolute best cauliflower crust I've ever had, you'd never know! I went basic for my first time, mostly because thinking when hangry is hard. Their Anna Wintour My Way pizza is a build your own. I just kept it simple with tomato garlic sauce and skim cheese. They have vegan cheese and lots of normal as well as vegan toppings. They also have some salads that sound awesome. My pizza actually had a rise tonite, most GF and cauliflower pizzas are thin crust with no rise. This one was soft, perfectly cooked and oh so flavorful! 

I am so glad I stumbled upon this place. Best GF pizza I've had in a very long time. I'm sad I live like 10 states away, but if I am back in Tampa again, this is a must! And yes, it's a bit pricey but the size is enough for two people and all GF is more expensive, that's the reality!

"Why 4 stars? Because this was one of the better meals I've had at Armature Works.

   ---   ---   ---

I really can't get enough of Armature Works, so when my mom was in town to visit, I wanted to take her here to show it off. Because I've been to most of the vendor stations already, I was excited to check out the newest rotating stall - Soul Food Street Kitchen!

Looking at the menu, the ""Not Yo Mamas Meatloaf Sandwich"" was a no-brainer decision. Beef and Pork Meatloaf, Pimento Cheese, BBQ Aioli, Red Onion Jam and Over Easy Egg on a Toasted Bun. Unless someone has a food allergy to one of those things, I can't fathom a person looking at that description and saying, ""eh, that sounds gross.""

I noticed a side called Maquechoux, which instantly intrigued me, mainly because I'd never heard of it. I love trying new things, so I inquired with the girl who rung me up and she told me that it was kind of like a succotash. Sold!

The meatloaf sandwich was really great and really messy. Messy pretty much always equals tasty, and that was no exception here. If you're not opposed to a meal that requires thorough use of napkins after every bite, I encourage everyone to try this. 4.5 stars.

The maquechoux was fine - it was a corn base that's pretty similar to a succotash, indeed. I'd probably opt for an alternative next time. 3.5 stars.

It looks like a seafood restaurant but decor is old people cafeteria ( so is the music .) We think the theme is supposed to be an Italian restaurant but still not sure.

We ordered a $13 BLT that had all lettuce and literally one piece of bacon on it. I ordered mimosas but the champagne was completely flat .

The drinks are very creative with very creative names. One particular one I like is called ""Jungle Juice."" It's an italian soda with coconut syrup, mango and something else. I'm not sure because I get it confused with another one. It's really neat that they have different teas, lattes, italian soda, etc. They also serve health-friendly food, and a variety of organic products made by local people.
The drinks and food are a bit pricey for my liking, but I guess I like the drinks and food more than the price, because I'm willing to pay!
This has a great atmosphere and is great for local and traveling artists to play. There is a quaint little stage, an eclectic group of people, young and old, from all walks of life (I've seen dogs there, and no one seems to mind!), and importantly, camaraderie. Even with old people like me ;)
I highly recommend this place, but be prepared to pay 4 bucks for a cup of coffee.
I recommend paying with cash though, as with cards you must have a 10 dollar minimum (at least the last time I was there it was that way. So maybe it has changed in the past month?).

"I must give this place one star to post a review.  OK, maybe the pizza deserves more stars. Yet my experience can't give them...
I've been to Jackson's many times and have no complaints. So when my friends and I arrived there 11:10 PM on Friday, 6/7/13, after a concert and were told the kitchen was closed, we were surprised but still hungry. The gentleman at the door suggested we could still get something to eat at their restaurant in the building...Slice and Rice. 
We arrived at Slice and Rice and the woman behind the counter was very nice but upset to learn there was a concert at the Forum and most folks were headed her way. She was unprepared and understaffed. She was making calls to someone without results. 
We placed our order, three for pizza, one for sushi and headed around the corner to a seating area out of designer hell. Cold raw aluminum tables, many missing chairs. Now add harsh fluorescent lighting to the mix and drab beige paint on the walls. 
I went back to the counter to get my sushi, since my friends already had their pizza, but mine still wasn't made. The kind lady at the register taking orders for the Pizza Maker in the back told me SHE had to make the sushi, he doesn't make it. I stood waiting on the side.
There was a display case with sushi ingredients at the very front and top of the counter. They were refrigerated but some unwrapped and looked dry. I thought since this was the end of the day, they were to be thrown out, on display, not used for sushi making but I was wrong...However, when she picked up the rotten avocado, sliced it and put it on my roll, I politely asked her if she could use a different avocado. She threw the entire roll out, starting again. She wet her gloved hands so much, the rice would not stick together...and made it tasteless. The worst part of this, it's a sushi restaurant! This should not be happening! 
The two hard working people that night were unprepared for the crowd that descended upon them but the place itself desperately needs work. Customers were leaving in droves, tired of waiting. New folks would arrive then they would leave after waiting a very long time.
Jackson's relative, Slice and Rice, is a distant one with no resemblance whatsoever!

I really wanted to like this place since it's the first one around my area and I'm a huge Poké fan but sadly it did not live up to my expectations. I'm giving it 3 stars only because the fish quality was very good. The tuna was so soft and flavorful and the place was really clean. Unfortunately everything else was not as good. The rice basically tasted like minute rice to me that I could've made at home. It was saugy and not very sticky as sushi rice is supposed to be. The toppings were good but so minimal I thought the girl at the counter was joking when she picked up a half tea spoon of the fish eggs for my bowl. I think I could count how many eggs were in there. The fried garlic flakes and furikake I chose was non existent I could barely see it. They did give me a hefty spoon of avocado which of course is always extra. Overall i probably would not return considering it was a little pricey for what you get.,0,A,Poké Fish,Poké Fish,Poké Fish,3.0,NEGATIVE

"Went to this restaurant based on recommendations from other yelp-ers  We were here from Los Angeles with my sister and brother-in-law.  We were a little worried when we walked in and there weren't many people, but it was Thursday.   By the time we left several tables had been filled.

To start the beer came with frozen glasses. The best, had to have two.  My sister-in-law wanted hot tea  and they don't serve hot drinks.  Had a great waitress who warmed up iced tea for her.  She took the time to get it right for her.

Based on recommendaton, we had the queso fundido, half with chorizo and half with chilles.  It was the best ever.  I would return just to have that.  Chips were fresh and tasty. 

We added the tortilla soup (one mild and one spicy) which was very flavorful.  The tacos my brother-in-law had were excellent.  My sister-in-law wanted a bean taco. When she ordered it with black beans,  the waitress suggested brown beans, afraid the black would be too moist.  Again, she helped her out with great suggestions.

"Today my family and I attended the Cuban Sandwich Festival in Ybor City. I wish I could review the event as a whole, because we were very disappointed overall, but we were not disappointed with Alessi. Basically, Alessi was the only vendor at the festival that was approachable without waiting in an insane (like 50+ people) line.

The reason that Alessi did not have a line, I think, is that they only had cold Cubans, not pressed. We were there rather late for lunch and my kids were starving, so we decided to give the Alessi cold Cuban a try. We really wanted a Miami-style Cuban (no salami), but could not locate the only Miami-style Cuban vendor that was supposed to be there. So a Tampa-style Cuban (with salami) it was. 

The Cuban was very good, with fresh soft bread and tasty meats/cheese/pickle. The people at the kiosk were very friendly and happily cut the sandwich into four pieces for us all to share (my two kids, husband, and myself).

We were expecting to have a wide variety of vendors to choose from, but that was not the case. We could have gotten a corn dog, chicken, rice and beans, all kinds of fried stuff...just not a big choice of Cubans.

"This review is based strictly on service.
After having a shit morning myself, I have to say this experience was the tip of the iceberg for me.

I walked in to be ""greeted"" by someone that seemed to be IMMEDIATELY irritated by the fact that I was there.
I say ""greeted"" because she simply just starred at me waiting for an order without any verbal greeting at all.
Probably the second costumer of the day and things were already sour.
As she continued to stare at me I said ""hi, how are you today?"" And she continued to ignore me then asked what I wanted.

She gave extremely small portions of everything I ordered, and I nicely asked if it was possible to have a little more so she yelled to the cashier to charge me double.

Almost to completion of my burrito, the only words I got from her were ""Anything else?""

The cashier was sweet, patient with the exact cash protocol (which also wasn't brought to my attention until checkout).
Even opened my coke for me (the cashier being so kind was the only reason I didn't leave me food there and leave)

Then while cashing out, middle of a conversation with the cashier, the lady RUDELY yelled ""do you want a bag?"".
At first I wasn't certain she was speaking to me, considering I was discussing change options at the register.
But she made sure to repeat it again even louder than the first time.

Not to mention she verbally announced how ""irritated"" she was in the middle of making the customer behind me's order.

So I'll leave her with some advice.
As someone in The service industry myself, customer service and attitude are EXTREMELY important.
You're human, you're allowed to be upset and irritated and pissed off.. but when a PAYING CUSTOMER is in your presence, that changes IMMEDIATELY.

First off, we were going to sit out front in the tiki bar area, but the first thing I noticed was a child sitting at the bar. To me, that's just a no no, so I decided to sit inside so that I wouldn't end up saying anything.
The inside was beautiful, and it was nice to be in the ac. Our bartender was really nice, and very helpful. 
I had to try the jumping the shark drink, and it was very tasty. I saw the bartender put a good amount of rum in the drink, but it still tasted very balanced.
Then we tried the meat skewers. Let me say that they were very good. Presentation left something to be desired, and I didn't think the meat looked very good quality, but the taste and execution really made up for it. However at one point The chef came out to ask us how everything tasted, but to me he had a very aggressive and almost threatening presence, that kind of scared me. Even if I wanted to complain I don't think I would have been able to. Luckily everything was good so that didn't matter.

"Wasn't aware of how family-oriented this place was, judging by the exterior. Almost felt like a more mature-up-scale Chuck E Cheese! Totally didn't mind the random children running and yelling around because I was there for the pizza! Decoration is spunky, fun, and red! Obviously, their specialtiy is pizza and you can customize it as you like. Their Buffalo Wings were a great starter! Quality pizza was good but that's about it. I felt like the texture was missing something as well as the flavors. Medium was quite small as it's mostly made up of the fluffy crust. Nothing special to give you food orgasm.

"I haven't been in this world of beers in quite some time. With all the local breweries opening in the area world of beers has become a second thought. That being said they're definitely an awesome concept and over the years I've spent plenty of cash there. 

After dinner friends wanted to go and have a couple pints and I happily agreed. I have to say I haven't been to this location in a long time but it definitely was a relaxed atmosphere and very drama free. At times WOB can be a little crazy with a younger crowd full of piss and vinegar. But on the night we went which happened to be a Saturday it was very mellow, awesome crowd, great music and a real inviting staff.

Thanks for a great experience and having an awesome selection of beers on tap as always. You've restored my faith in the world of beers and will return again!

"Just ate here for the first time today. I have lived in South Tampa for about a year and a half now, and have driven by several times always w/ the intention to try. I have tried a few other BBQ places in Tampa and Uncle Rodney's is FAR ABOVE the rest. If you are looking for a no frills, ALL ABOUT THE FOOD-place to eat, GO HERE! The owner is a honest, funny, straight forward guy who treats his customers w/ respect.  He was very welcoming and had a great conversation with him.  I have gone to other BBQ places in town and order 1lb of brisket by itself, at Uncle Rodney's, his '1lb' is DOUBLE the size of others! Everything about this place is 100% legit! I don't have one bad thing to say about this place. This 'Mike C.' Character above complaining about the place is just mad b/c he can't walk around with his pants down to his ankles.

"Went back to Smoky Bones on saturday evening and had terrible service.  First I asked for the wine list.  The server could not find one and asked if we wanted white or red.  He then rattled off the wines in red and white that we might have been interested in.
We then each ordered a combo platter.  My wife ordered one with pulled pork and barbequed chicken.  After about twenty minutes the server came out and said that they were out of the chicken that she had ordered.  She changed her selection for the second item in the combo.  When the food was served only one item was on her plate. The server said that the second item would be right out.  It did come out as we finished our meals (about twenty minutes after we started eatinc).  We sent it back and I refused to pay for it.
They are slipping terribly and need to get their act together.",2,A,Smokey Bones,Smokey Bones,Smok3y Bon3s,2.0,NEGATIVE
"My husband and I went to brunch here recently and we really enjoyed the atmosphere and our food. 

Service: 4/5 our server was very kind and personable and our food came out hot. However, it took awhile for our drinks to be refilled and to receive our check when we were done eating. The restaurant was almost empty so it was surprising that it took awhile for these things. Overall, it was a great experience though! 

Food: My husband ordered the filet hash and I had the eggs Benedict. He devoured his hash and absolutely loved it! His eggs were a little overdone for being poached, but the meat and potatoes were seasoned and cooked well and he really enjoyed the meal. My eggs benedict was also pretty good.. the eggs were poached perfectly, the Canadian bacon was delicious, and the English muffin was perfectly toasted. However, the hollandaise was very lemony which took away from the deliciousness of the perfectly cooked Benedict and my potatoes were very over seasoned compared to my husbands. Although I wasn't very fond of the hollandaise and my potatoes were a bit overseasoned, the meal as a whole was still good and we enjoyed our experience.

"Both my wife and I after reading previous reviews seriously considered cancelling our Groupon. But we didn't really read much on the quality of the food, so we decided to check it out for ourselves. I told Jessica our waitress about what the reviews had said. She told us that the food was really really good. She recommended ""Chicken Sharma Plate"" as being her favorite, which I ordered. My wife ordered the ""Mediterranean Sampler"".

Both of us were very pleased with how good the food really was. All the food was seasoned just right and we couldn't stop eating it. Food that was suppose to be served hot was hot (meat, rice, pita bread and etc) and food that was suppose to be cold was cold (lettuce, tomatoes, hummus and etc).

We also asked if they had a house Merlot wine. She said that they serve ""Barefoot Merlot"". I asked her if she had anything a little better. She said, ""The owner also owns the liquor store next door. What brand do you like? I can get you a glass."" I thought, ""Wow, this is a first"". I told her that I like the Australian Yellow Tail Merlot. She said, ""I will go, get a bottle, open it up and get a glass for both of you. We were both impressed.

The reason I'm only giving 4 stars is we went at 4:30 in the evening. Both my wife and I felt the music was a little loud. Jessica said in the evening the music is much louder. When my wife and I go out to eat we like to be able to talk to each other. We don't want to try and talk over the music. We feel it should be back ground music.

"I have ordered take out twice from Nani's and both times have been pretty good.  Nice people behind the counter.  I picked up Cubans for some guys working on our house and they said they were good sandwiches, they include tomato/lettuce so not completely true to form.  The deviled crab is pretty good.  A little heavy on breading but crab was good on flavor, it's hard to compete with Brocato's but this was better than a lot of what I've tasted.  They have a deal where you can buy a Cuban with chips for $3.99 which is a great deal.  If the tomato/lettuce bothers you, ask for it without and I'm sure they'd be happy to oblige.

First, we walked in through the wrong door and right away an employee saw us and guided us to the correct spot.  Being our first time there, the cashier really took her time to explain the entire menu to us.  Then came the food.  YES!  I had brisket with fries and baked beans and my wife had the pulled pork with sweet baked potato and baked beans.  I know that the food is great when I'm full but can't stop eating....  This was certainly the case.  Brisket was so tender, moist and flavorful that you really didn't need to add any of their sauces, but if you want to add sauce, they have a great selection.

You have to have reservations and they theme the menu based on the show.  We were not seeing ""Hello Dolly"", but were actually there for another show in a smaller theatre.  Regardless of that, we enjoyed the menu greatly.

Our waitress visited our table when we sat down and let us know that her goal was for us to enjoy our meal and not be rushed to get to our show.  It was a nice touch that they kept on top of the meal with the show time.  They have a full bar and drinks are priced as they would be at any nicer restaurant.

It is a flat price that includes salad bar and dessert.  The salad bar was awesome.  On top of salad, there was meat and cheese, pasta salads, and 2 soups to choose from.  Everything was fresh and I had to watch myself to not fill up before my meal.

As for our meal, I got a steak dish and my spouse got a chicken with a cream sauce.  We enjoyed both so much that we ended up sharing them.  For dessert I got Devil's food cake and my husband got Tiramisu cheesecake.  Both were lovely!

I have been to this bar at least 10 times but the last time was my last because I had the worst experience ever.  I went with a group of 6 guys (my brothers cousins brother in laws) to celebrate a guys night out.  We were all standing in the front of the outside bar where there is a long table that is by the line of entry and right next to the bouncer.  As anyone knows who has been there the drink prices are a little on the high side but that didn't deter us because they have a decent selection.  I bought my party a round of drinks (45ish bucks with tip) and we stood at the table and began enjoying our first drink of the night.  immediately after an obnoxious patron pounded on the other side of the table maybe laughing at a joke or who knows... The flimsy table we were at shook violently and knocked all our beers to the ground.  I politely went to the person that knocked all our beers to the ground and asked him why he knocked our drinks down. He reacted quite rudely because he was obviously over served.  I asked him if he could please replace our drinks for causing a party foul and eventually he agreed but only after he finished his drink.  I said we would like our drinks now and he told me to fuck off.  I work at a bar myself and I know that even-though at that point I wanted to punch the guy in the face it would not be worth it so I spoke with the bouncer. The bouncer did not care at all.  So I went to another bouncer and he did nothing either. He actually told me not to look at the guy because at that point our party was getting quite upset and the drunk patron was being combative and called us homos.  After complaining to several people and almost getting in a fight with the over served patron we decided to leave.  The bar did not offer to buy us another round to replace the spilled round all under our table nor did they even throw the drunk guy out.  The drunk guy taunted us as we left even-though we were bigger and more in number.  In the end we got no where with their nonreactive staff and as far as I know the asshole that knocked our drinks over was probably friends with people who worked there.  This bar is a joke and clearly does not care about its patrons or their safety.  I should have kicked the shit out of that guy in hind site it would have been worth it.   World or Beer is overpriced and gives you shitty slow service and you better pray to god if someone does anything bad to you while you are there because they dont give a shit.

"This meal was delicious!!!! We ordered a bunch of appetizers like the Arepas, yucca cheese bites, pork belly ceviche, and the empanadas. We loved everything we ordered & the ambiance is so cool.
