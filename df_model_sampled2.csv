"So to start, I should let you know that I haven't been here drunk or grabbed a burger so I obviously don't know what the heck I'm talking about!

I stopped in to Fresh Mouth to get their french fries. I had them when one of my friends got take out. They were so delicious I think I had dreams about them. This isn't unusual for somebody who should most likely be in P.A., you know Potatoes Anonymous. I ended up ordering the Numbskull Club. It's turkey, bacon, ham cheese,  lettuce, tomato smothered in secret sauce and held together between two pieces of texas toast. I have to say it was super messy and I'm sure I looked like slob eating it but I'd do it again, possibly on a first date. In order words, it was really delicious. The fries are to die for. They are seasoned crinkle fries (which I think is the least appreciated type of fry). A bonus is the sandwich leaks special sauce which is great for dipping your fries in.

They have Blue Bell ice cream to make milk shakes. If I weren't so full I would have given it a try. They hand spin them so I'm willing to bet they are delish!

Fresh mouth isn't fine dining and I can't speak to the burgers but I loved the food. I'll be going back.... probably intoxicated so I can understand what Collin is talking about.",26,B,Fresh Mouth,Fresh Mouth,Fresh M0uth,4.0
"Drive down Armenia Avenue and in between the Colombian and Cuban restaurants, you will find Chifa Gino's. Blink, and you may miss it. 

Chifa Gino's specializes in Chifa dishes which are a mix of Chinese and Peruvian cuisine. The most popular dish is the Arroz de Chaufa, which basically is fried rice made with eggs, vegetables, and meat. Much of Peruvian cuisine is highly influenced by the large number of Chinese immigrants that migrated there in the mid 1800s. 

The ambiance doesn't exactly scream fine dining but the food quality and large portions make up for it. 

I ordered a lunch special for $7.99 which included a beverage (I ordered an Inca Kola, of course), fried wontons, and the Arroz Chaufa de Pollo (Chicken Fried Rice). My boss ordered the Tilapia Ceviche.

The fried wontons were light, fluffy, and delicious. The Chicken Fried Rice was even better. The portion was huge. I was able to take some home and have it for a midnight snack, breakfast, and lunch the next day! $7.99 for four meals for me is a steal! 

My boss enjoyed his ceviche and even said it was better than a restaurant's that we frequently dine at when we work together. 

Parking is VERY LIMITED here and the restaurant shares the lot with a neighboring Columbian restaurant, so try to get to the restaurant early. Peruvians don't normally eat until 1-2, or so I have been told.

I will definitely return to dine here just for the meal value and huge portions!",25,B,Chifa Gino's,Chifa Gino's,Chif@ Gino's,4.0

I don't live more than six minutes away from this place and I chose delivery and so and so person I'm not saying their name

Grab my order and left at 6:58 PM and I didn't get my food until 7:40 pm I sat on the phone for more than 20 minutes almost trying to speak to somebody and nobody would answer the phone this place is a joke and customer number service is ass , never ever again ordering from this place that's why I stay true to Pizza Hut 

After 20 minutes and multiple phones calling the same place they finally answered one of our phones and their excuse is our driver has more than seven deliveries who the hell grabs more than seven deliveries and goes the most farthest place and then leave us for last when we're not even six minutes away thanks to them we got are food cold as hell.

"I don't know where these positive reviews came from but here's my experience:
1.Front desk blonde Cuban lady is rude. She looks so miserable at her job and she's working with customers. Please atleast fake a smile.
2. Mongo is soft. However, no flavor very bland and the meat on the side was very hard/dry with NO flavor.
3. The amount of rice you get is like a kids meal. The red beans was all liquid and maybe 10-15 beans inside the cup. No flavor literally tasted like water and salt.
4. Sweet plantains weren't ripe.
5. Arroz con gandulez was soft but bland and the pork chops that I ordered on the side were super crunchy and hard to the point where I felt like my mouth was being scraped.

But you know what I give to them?! Their mayoketchup was bomb I put that on everything!!! That's how you know the food was terrible. Please go to MARTIN BBQ on Waters Ave for better quality and quantity!",16,B,Tito's Latin Kitchen,Tito's Latin Kitchen,Tit0's Latin Kitchen,1.0

"Just went there this evening for the 1 dollar burger deal they have on Monday night ....First off I  knew there was a catch, come on a dollar for a burger? well there was.. you pay a buck for the burger and depending upon the toppings you put on which can cost .50 to .75 cents per topping  the price goes up from there. However, the burger is still relatively cheap (roughly 1/2 price).... and for good reason! I ordered two cheeseburgers, some onion rings and a drink came to 10 dollars and some change I figured well i could eat at Five Guys for this but hey, everyone needs a little variety right? So I go and sit down and wait on my food, service was very prompt and the dining area is cool with lots of booths and a couple TVs throughout showing the games and news( Three stars for that aspect of the review). I received my food and overall it looked very tasty, the onion rings were nice and golden brown and the burgers seemed a respectable size. Then I actually tasted the two and thats where this review goes sour.
        First off when you serve a burger that I can get at Burger King that tastes the same and you call yourself a burger joint you have got a problem and for Frankies this is the case, I bit into the burger to find a small, thin and relatively dry hamburger patty that tasted like a frozen patty that you can get at any grocery store. The toppings tasted fine but the fact that the patty was so small I felt like I was eating a lettuce burger with hamburger for the topping, So I thought well maybe the onion rings will be the saving grace..WRONG! If you like frozen, minced onion, onion rings then you will be right at home me on the other hand like onion rings that have the whole onion intact and dont taste like a nasty pungent white onion that have been battered and fried up in a ring form. Overall I can say that the experience was less than desirable and my discontent was only really covered up by  the fact that I had tried a new establishment out and that I had at least hit them on dollar burger night because if I had paid full price I would have been PISSED!  In closing my recommendations would be --Don't waste your time no matter the price and just go ahead and make the trek the other direction on Kennedy and go to Five Guys! You'll thank me!",5,A,Frankies,Frankies,Fr@nkies,1.0

"I am continuing my mission to avoid Starbucks and visit more local coffee shops which lead me to DI Coffee Bar. So far Ive been here about 3 times and had a pretty good experience. The only reason I go to coffee shops in the first place is because I get too distracted at home and the coffee shop environment allows me to be productive. Some of the things I look for include the hours, work space, the music level, the coffee prices and quality. 

This place has great hours M-Th 6:30AM-9PM, F 6:30AM-11PM, Sat 8AM- 11AM, Sun 8-6PM. I usually come to coffee shops for 6+ hours so the week day hours are PERFECT. 

In terms of the work space, I gotta say DI coffee has an incredible amount of tables and chairs. There is also space outside to work as well. There is bar space outside where most of the social coffee visits seems to take place. There is a bar space inside which has multiple outlets to charge your computer. They also have 2 big wooden community size tables that seat about 6-8 people. This gets a 5/5 stars. The music is noticeably loud but they play pretty mellow music so its not overly distracting.

All of their drink coffee drinks are made using Panther Coffee except for their Cafe con Leche which is made with Cafe Naveria (which is a darker roast compared to Panther Coffee---as I was told), I typically get the soy latte whenever I go to a coffee shop. The latte at this location comes in 12oz and 16oz cups ($4 and 4.50 respectively) and soy milk is an additional $0.50. The price is pretty comparable to other local coffee shops around here...maybe a tad more expensive. I usually ask for ""light ice"" because I spend a long time drinking my coffee while I work and I don't want it to get watered down...but they put wayyyy too much ice in my drink. They also have different dessert and small meals. I recently tried the gluten free cookie (2 for $1) which tasted better than any regular cookie Ive ever had. 

Overall I would give this place a 4.5 stars. The reason its not quite 5 stars is because the staff isn't the friendliest people in the world (Ive noticed it all 3 times Ive been here). It's not a big issue but it would be unfair to the ""friendlier"" places if I give this place 5 stars. And also because of the excessive ice problem. Other than that I love this place and I will definitely be a frequent flyer at DI Coffee.",23,B,DI Coffee Bar,DI Coffee Bar,DI Coff33 Bar,4.0

When another customer came back to complain about the pork, I walked up and said that I agreed with her and that it was terrible.

"My lovely husband and I decided to do a date night at Tampa Theatre.  We decided to head downtown early for some pre-movie drinks.  Without a plan of where to go, we stumbled into The Anchor Bar.  I really liked it!

We sat at the bar and the bartender that was serving us was so friendly and chatty.  My husband, who is a beer guy, was impressed with the fact that Anchor Bar had all of his favorites on tap (Jai Alai, Fat Tire, etc).  I had a beer and then saw that it was 25% off wine on Wednesday so I switched to wine.  For a glass of Nobilo that is usually $7, the 25% off was quite nice! 

This is a smaller establishment, so I would not recommend coming in with a large group but it is a great spot to catch a game and hang with friends.  There was a good mix of regulars and newbies the night we were there.

First Akemi and the other gentleman (I did not get his name) were truly welcoming to me. I felt comfortable and cared for here. I was her for just 10 minutes but that 10 minutes was not a wasted 10 minutes. It was a rainy day and after I received my food and drink I was about to leave than. Outside started to rain and I waited outside at the door ready to run to my car! But Akemi came to me with her umbrella and helped me to my car with was across the street. Not imagine downtown Tampa parked across the street with traffic and now raining lol SMH!! But I was shocked I will recommend this establishment to anyone that wants Japanese food!! The only CON I would have to mention is the parking. There is a pay by plate across the street in a parking yard but they charge $11.00 for the 0-6 hours parking time. You cannot get a time only for 30 minutes or less. But I did find a parking spot on the street corner for $2.50 per hour which was much more reasonable.

"I would rate this restaurant 4.5 to be more specific. What made my family's first dining experience at The Spaniard worth every penny was our server Jordan D. From the moment I opened to door, he was exuding such charisma that we were excited to dine. Not only was he hosting, he was also serving and bussing the tables...it was a one man show that night but he did is gracefully and kept a smile on his face! 

Oh! The food?! Oh yeah, the star dishes were the tostones and the mussels; busting with flavor and extremely large portions! Get it, you won't regret it! The soy glazed hen was sold out so we opted for the duck. I prefer my duck to have a crispy skin and tender on the inside, there's was a bit chewy for me. Overall, I really enjoyed the creativity from the chef! 

I really enjoyed the experience.

"Adorable coffee shop that serves Illy coffee - the best, most smooth roast, with limited availability in Tampa for some reason. I was elated to see the familiar red logo behind the counter. 

I ordered an iced Americano that was the best coffee I've had, since I last flew out of TPA where there's an actual Illy shop. 

This cute coffee shop also offers paninis and pastries that all looked appealing, nicely displayed in the case. I opted for the chocolate cake that was a perfect accompaniment to my unsweetened coffee.

"For what it is I like it. I appreciate the toasting of the sandwich. I like the tuna salad more than subways, but less than Publix. They have way less topping options than  most sandwich places but Since this is the only one I have been to I don't know if that is because the airport location or the chain in general. 

I put Dijon mustard, lettuce (ask for more), tomatoes, and Italian seasoning on my tuna. Only half of the smash which gets toppings so I are the side without them first and saved the topping side  for last. I like that they cut the sandwich in half so it is easier to eat. 

My hubby definitely ordered better than I did as the salad looks really good and it has lots of meat on it for him to enjoy.

"Food and service and food hit or miss. We eaten there before COVID and had decent food but really lousy service. A few times it was better. Went today, food was better but will not go back until their servers are wearing masks. One server takes order, nice but no mask; then the person ( not same as woman who took our order) coming straight from kitchen with our food and delivering it to table no mask! So obviously the kitchen is not compliant.

However walking into this place and seeing Phil today changed that. It's crazy how a simple smile can improve your entire day. Phil did that for me today. It was busy and he was occupied but he dropped what he was doing to make sure the customers were taken care of properly. I was greated quickly and with a contagious smile. He was helpful and personable. Honestly he is one of the kindest people I have spoken to all week. In that brief 2 minutes he turned my frown upside down.

"We came in for a romantic date night and that is what we got. By sheer coincidence  we had a very early reservation because my husband got home early. If you want a very romantic experience take the 5:30pm reservation and you will be the first there. It took about an hour for people to trickle in after that. We had a very attentive waiter, think like that of what you would experience at ta five star restaurant. The decor of the restaurant is simple and beautiful in style and aesthetic. I loved the spice wall and open space of the building. Ok, so the food is simple, fresh, and beautiful just like you would expect at Bistro BT. The steamed lobster salad was absolutely fantastic. My husband and I split it because we weren't sure how much it would end up being serving size wise. It was large enough for both of us to split and we both got the same entree which was great. My husband loved the duck burrito as the favorite of the dinner (he loves duck). Parking can be limited, the parking lot is small and there is no street parking. Dinner ended up being around 210-ish, but it was on par with what I would expect for the level of food and service we received. A lot of the menu is gluten free also.

"I can't recall how I first came across Sucre Table. It might have been on Instagram. But as soon as I saw the first pastry photo, I knew I had to make a visit. It took a while between first being introduced to sucre table and actually getting my foot in the door because we live about 45 mins north and they're only open on Saturdays during the weekend. 

Today was my lucky day...and I am in love! We tried the chocolate praline, choco orange bar, and croissant muffin of the month--soursop and cream cheese filled. All of them were amazing. The chocolate praline was a dark chocolate shell filled with chocolate mousse and caramel with a crunchy praline bottom. It wasn't too sweet or rich. It was one of my favorites and would definitely order again. 

My other favorite was the croissant muffin. I stopped by shortly before 5pm, so I was worried the pastries might not be the freshest, but it was absolutely perfect. The layers of the croissant were buttery and light. The filling was cream cheese and soursop--which I had no idea what that even meant. But it's a yummy fruit filling that was just sweet enough. I'm really looking forward to trying more soursop pastries as well as their other croissant muffins of the month.

The choco orange bar had really moist chocolate cake with dark chocolate coating. I didn't taste much of the orange though, so it wasn't my favorite of the bunch. 

I saw large cake slices, Japanese cheesecakes, croissants, and kouign amanns--which is next on my Must Try list.

With the courtyard closed for a private event, we sat at the bar, sipped wine, tried the steak & frittes with chimichurri sauce and people watched!
The staff behind the bar is amazing! They were so friendly and knowledgeable.
The wine either comes in a wine glass or you can take one of their traveling sippy cups for a spin! They are fantastic!! I was sipping a lovely petite syrah. It was everything promised and more! 
The steak was AMAZING. Perfectly cooked and beautifully presented! The chimichurri sauce was more of green paste that tasted beyond yummy!! There are a variety of sauces you can order, get this one. It's the best blend of savory with a bit of spice at the end.

"It's apparently a Japanese restaurant but I was recommended here for their Korean food. To preface this review, I have an unconditional love for Korean food; I am half Korean and have visited Seoul.

First and foremost, I firmly believe that any dining experience begins with atmosphere/cleanliness... the booth - not clean, the table - spots of sticky residue, bugs on the table - present (many were killed during the meal). This is absolutely unacceptable by any restaurant standard. Service was also a bit lacking. I went during a non-peak day/time and it was difficult to get the attention of any of the waitstaff.

Now to the food... average... very, very average. I'm not sure if it was the hype leading up to the meal or what, but I was not impressed. The side dishes were probably the best things there. For my entree, I ordered a traditional Korean dish -- Noodles with Black Bean sauce -- and it was good, not great... a bit on the bland side. I preferred my friend's stone-pot mixed rice bowl, but it's hard to mess that up.

I'm not usually the type to judge based on one visit. Quite the contrary, in fact, I'm usually the type to give a place a second chance if the first doesn't go so well. Well I'm going to make an exception for this place considering my sub-par visit. Based on cleanliness alone, I don't think I'll be returning unless I start to hear raving reviews in the near future... which is improbable... but with some major convincing I'd be willing to give it a second try.",37,C,Ginza Japanese Steakhouse,Ginza Japanese Steakhouse,Ginza Japanese Steakhouse Inc.,2.0

"This Burger King, like every other Burger King, is about as average as average can be. This means that there are always stuff you like and stuff you think can be better. Stuff I thought that they did well: the drive through line was pretty fast and efficient for a busy Friday morning. From start to finish, only took about 15 minutes max for me to order, get my food, and pay. The people working the drive through were courteous and took the order efficiently. Out of the food, the hash browns were very well done. Nice and crispy with a fluffy interior. Burger King was also very generous with their portion for the hash browns. What I think they could have done better: the ham and cheese croissanwiches were rather sad looking. Slightly soggy with the filling not evenly laid out, it looked a mess. The coffee was also so watered down that you might as well call it coffee flavored water. But what do you expect? It is Burger King after all. You want a legit breakfast?

"This place was horrible.  I have been there before and the service was never great.  I saw the manager walking around in house slippers.  When I walked in there were 3 people standing at the counter waiting to order, and none of the other employees seemed to care.  The lady who was washing dishes came out and said she would be right with us, then came back after disappearing in the back.  The manager walked right past all of us and the cash register and said nothing.  The lady finally came to take orders.  I ordered a root beer float and a 2 piece fish meal, because I do not eat chicken.  She took the two gentlemen's orders after me, then I went to sit down with my girlfriend.  After waiting about 15 minutes I see the lady bring the food to the guy who was 2 people behind me.  I went to the register, and the lady was gone again, and the guy after me was still standing there.  She then came out of the back and looked surprised.  She then goes and throws too ALREADY made pieces of fried meat into the backed with french fries and brings it to me.  I go and sit down, the first bite I take, is chicken.  I go right back up to the counter and ask for the manager.  The lady who took my order runs to the back, then the pregnant drive thru lady asks what it wrong.  I asked if she was the manager, and she said yes, which I knew was a lie.  I told her that I received bad service, waited too long for my food, and my order was wrong and I wanted a refund.  She said okay and gave the exact cost for the item individually.  I couldn't believe it.  I wanted all of my money back, but I just left.  She made no offer of compensation.

"I was very happy to see someone open up a new pizza business here because it's right in my neighborhood off of N Himes Ave. I 've been here 3 times now & while I do hope they are successful, I feel that if they don't make a couple of changes, they will not be around for very long.

1st off, their pizza is REALLY good but both times I got their pizza, it was a 14"" cheese pizza, and I feel they are a bit light handed on the sauce & cheese which is a shame because both have great flavor. It costs almost $13 for a 14"" cheese pizza while nearby competitor's are less expensive & not so light on the cheese & sauce. This place only has two sizes of pizza...
14"" & 18"" pizzas. Their 18"" pizza prices are more in line with their competitors but the 14"" pizzas are not. Note to Hanks....if you are going to charge more you should give more.

If I was basing my rating on the pizza alone it would be 4 stars but I feel it could be 5. What makes this place a 2 star place, at best, is because their sub was probably one of THE WORST I have ever had at a pizza place. The sub roll, or I mean hot dog roll, was about 8 to 10"" long and an Italian sub was close to $10!!!! Total rip off!!! That sub roll might work for your BBQ joint but if you are going to make subs right, get a different sub roll because I did like that you DIDN'T skimp on the meats on the sub, there just was't room for anything else after you put the meats on the roll. If other places in this area can get Amoroso rolls perhaps you should look into replacing the extra large hot rolls you are using. 

Lastly, this place is super clean & they have cable TV's to watch sports or whatever. I really hope they will make some changes that could make a big difference between success or failure. BTW Hanks, if you want to charge & get top dollar for your subs, build 'em & make them like Laspadas in the Orlando area does.",19,B,Steve's Pizzeria,Steve's Pizzeria,St3v3's Pizz3ria,2.0

"2.5 Stars

Decent pizza, but certainly not the best in the area.  What they do have going for them is that they deliver for free, if you're within a few miles.

The first time I ordered their pizza, I liked it, although I thought it was odd that the toppings of tomato and spinach were under the top coating of cheese.  The pizza was delivered barely warm that time.

Months go by, and I decide to order from them again.  They have an excellent on-line order form.  The form said that delivery would be in 50 minutes. The form also had a spot to leave a tip, and while I HATE to leave a tip before I get service, I didn't know if there would be another opportunity, so I did.  I completed the check-out, and received a confirmation email saying that the pizza would be there in 60 minutes. 75 minutes go by, and I finally receive my pizza and wings. When I go to sign the form, there is an ""additional tip"" line.  I wonder how many people they scam into leaving a 2nd tip, not realizing the person that ordered it already left one??

Needless to say, both the pizza and the wings I ordered were completely cold. Which is hilarious when you realize that I am 2.2 miles away from the store. Once heated up it was good, although I do feel they are pretty skimpy on the toppings.

"I take my kids and their friends here for special days, such as the last day of summer, getting good grades, and weekends before and/or after exams. I also meet up with my friends here, so I am a regular. 

I really enjoy the salad bar. On a few occasions, the bar wasn't stocked and another couple of times, the spinach was not fresh but slimy and old. However, if it weren't for the garden salad bar, I would not frequent this place nearly as much. It is REALLY good. We also like to get the broccoli cheese soup. However, with the size of the spoon and the lack of size of the bowl, you will either have a difficult time getting the spoon in your mouth or you will finish the soup in 3-4 bites. 

The managers try to get the servers to sell the shrimp fondue every time we come. Two persons I frequent with are allergic, so this gets old after time, but the servers must ask or they will get in trouble, even when they recognize us. Two other items I dislike are the crab cakes and the New Orleans Seafood entrees. They are bland, even for a chain restaurant.

The major complaint: Since Ruby Tuesday began doing the 50% off coupons, the prices have gone up and quality is down in some areas. Instead of going once a week to Ruby Tuesday, we're going whenever we happen to see the coupon in the local newspaper.

Aside from the awesome salad bar, the classic ribs are a favorite for us, the family and our friends. The classic burger is also, but mostly, we enjoy the sirloin with mashed potatoes or rice, depending on who orders a lobster tail. The beer is ice cold and so are the mixed drinks. Overall, I highly recommend this location.",36,C,Ruby Tuesday,Ruby Tuesday,Ruby Tuesd@y,4.0

"So I decided to go here last night with a group of people and based on the reviews I was expecting a great experience but got the complete opposite. To begin, the service was absolutely horrible! We all ordered drinks and it took at least 30-40 mins just to get them and it was not a busy night at all. When we got the drinks, we sent one back because it was horrible and they still charged us for it. So then we ordered the hookah and we asked our server which one she recommended, the Double Apple W/ Mint is what we got but the taste was horrible so we didn't even proceed to hit the hookah, so I asked if there was a way where we cannot get charged for the hookah and they would not make the exception. However, they mixed the flavor to make it taste ""better"" but it was still the same. The music was great, food was great, and the decorations were nice. I like how they had pool tables but it was still difficult to go through one game because there wasn't that much space to play. Overall, we made the best of it but it's definitely our last time!

If you want the best food, don't order the typical Chinese American crap.  Ask about their specialties, try something new.  Almost everything that was suggested by the owner was fantastic.  We ordered 13 dishes and there were only a couple that we wouldn't order again.  Loved the calamari and whitefish in water bath or something like that.  Loved the dry pot combination.

"I booked this cruise to celebrate my 30th birthday with my husband. It rained really hard the night we were booked, and we called to ask them about their rain policy. Basically they said they'd still go out, or if it was too bad, they'd still do the dinner and everything, but remain docked. Why on earth would I pay so much money to sit on a boat at a dock in the rain? I asked about rebooking, and they said yes, as long as we paid extra for the rebooking fee. Fine.

I rebooked for about one month later, which happened to then be our anniversary. Not only did we have to pay the rebooking fee, but an additional $10 because the Fall cruise is apparently more expensive than the summer one (they had just switched over). So at that point, I had paid $210 for two people (we also got the ""romance package"" which was to include an appetizer, photo, reserved seating, and a bottle of champagne).

We boarded the boat and were greeted by really friendly staff. Our seats were fine, but the dining area where we were sat (on the second floor near the bar) was really small and seemed...dingy somehow. There were two TVs on - one with news, and the other playing Cops. At least put on the Bucs game or something! Our server was nice, but he had a very thick accent and he had a hard time understanding us, and us him. 

We ordered ONE of the comically large Sangria drinks, but he brought us one EACH. OK. Well, now we've spent $210 on the cruise itself, and an additional FORTY dollars on two drinks. He brought us the appetizer that was included in our package, which we did not get to choose, and it was ALL shrimp, which neither of us like. I ate a little bit of it, and it was good, but the presentation and quality was questionable. One of the items had pepperjack cheese on it, and it was obvious that it was a pre-cut square that had either barely been melted under a heat lamp, or had been melted properly but then sat out for awhile. The other shrimp item, which I did not try, looked OK. The stuffed mushrooms looked like they had been made earlier in the day - not fresh looking whatsoever. The stuffing inside was watery. Taste was OK though.

Then came dinner. Our server told us about 5 times that it was ""coming now"" and it took over half an hour from the time he first said that until the time the food finally came. My husband got the stuffed gnocchi, and while it tasted great, the presentation was again awful. The plate looked like total mush. The asparagus was soggy and old looking. I got the pork chop. The presentation for that was fine, but the pork chop was not cooked even remotely evenly - pink and chewy in places, cooked fine in other places. And the bone was so huge that it was very difficult to cut. The sides with it were really good though, and so was the sauce. 

For dessert we got the chocolate cake, which was fine, but looked and tasted store bought and like it had either sat out exposed to the air or was just stale. When we asked for the champagne that came with the romance package, imagine my utter diappointment when the waiter came over and unscrewed a small (1 glass each) bottle of the same PROSECCO that had been in the sangria we had earlier. So we paid FIFTY dollars extra for a photo of us pre-boarding (which turned out really nice actually), a glass each of prosecco, a window seat on the side of the boat which faced all the industrial stuff for most of the cruise, and for the happy birthday announcement in which my name was mispronounced (understandable, this happens to me constantly). 

Overall, the food was so disappointing. For the price we paid, I expected not only more choice, but just better presentation and attention to detail. For that price we could have eaten in an upscale restaurant and had a nice bottle of wine. It really seemed like the food was not freshly prepared. BUT, we could overlook all of that because, hey, it's the experience. 

Because the food took so long to come out, by the time we were finished eating, we only had about 45 minutes of the cruise left. By then it had started to rain heavily and so there was no dancing. The deck areas are barely covered, so not everyone could even go outside. 

I expected so much more, and I would absolutely give it another try if someone else was paying. I wouldn't have really had any complaints if I had paid even half of what we did, but for all the money we shelled out, I was quite disappointed.",28,C,Yacht StarShip Dining Cruises,Yacht StarShip Dining Cruises,Yacht StarShip Dining Cruises Inc.,2.0

"Healthy options that fill you up.

I'm a huge salad fan. I don't cook much at home and when I do it rarely includes vegetables. Therefore, when I go out I always try to get my greens in. This restaurant is a very reasonable way to do so.

They subtract the weight of the bowl so you don't have to worry about that. The salad that I built was less than 1 lb and the soup was less than .5 lb! This made my meal come out to about $10, which is a great price point for lunch.

I love how they have little cups to try the dressing and the soups. If they didn't have those, I probably wouldn't have gotten a soup, but after trying the loaded baked potato I had to get a bowl. They also have the ingredients for each soup listed next to them. That's how I knew the loaded baked potato soup has heavy cream. Hey, I needed to balance the healthiness of the salad. 

Randomly, they don't have avocados or candied nuts, but pretty much anything else I would ever put on a salad was there. I wasn't a huge fan of the dressings, I tried a lot of them, so I went with olive oil. In the end I was happy with my salad.

"I've actually been to Kuchi two others times but this particular review is based on my experience there this past Saturday night. My friend and I stopped in for a late bite to eat following a movie at the local AMC theater (that aspect of this location makes it very convenient!). We opted for a table in the bar area as we were not interested in sitting for a big hibachi show. We did however, desire to order the food that is prepared hibachi-style - just did not need it prepared right in front of us.  

We were brought warm towels to begin our experience and shortly after, our server arrived to ask if we were ready to place our orders. I responded by referring to the drink menu we were still browsing (I guess he assumed we were both down for a water-only meal?). Anyhow, we both ordered a glass of the house Cabernet and then proceeded to order our meals. For $27, I went with the Filet and Shrimp entree while my friend ordered the Filet and Scallops (a similar price if I remember correctly). 

As soon as we placed the orders we were served the soup and salad, which comes with the meal and is customary at Japanese Steakhouses. Naturally, as regular Kobe Steakhouse fans, we compared the quality of our meal to the food being served by Kobe. I really preferred Kuchi's salad as this dressing was a lot tastier than that of Kobe. The soup was meh...save your appetite for the main event - which in our case was also just O.K. The filet was the best part, incredibly tender and juicy - despite the fact that our server never even asked how we wanted it cooked. The shrimp was cooked in some type of sweeter sauce that I did not enjoy that much but ate anyway. The vegetables (which included mushrooms to my unexpected displeasure) and noodles tasted fairly standard - and that yum yum sauce...not as yum yum as Kobe's. That is FOR SURE. 

Service was alright but we felt quite rushed at the end of our meal. The server picked up our closed out credit card receipts before we had a chance to finish our first and only glass of wine; and that occurred just after my friend had transferred her leftovers to the Styrofoam box. 

Ultimately, I wouldn't knock this place entirely. It is a bit cheaper than their Kobe competitor, and MUCH easier to get into - at least based on patronage during a regular Saturday night. I highly doubt one would need a reservation unless it were a large party.

Make reservations as this place gets busy quite fast.

You can choose to have 1 course for $5 or go all out with 5 courses for $16. I opted for 5 because why not lol. 

1st course: Ceviche 
2nd course: Chicken tortilla soup 
3rd course: spinach and chorizo salad 
4th course: Chile Rilleno 
5th course: pork chop 

Chile Rilleno and pork chop was my faves on the nite. Salad was great but it was such a small portion (2 bites). Ceviche was good, needed more citrus notes to round out the dish. Soup was my least favorite dish, there was no depth of flavor.  

Overall, better than I expected. I'll def be back (already made reservations for next month lol). 
BTW, bring cash for tips, they don't allow adding it to your bill paid with credit card.",27,B,The Tutored Chef,The Tutored Chef,the tutored chef,4.0
Resturant was half full.  7:30 pm.  Our waiter was Robert H.   Service 1 Star and Food 3 star.   We had to get host to find our waiter twice.  Food cold and almost not edible (heavy hand on salt).   Geeesh.  This is a Corp Store.  BTW Mr Sullivan.  When we tried to pay with your Bonefish App it failed.  Our app said contact server if there was an issue.  Waiter blamed Corp and nothing they could do.  Another waste of time. Way off their game tonight at Henderson Bonefish,8,A,Bonefish Grill,Bonefish Grill,B0nefish Grill,2.0
"Litteraly the best steak sandwich I've ever had from a Cuban place and I've had steak sanwiches from Cubans shops all over Miami. Instead of giving you one solid flat steak you have to gnaw off with the bread, they finely chop up the steak so it's easy to chew. They're steak also isn't chewy at all and almost melts in your mouth with how well seasoned it is. I've gotten the steak sandwich over 5 times now and I've never encountered a weird fatty piece or something I'd spit out. You can get it with ton of toppings but I like to keep it simple and just to steak, fries, easy mayo and cheese. I'd recommend getting the small as it's more than enough for one person. Don't be put off by the sketchy exterior and parking lot. This place is a hidden gem. They're empanadas are flipping amazing btw",35,C,Palm Avenue Sandwich Shop,Palm Avenue Sandwich Shop,Palm Avenue Sandwich Sh0p,5.0
You can see the sign from the Busch Gardens entrance area. I was intrigued by a combination of Chinese and Latin food and I'm always up to try new things. We were a bit hesitant after reading some of he reviews but I wanted to try it anyways. It's a typical takeout joint with about 6-8 tables for dining. When we first got there it was empty but by the time we got our food the tables were full and a line in the waiting area. We were there Saturday night at around 8pm. The portions were large and the taste was good! My husband says it's the best orange chicken he's ever had!  There were strips of orange rind in the sauce and had a nice orange flavor. The mofongo was interesting. Can't say too much about it as I've never had it before and have nothing to compare it to but it was okay. Don't know if I'll order it next time.    We also ordered the general's chicken and fried plantains which didn't disappoint. We don't live in the area but we will definitely visit again when we go to Busch Gardens.,32,C,China Latina,China Latina,china latina,4.0

"I'm going to admit right now, to having driven all the way from Wesley Chapel to get my Pita Pit fix (yeah I know I passed the one on Fowler but this one is way better) and  take it over to Curtis Hixon Park to walk around. Yes, this is a chain (think Subway but with pitas, and fresh healthy ingredients instead of the typical crap) but they must be franchised because each location is very different. 

This location is open super late. I've ended my partying here on several occasions. And on other occasions I've started my partying here. In any event, PIta Pit is in the equation when I take a trip downtown. They also deliver to those in the area, and judging by how quick the guy hops in that buggy and returns, it must be pretty speedy delivery. The food...my favorites are the chicken tzatziki and then black bean. Both are delicious. They have toppings ranging from hummus, spinach, feta cheese, your typical veggie toppings, and then tons of sauces, even tzatziki sauce. Definitely give it a try. It's basically a fast food joint, though, so don't expect any bells or whistles or special ambiance. The location kicks arse, and they are quick and efficient and deliver a great product.

"I meet with a group regularly here to play nerdy battle games and it fits the bill every time.  Any place that has almost 50 beers on tap fits my bill.  That sounded unintentionally dirty and I'm sorry.  

The wait staff is excellent and they let you try beers you aren't sure about, and they've usually got a special beer on tap for cheap.  It changes so sometimes you might get Guinness and another day it might be a smaller craft brew, I guess it depends on what they  need to get rid of, but it's a good deal and they have some great beers on tap every time I've been.  

If you are a whiskey lover, they pride themselves on their selection, but I am not so I didn't bother to get more info.  

If you don't bring your own games (I mean really, what kind of person doesn't have Risk loaded into their briefcase) there are plenty in the bar to choose from.  

They've taken the old Mema's and turned it into something completely unrecognizable (which is fine with me, I was the 1% of Tampa that didn't care for the crusty taco place).  It looks great and even though it is probably three times the size of an English Pub, it has the character of one.  You'd never guess it was new-ish.

The food is hard to judge, I did get the fries and they were good but it's hard to mess that up.  Judging by looks, all of my friends food looks awesome (lobster one night, crab legs another, smothered fries, all got good remarks).

She is quite popular as every review about this place is about how much she sucks at customer service or just being a decent human being. My friend informed her on how upset she is that her food isn't ready when she called prior. Well that woman cut her off, without even apologizing. Then told her to wait ten minutes. Almost 25 minutes later, that woman brings out my friend's and a young gentleman's order to the register. She told the gentlemen to have a nice day, yet she rolled her eyes at my friend and left. I was amazed at this kind of rudeness. How is that place still running with her treating people like that? I have never had food there, but from what I witnessed, I never will.

"Why 4 stars? Because ramen is a welcomed sight in Carrollwood.

   ---   ---   ---

I've been stalking this place for several weeks and was happy to see it finally open recently. I moved from Seminole Heights (foodie capital of Tampa) to Carrollwood a few years ago, and as sad as the restaurant scene is comparatively, we do alright over here. But one thing we don't have is ramen... until now.

I do hope Otsuka does well, especially considering that the majority of this shopping center is either abandoned, or it seems abandoned. That, and the fact that you can really only directly enter the plaza from Dale Mabry when heading southbound are likely to cause some issues for this business, but I hope people give it a fair shot.

We really enjoyed our food! I ordered the #15 ramen (Wagyu Tonkotsu) and my wife ordered the #19 (Ultimate Tonkotsu White.) Both were really tasty, especially mine. I was pleasantly surprised to find that this is some of the better ramen you'll find in the area, in my opinion. And with the place only being open a week, I was even more impressed. And to even leave me *more* impressed, each ramen dish was only like $10-12 and came with plenty of noodles.

We also ordered the karaage for an appetizer, which was also done quite well. 

Was it weird that there was a guy in the kitchen wearing a tank top and flip flops the whole time? Yes. Did that really negatively affect my experience? I'm not sure. It was certainly strange, but the ramen tasted good enough for me to forget about that. Kind of.",35,C,Otsuka Ramen,Otsuka Ramen,Otsuka Ramen,4.0

"We enjoy coming here at least four times per year.  We would come more often but the 75 minute drive is the only deterrent.  We generally arrive approximately 10-15 minutes early and have never had to wait more than a few minutes to be seated. We always request a small room which is quieter.  We have been to every dining room.  Yes, the decor is quaint but this is a truly remarkable experience!  

Service is always second to none!  When you arrive the valet is always friendly, walk inside to the friendly staff and seated with a friendly host.  Within minutes the waiter/waitress arrives.  

We pretty much know the menu but always check for any new additions.  For an appetizer the day boat scallops and the lobster surf rolls are our favorites.  For our dinner the favorites are Filet Mignon and Delmonico steaks.  I also enjoy a nice lobster which is taken out of the shell and ready to enjoy.  Dinner comes with French Onion soup, salad, baked potato, shoe string fried onions, carrots and green beans.  Be careful ordering dinner so as not to eat too much saving room for the dessert which is served upstairs in the dessert room.  What I find very interesting is the salad is always plated exactly the same!  Even the tomato skins are removed! All the delicious salad dressings are made in house.  These are the little touches you come to greatly enjoy!  

Service is always excellent with most wait staff performing perfectly and occasionally I would classify a staff member as very good. It happens!  The wait staff will make a reservation at the dessert room for you.  For first timers I would recommend the kitchen and wine room tour before going to the dessert room.  The waiter will arrange the tour for you.  On one of my kitchen tours I noticed someone drop a salad on the floor and within 15 seconds it was cleaned up incredibly fast!  You can go in the kitchen at 9PM and it is always spotless!  

When you consider the complete experience the dinner check is really not that high.  They do charge a service charge for your wait staff salary.  I will tip 20-30% additional depending on the service.  I would say approximately 90% of the time the wait staff earns the 30% tip.  

Dessert room is again quaint and intimate.  All desserts are made perfectly in house.  Specialty coffees are extremely good.  Even the regular coffee is outstanding!  I will say the cheesecake and the apple pie are my favorite desserts.

"Amalie Arena's Chase Club simply puts all-inclusive food and drink experiences available at Rays or Magic games to shame.

Part of the reason for this is how years ago the Lightning upgraded the Chase Club to include alcohol along with draft beer and house wines as part of the ticket price. That remains the case to date, as I enjoyed both complimentary Svedka and Stoli pours when asking for vodka cocktails just this past weekend. 

However, you must have the Chase Club ticket that does not restrict you to the fifth floor only to have access to the tremendous quality and variety of food. Full liquor bar is also available on the fifth floor, but Heineken draft is only available on the lower level as part of the complimentary draft beer selection.

As a Chase Club ticket holder most recently for the Ducks-Lightning game on Sunday, February 8th, here were the food stations:

 Oysters and shrimp
 Freshly made ravioli
 Made-to-order cheddar grits
 Pulled pork, free range chicken, muffins, mac and cheese, and cole slaw
 Carved turkey and top round sandwiches
 Gourmet burger sliders and hot dogs with toppings added to your wishes
 Mutliple types of flatbread pizzas fresh from the oven
 Tossed and caesar salads
 Three flavors of boneless chicken wings as well as fries and poutine
 Finger foods such as bruschetta, chicken salad served on crackers, gourmet cheeses and fresh vegetables
 Dessert stations featuring various items including chocolate mousse
 Carvel ice cream soft serve machines
 Candy station featuring Starburst, Tootsie Roll pops and at least ten other individually wrapped treats
 Snack station featuring individual grab-and-go bags of Doritos, Lays, trail mix, etc.
 

The Chase Club fifth floor features about four appetizers throughout the game and is generally comprised of egg rolls, empanadas, meatballs, chicken fingers, nachos, etc.

Chase Club ticket holders on the lower level are welcome and encouraged to go up the stairs to the fifth floor if they wish and enjoy food and beverage up there as well. However, Chase Club ticket holders on the fifth floor cannot go down the stairs for food and beverage on the lower level.

Customer service is excellent in the Chase Club and is only surpassed by the ridiculously good variety and taste of all the food available on a nightly basis.

While the Rays' Hancock Bank experience peaked about four seasons ago and the Orlando Magic ""Ultimate Lounge"" only seems to serve full sitdown dinners rather than offering more sensible items for the sporting event crowd, the Tampa Bay Lightning get absolutely everything right in the Chase Club.",30,C,Chase Club,Chase Club,Ch@se Club,5.0
"A concert at Amalie Arena.......restaurant very close!! Met friends down there for dinner!!! 

Hostess took a very long time to greet us then when she did it was a five minute wait because they just sat 20 people. She was rude and unpleasant!  Ok it was 20 people not 20 tables!! Hhhhmm a concert night and you can't handle 20 people? 

Finally were seated and she put the menus on the table and left! Did tell us who our server would be just left!! She had no manners or kindness!!   We walked out!

"Cliff notes version: Your management is incompetent and you got one star. You FAIL.

Full version read here: You really did it today, Reilly's. We called more than two weeks ago for a lunch reservation of 12. Yesterday the office called ahead to 1. Increase that  to 15, 2. Confirm that they will in fact be able to handle us since it was the US World Cup game at lunch time. Again, this reservation was made before the World Cup even started. ""No problem. Your table will be ready"" they said.

So, I was first to arrive. They had three pub tables pushed together (so seats 8) with twelve chairs (we confirmed yesterday for 15). I asked for another table and was denied even though there was an extra table available. When the whole office showed they were not happy. That pretty much royally pissed me off from there. So some of our party sat at the bar since there was no room. Our waitress did her best. Butttttt...

1. The food came out in like orders of two or three. Not kidding, two people were served 45 minutes apart. It was packed so I won't slam you for slowness but at least get out food out together relatively. FAIL

2. Some wings came out undercooked. FAIL

3. They ran out of plates. Not kidding. The reason our food came out at different times was because they had nothing to serve food on. FAIL

4. For whatever reason they decided to prop the front door open. It got hot as hell in there. FAIL

What you should've done was realize you couldn't handle a party like that and be honest so we could go somewhere else. You should've comped some apps to shut us up about how pissed we were. You should've bought some heavy duty paper plates to serve people since you expected a huge crowd.",20,B,Reilly's Westshore Taphouse,Reilly's Westshore Taphouse,Reilly's Westsh0re Taph0use,1.0

However, a nice l a's day did take my order.  I got the deluxe pizza.   I would rate it a 7.  It could have used a little more cheese and the topping were a bit scarce on a few.  Plenty of olives though!  I like the taste of the crust.  It had a nice sweet taste and balance.  Could've been cooked a little longer though.

"Stopped in yesterday for lunch. We ordered a Greek salad. I gave three stars because the salad was mostly lettuce.
2 cups of Romaine lettuce, a little feta cheese a couple of tomatoes, gyro meat topped with Greek salad dressing. I think they only served the  salad with about two to 2.5 ounces of the gyro meat. So it ended up being a lot more lettuce than anything else. It was tasty due to dressing, but just not enough enough for the protein. I could have made this salad at home. 
The restaurant appears to be clean, we ordered it take out so we didn't stick around. The chef seems to be nice enough and quite friendly, talking to us while he was cooking. 
 I really hate to say this but the negative part about the whole thing was the gentleman that took our order. While He also seems like a nice guy,  he must be a heavy smoker because we could smell him across the counter.",7,A,Santorini Greek,Santorini Greek,S@ntorini Greek,3.0

"Live entertainment was nice. This is the reason for the two stars and possibly the only reason I'll come back. My boyfriend and I sat in the dining room as we had reservations at 830. We were told to go back to the back room to be seated. We stood in the door entry for 5 mins without someone seating us. Finally, I went up to a waitress so we could be seated. When we got to our seat we did not get a drink menu. They don't have a wine list. The waitress was not very friendly but we were able to order a glass of wine. The wine was not very good at all and even my boyfriend agreed as he is a wine expert. The menu is very limited and pricey. We were not intrigued by much on the menu so we both got the Blue burger. I substituted the fries for mixed veggies and my boyfriend substituted his for mashed potatoes. When the food arrived my mixed veggies were a teaspoon (that's it) of freezer burnt butternut squash and some unrecognizable food (possibly yuca, which isn't a vegetable) and it had an awful taste to it. The burger was the worst though. My boyfriend ordered his medium and mine medium well. To our surprise it was a frozen cooked patty. It was soft like meatloaf. And both burgers were cooked the same. It had an awful taste. The bun was terribly soggy too. I will never eat there again. Even the other customer's food look unpleasant.

"My recent visit to Tampa led me to visit The Metro Restaurant. As a disclaimer, I want to point out that I occasionally overlook bad or mediocre service if the dishes are good. However, in my recent experience, not only did I receive incredibly poor service, I was also served cold dishes. I ordered the crab cakes and the sweet potatoes as a side dish. I waited almost two hours and received no update or apology from the server. I would like to include that the restaurant was not busy at all. Only 4 of the approximately 15 tables on the lower floor were filled (The upper level was closed off). I was so hungry that I didn't want to complain, fearing that it may take another hour to warm up the dish. 

I wanted to inform the server about the cold dish simply as a ""heads up"" for the future. I was rudely interrupted by him and asked ""can you make it my manager's problem?"" After waiting 20 minutes to speak to the manager, he basically said ""thats too bad.""

I would strongly urge visitors and locals in Tampa to think twice before visiting this restaurant. There are many good restaurants nearby which offer better food and service.",1,A,The Metro Restaurant & Lounge,The Metro Restaurant & Lounge,Th3 M3tro R3staurant & Loung3,1.0

"This is only my second experience eating at a Columbian restaurant,  so bear with me as I learn more about the food and what to order.
I ordered the combination plate which came with a salad, a big mound of white rice, a corn cake, a grilled hanger steak, plantains, a chorizo sausage and what looked like a blood sausage, but wasn't.
Ok, like I said I need to learn how to order, next to me were beautiful shrimp and specialty rice, on the other side some yummy looking cheese dish.
First all my food was great and well prepared. The restaurant itself is beautiful with wall murals and homemade pottery. I dined with a table of fellow YELPER'S,  so that is always fun.
My expectations were off about the Columbian food. I expected the sausages to be spicy or have some kick and that just wasn't on my plate. The salad and rice were naked...no toppings or dressings. There is nothing wrong with this, once again my expectations were nust plain wrong. 
I enjoyed the  meats and nice caramelized plantains very much. Personally I felt the naked rice and salad were a waste as I never eat them like that. I am learning about Columbian food and learned  last night from my fellow YELPER'S things that will help me in ordering better choices the next time.
The restaurant is great and I heard no complaints from anyone about their food.  Unfortunately due to my lack of knowledge and poor ordering, I have to take away a star. I am quite sure on a return visit I will be able to give that extra star.

The other Chinese dishes were prepared more in an Americanized version than a traditional Chinese way.

"Super slow service, but really good food.

Sometimes it is a trade off - a restaurant has amazing food but terrible service. Depending on my mood, I'll take food over service. Here is one of those places where I can forgive slow service.

SERVICE - might as well get the negative out of the way to begin with. If there is a line of people ordering, it will take a long time. I think this is partially the people ordering and partially the employees. Turns out if you are dining in they will bring you a menu and take your order from the table. However, we didn't know that until we got in line after sitting at the table for at least ten minutes perusing the menu and the woman at the cash register told us she would come to us. We ordered water but didn't get it until the meal came. We also ordered a side of sweet potato (for the two year old in our party) once the food came (mom forgot to do so when we placed our order) and it took a long time to get it. We actually thought they forgot. If you dine in, just expect this to be a long meal.

FOOD - This is where they shine. Like I read in other reviews, the oxtail is amazing. I got the large because I didn't want to miss out on more meat. Funny enough, the dishes come with plantains and cabbage and you can choose between two different types of rice. I thought it was choose plantains or cabbage so I asked for cabbage. My friend thinking the same thing asked for plantains. We got a really weird look from the server which I understood later when I realized our mistake. Everything was delicious! I'm a fan of fattier meats to the oxtail was superb. The Jamaican rice and the cabbage was also really good. It's quite a bit of food for a pretty cheap price. 

ATMOSPHERE - It is a small place, but it seems like during the week day most people are ordering take out so I never saw an issue with anyone wanting a seat. It is definitely a hole in the wall, but that adds to the charm. 

Overall I think this place is great. I'll definitely be coming back.",16,B,Jamaica Jamaica Island Cuisine,Jamaica Jamaica Island Cuisine,Jamaica Jamaica Island Cuisine Inc.,5.0

"Enjoi Sweets is one of my favorite food trucks. I love the design of it and of course their delicious cupcakes. They have catered a few events I have been to and I have to say they serve one of the best cupcakes I have ever had. They also will occasionally make Italian sodas that are delicious as well - I enjoyed one on the HOTTEST day of my life: The World's Largest Food Truck Rally EVER I at the Florida State Fairgrounds last August.

They tend to travel all over town and are team players in the food truck world, which is nice because small businesses really need each others support. They'll post photos of them helping out a fellow trucker whose tire is out and the other truckers do the same. Local restaurants should take some notes from how food truckers treat each other.

Prices are also affordable for a food truck and also for serving a dessert. If people have preferences they can call orders ahead, and sometimes when hanging out at a food truck rally I will literally see someone take a box filled with cupcakes...the so called ""cupcake fiends"" haha.

One thing I really like about this truck is how nice the owners are. Sometimes I block up their window because we are just chatting away haha.

"To be frank, my rating could be a reflection of expectations not met, as much as it represents important aspects of my dining experience that disappointed. It is important to keep in mind that Bern's considers and promotes itself to be one of the top steakhouses in the Country. By that standard, my experience falls far short. 

The first of two major disappointments relates to the accommodation given to patrons who's dress fell far short of the the restaurant's dress code. Among other things, the Code clearly states that blue jeans are not appropriate and that those wearing such clothing may be seated in the lobby, as opposed to a dining room. However, nearly one half of the people seated in our dining room, and others that were seated in other dining rooms, were wearing jeans. This blatant lack of adherence and enforcement of the dress code diminishes the experience for those patrons who respect the dress code and positions Bern's as a restaurant no more special than Outback Steakhouse. 

Ambiance - here the restaurant earns the highest of ratings. The reception area, though small, conveys opulence. The restaurant is divided into many rooms of various dimensions. Each room is well appointed and elegant. 

Service - both of our servers (dinner and dessert is served separately in different rooms) earned high marks. They were both pleasant and attentive.

Food/Entree- the menu is heavily weighted to steaks. However, there are other options of interest such as rack of lamb. My wife ordered a 6 oz filet and I a 14oz Delmonico (both Medium). The steaks are accompanied by a small bowl of French Onion soup, a house salad, a baked potato and mixed vegetables. The soup, salad, baked potato and veggies were excellent. The steaks? Average, at best. My steak tasted great, but was not tender in the least. In fact, I have had Delmonico/Rib Eyes at chain restaurants that were as good or better. 

Food/Dessert - served on the second floor of the restaurant, the dessert portion of the meal was everything and more of what you might hope for. The individual dining areas, the piped in live music and the desserts all add up to a must do experience. I had the pineapple upside down cake, which was very good. 

If you live in the Tampa area and are looking for a great steak, my recommendation would be Jesse's in Brandon. The ambiance is lacking, but it is a great value and an excellent steak.",25,B,Bern's Steak House,Bern's Steak House,Bern's Steak House Inc.,3.0

"Sunny Pizza recently opened next door to the International Boba House. The location has seen some turnover, but here is hoping that this pizza place will stick! The owner is really friendly and creative. 

My first time there I ordered the San Francisco Sourdough pizza which has that slight sour taste that a bread bowl would have with cheese and tomato sauce loaded on top. Speaking of tomato sauce, the tomato sauce is made fresh in-house and you can taste the real tomatoes in the sauce.

They have Jarritos Mexican soda which is basically my fave soda. Supposedly they also have a drink they make with a mix of Jarritos and Coconut milk. Like I said the owner is really creative, reminds me of the Cupcake Cache on Busch Boulevard or Revolution Ice Cream in Brandon.

Today I tried the Chicago Pizza with chicken, sausage, onions, mushrooms, and olives. It was quite tasty and the crust was toasted perfectly. The fresh tomato sauce was poured on-top of the pie. It was as filling as I'm accustomed to for a Chicago pizza, but did not leave me feeling like I overindulged afterwards, which almost never happens when I eat Chicago Pizza.

   ---   ---   ---

I really love Oxford Exchange.

And I really loved OE Market.

But this new Mexican theme is just.... rough. Here's how it works:

As we're used to know with a lot of taco/burrito places, you pick the type of tortilla, the protein, and the veggies in a 3-step process.

One problem right off the bat is that only the most sophisticated produceista would know what the ingredients are, and what they taste like. I'm a pretty darn adventurous eater, so it's not so much the mystery, but more that I have absolutely no idea what any of these items are. A brief description on the menu board would go a long way. Here's the current process without menu descriptions:

-Walk up to counter

-Have absolutely no idea what you want because the menu is confusing

-Ask the girl behind the counter about 2-3 ingredients

-Feel unsatisfied as you still want to ask about several more items, but don't want to be that dumb that you don't know basically all of the items

-Feel pressured to hurry up and make a decision

-Eventually make a choice, albeit rushed and uninformed

So the ordering process isn't great, and I'm sure the employees get tired of defining what ""Ancho Creme"" and ""Bustered Shishitos"" are. But how's the food?

Maybe combining the preceding two ingredients with pork in a corn tortilla was a bad choice? But this was probably the worst tasting meal I've had in at least two months. Unfortunately, the flour tortilla was no better.

I just don't get the angle unfortunately. It's near UT, so they want to appeal to college kids... but the menu says hoity-toity. Still, the tacos are affordable at $3-$4, so I guess that makes sense. What doesn't make sense are the $10-$12 juices that are still being sold here. I tried one because, well, I figured a $12 juice had to be pretty amazing. Instead, it was unfortunately the opposite. Kind of watery, and hard to finish. I would have felt that I overpaid at $2.

I also tried the Panang curry and a potato curry which were excellent. The egg rolls were fresh, and the barbecue ribs were very moist and tasty.

I walked into a new, clean, and fairly empty brewery around 2:30 on a Tuesday and was greeted by a friendly and chill bartender named Mike. I asked about happy hour times and he said they didn't have that set-up yet (a bummer and the only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars) but he did offer me a ""locals"" discount which was very generous. I ordered a flight based on Mike's recommendations and was blown away by the beer. The red ale was excellent but what really took the cake was the ""Champagne Wishes and Caviar Dreams."" It weighs in at a whopping 7% but is as light and fluffy as a light domestic beer or unsurprisingly, a dry champagne. I ordered a pint of that after I downed the flight and my total was $15 before the locals discount. The food looked good but I was on a liquid diet at the time so I did not indulge. I will be back.

The soups were very good, including hot & sour, one of my test dishes for evaluating Chinese restaurants.   On some nights they have crab claws at an upcharge rate, and noticed some patrons gorging on them without much other food.

The Verdict:

THE BURGER WAS SO GOOD. Homemade, cooked just right, nice fresh produce and a grilled bun...oh yes. yesssss.

Mozz sticks were awesome, marinara very good. The stick was ample and filled with no shortage of cheese. Yummy & hit the spot. Apparently, Mozz sticks are pretty easy to  screw up in my experiences.

Sweet Pot fries were delish.

The batter was light & flaky with the onion cooked with the right amount of texture & flavor. My friend & I order the battered string beans & egg rolls. We enjoyed the string beans more than the egg rolls but funny I liked the mini salad that cane with the egg rolls. It was crisp, sweet, & refreshing. I order a mango mojito & wasn't impressed by the taste or flavor of it. I've definitely had better & expected more in this area.

"I have been shopping at DRIP, aka Gunn Hwy, Purely Vapor since I started vaping a year and half ago. My husband and I live not even a mile away and it would be the best pick for a close by shop for us to shop at.I've been inside the store and shopped probably at least 20 times in the year and a half and absolutely EVERYTIME I GO I REGREAT IT. 
My husband and I only get absolute attitude when we go there or insulted.
Really does suck that we are treated so bad because vaping for us is a hobby not a need. 
We probably spend at least $1200.00 a month on vape gear. Yea, I know that's insane but we buy starter vapor its & products for close friends and family so that they can experience the free smoke life as well. 
But not only do they loose all of my biz they have lost my respect as well.
Plus all the people I get to start vaping, I don't send there to shop either.
Yes, the new look of the place is really nice and looks like a great place to chill, but I am past  the point of trying that again.
The employees working there are just smart asses, & would pick on me and make fun of me because I would buy vape pens from there uummm... Another time I went there to buy a coil building kit, and I was asking if they had a OHM reader and the worker there said uhhh duh all mods read OHms. OK? Then went back to chatting with his buddys that were hanging out in there. 
I drive 30 minutes to go to VAPOR RISING ON FLORIDA AVENUE. THEY ARE SIMPLY THE BEST AND OLDEST IN TAMPA.

Always crispy and never lacking in the flavor department. Another go to is the chicken lo mein. This is one dish I always feel the need to order. The chicken is delicious and the lo mein is perfectly coated in the right amount of sauce. My husband usually goes for the chicken and broccoli. We eat a lot of chicken, can you tell? Haha!

"Stopped in for lunch earlier this week when a class unexpectedly canceled (yay for a leisurely lunch!). Since I was there right after they opened, it was only myself and one other customer, though I watched many people come and go as I sat and ate.
It seemed a little dark in the restaurant, but there was a lot of natural light coming in through the windows, as one entire side of the place is floor to ceiling glass. Still, the lack of overhead light felt like I came in early before they were really ready to open. I know, I know, it's weird. 

Anyway, I ordered the BBQ bowl (spinach, brown rice, onions, cheese, and black beans with steak. It was a bit pricier than I expected it to be at $17, but I suppose that higher quality food will be more expensive - and there are cheaper options, should meat not be what you're looking for.
I found this bowl to be pretty large and filling. I would have only eaten half and saved the rest for later if I wasn't spending the afternoon in a classroom. All that to say that the portions do seem big enough to break into smaller meals if desired. There was A LOT of spinach and onion in my bowl, and I felt like I tasted those flavors for the rest of the day. It was mildly off-putting, but maybe that wouldn't have been the case had I poured the BBQ sauce on the food instead of using it as a dip.

The menu shows that they also serve salads and wraps, which look delicious as pictured, in addition to soups, smoothies, and juices. I definitely want to try a salad next time I stop in.
All ingredients are clearly listed, which is a plus for me, as I'm still working on navigating the eating-out scene as a gluten-free eater.

"Yelpers rejoice: a father and son are running a hole-in-the-wall that takes something familiar (pizza) with an unfamiliar twist. We eat this stuff up. Literally.

Detroit-style pizza may be new to Tampa, so I'll break it down like a cheap import: you start with the crust on the bottom, of course, but after that everything's reversed. Toppings go directly onto the crust, followed by so much cheese that it flows out to the edge of the pan and dies a delicious crispy death. Tomato sauce goes on top.

We went for the $12 dinner deal: a 1-topping large pizza, which feeds 3-4 people who aren't pizza hogs like I am, with an order of garlic breadsticks and a 2-liter bottle of soda. The guy behind the counter (the son in the father-and-son team) heard us talking about how I drink diet cola and she drinks Mountain Dew, and offered to split it into two cans. Absurd unless you're us; it was actually more valuable split up like that. Smart business move.

The breadsticks, even topped with cheese for an extra 50 cents, weren't particularly Detroity; they give Pokey Stix a run for their money, though. The pizza, which we also split up (half pepperoni, half mushroom -- and yeah, they only count that as one topping, not two), was distinctly better than most pizza I've eaten in Tampa. (Atlantans will recognize it as similar to Jagger's.) 

Again with the thoughtful: the one-man band running Pizza Squared separated the toppings so neatly that I didn't eat a shred of pepperoni, and defied Detroit tradition to put the mushrooms on top so I'd know which side was mine. Very helpful, and btw not completely unfortunate looking either, if anyone wants to play Who Wants To Marry a Cute Pizzeria Operator Who Also Plays in a Band That Sometimes Rehearses in the Aforementioned Pizzeria. (If you're taken, sir, or not marriage-minded, my apologies. I try to mention ALL the charms of a business.)

You'll drive past Pizza Squared the first time because it's in a little strip mall south of Fowler, across from the Yuengling bottling plant, and you'll be paying attention to the traffic cones (probably a good choice). That's okay. Turn around and come back. Next time you won't drive past it without stopping.",35,C,Pizza Squared,Pizza Squared,pizza squared,5.0

"I Love Tropical Smoothie because it is not only delicious lunch or light dinner but is so healthy.  They have locations in Brandon and Downtown Tampa.  I love the Mango Magic and that is usually my go to smoothie on the run. I also like the kiwi Quencher and the Strawberry Limeade.  I usually get a smoothie with the Turkey Bacon Ranch.  Smoothie and half a sandwich.  I also love to get a smoothie right after a run or a workout in the gym like the Island Green which is delish and good for recovery from working out.

The reason I rate it a 4 and not a 5 is that the shops have different owners and none of the programs are the same so you have to remember which shop gave you which reward card or is having a special and that just gets to be a bit much and to confusing.",18,B,Tropical Smoothie Cafe,Tropical Smoothie Cafe,Tr0pical Sm00thie Cafe,4.0

Luckily we only had to wait about 15 minutes . Everything tasted great !! I will definitely come back ! They have some awesome prices as well !

"My gf received a gift card for here, and its been well over 20yrs since my last crappy experience here.... 

Well they did not disappoint. Yet again. We came in while it was raining and the place was not very crowded at all. There were two hostesses at the kiosk and one person waiting in front of us. 

We still waited for close to 3-4minutes even tho the two hostesses did not seem to be busy at all. 

We were seated and had to wait over 10min for one of the hostesses to come to our table. I guess they were doing double duty tonight. She took our drink order and we waited another 10ish minutes. 
They had a vampire drink that was only $1. 
It said it had rum in it. We did not taste any. But they were sweet enough, and were only $1. So.... 

In the time we were waiting for our server two more groups were seated. They got their drinks just as slow. 
Oddly they got their appetizers at the same time ours came out. 20min wait for us... maybe 5-10min for theirs. Then another 10min for another $1 faux rum drink for my gf. I was supposed to get another water but never did. 
By now we've been here about 45-50 and our food came out. At least it was hot and sizzling. 
We got the bourbon street chicken and shrimp. It tasted good. That was a plus at least. We ate and our waitress never came back to check on us. 

Not sure how many tables she had, but she was not on top of her game anyways. Very slow service and forgot my refill my water. I ended up drinking my gf's water anyway. The people behind us were complaining as well about the service. 

I let my gf know not to accept anymore gift cards for here in the future. 

Weak drink special.pretty sure no alcohol was in it. 
Ok-ish boneless wings. The asian sauce saved them. 
Good main course.

"I was looking forward to finally trying Sidebern's. I have been in Tampa for over 6 years and still hadn't tried it, can you believe it? Well, out of a whim 4 of us decided to go on a Tuesday night. The first impression was great; the hostesses were friendly and showed us to a very comfortable and private table. Loved the décor and the simplicity yet warmth of the main restaurant. 

With this being said, the rest of the experience was meh! The server seemed rush even though there were only 5 to 6 tables and took the drink order by piecemeal. Some of us ordered the tasting menu, while others ordered a la carte, this after the kitchen approved that not all of us would order from the tasting menu. My choices faired well, while my guests labeled some courses ""an epic fail"". I ordered the Trofie Pasta which was outstanding; then I had the Boar which was salty, dry, and terrible. Overall a mixed bag... Service got better over time but definitely not out of this world. I would give this restaurant another try, see if there are any other plates as wonderful as the Pasta.

Pizza was thin and perforated with a taste of store bought crust. While the sausage was great, the sauce and crust were not what I would consider pizza.  On top of that, it was cut into squares.  In my experience, a hallmark of chain pizza places.  Having seen all these positive reviews I was anticipating at least a decent pie but sadly that was not the case.

"Let me start by saying I signed up for Yelp just to leave this review because we had never had an experience like this before. I wonder if the owners even know what goes on in this restaurant & if so how do they remain in business. 

We arrived around 5pm & there was no one in the restaurant. Probably should've been our first clue but we figured people were on their way to evening church or spending it with family since it was a holiday weekend. We Were given the standard chips & salsa in which the salsa was quite bland. Ordered the cheese dip & it was ok. Ordered dinner then visited the restroom & it was an absolute mess (women's was fine but husband said the mens was trashed) quite surprising since there was no one there. They had the typical Mariachi music playing but had turned it off. We told them not o turn it off on our account so it came back on. Then they apparently couldn't find a song to their liking as they continued to start & stop the music. THEN (this is when it got unbelievable) once we received out food the music changed to what one could call gangster rap. The explicit songs that used the ""f"" word & the ""n"" word & specific sexual positions was now being blared over the whole restaurant. When we asked our server who thought the music was appropriate, he was about as clueless as they come. He was at best 17 or 18 & probably in the position to where he had to just do as he was told. Then he said he would have them change it. So the music went back to what one can expect while dining in a Mexican restaurant. When my husband questioned a member at the bar who the DJ was,... a little round guy said he was, so my husband asked why he thought the music was appropriate & his response was ""you didn't like it?""  I'm not sure why or how they thought the music was appropriate but it goes well beyond any boundary of questionable good business & proper customer service. 

By the way the food was ok but certainly not anything spectacular. Only reason we will remember this restaurant is because of the travesty that they assumed was ok.",16,B,Estela's,Estela's,estela's,1.0

"I don't know why I randomly decided to stop by this place on my way home, I guess the ""vegan options"" sign outside intrigued me because I've been wanting to try more vegan things recently. I didn't even know what kind of a restaurant this was (now I know it's middle eastern) but a young man was very helpful and bought me into the restaurant and gave me the menu to look at. 

The restaurant was completely empty (which usually I would run a mile) but I decided to look at the menu anyways. I didn't understand what any of it was and I was going to turn and walk out, but the young man helped me a lot and was very knowledgeable and friendly which put me at ease and explained what everything was and asked what kind of food I liked etc. I went with the ""Shawarma"" which is ""Young boneless chicken marinated and cooked slowly on a vertical grill"". (Not vegan at all but whatever lol)  I got it in a pita bread. 

I did not check my food before I left the restaurant but I wish I did because I did not realize that not only was it the chicken, but a bunch of tomatoes, cucumbers and mushrooms (which I hate) so that kind of annoyed me that not anywhere on the menu, or was I told that was going to be inside. So I had to scoop all of that away and then eat. Honestly I didn't love the taste, it tasted very strongly of turmeric to me. I most likely won't be back here mainly because I just don't think it's the type of food I'm into.

The restaurant itself was spacious, a lot of seating. I can't compare it to any other middle eastern restaurants as this is the first one I've ever been to but they had a lot of hummus on the menu if you like hummus!

"Being on a low carb diet kind of sucks... no rice, no noodle, no beans, none of the usual dessert choices, lol! And there are really very few places to go out to where you can just order something and enjoy it without substituting a lot of the flavor away.

I messaged Banh Mi House a couple of days ago about low carb options, and Ahn L (owner) said no problem... do a salad bowl with no noodles or rice.

So tonight we went to Banh Mi House! And will be back, hopefully often! The staff is wonderful, friendly and very helpful (even to the point of them reading some labels to find us the lowest carb salad dressing that they had, which I did not even ask them to do. They just did it! Awesome, right?)

Food... we (my girlfriend and I shared a bowl of Beef Pho (no noodles) and it was very tasty. You could taste the broth, and the various spices that make it good Pho! 

We both had the grilled pork bowls with a salad base, and they were huge. Very fresh crunchy veggies, tasty pickled veggies (very fresh and tart / sweet), and lots of meat and salad. So good! The fish sauce that was served to top it was delicious... a good balance of flavors. The other dressing they brought us was also yummy, and an excellent counterpoint to the fish sauce.

If you like Vietnamese food... you will like it here! If you have not had Vietnamese food, you owe it to yourself to try it.. and I do recommend Bahn Mi House as a place to start.

"I would absolutely recommend this restaurant. My biggest tip? Stick with the seafood.

Our waiter, Raymond, was great. Quite attentive without being constantly involved in our conversation. My water was magically filled without me noticing, which is exactly how it should be. He also had great recommendations throughout the menu which was helpful. Bravo for the service.

We had the crab cake for an appetizer. This was hands down one of the best crab cakes I've ever had. When they say there's no filler, there's honestly no filler. It was fantastic. 

I ordered the sea bass which was wonderful. Steamed perfectly Hong Kong style in a light soy broth that wasn't too overpowering the way some soy sauces have a tendency of being. It was well paired. We had Broccolini and the Truffles Mac and Cheese as sides. I would recommend both, but I'd probably try a different veggie next time. It was great, but not spectacular. Mac and Cheese is a definite yes.

My husband had the Tamahawk steak which was amazing to look at. What a statement. While it was cooked a perfect medium-rare, (a difficult task for a steak that large, kudo's to the chef) and looked like it would taste amazing, there are other places in town to get steak which, in my opinion, are better. I'd rather spend the $70 at Bern's and get a fantastic piece of meat than $70 here and it be passable.

The Godiva Chocolate Cake and Ice Cream was yummy, but I'd try something different next time. It's a great chocolate cake (and large enough to share) but kindof typical. 

We had a night cap at the bar and listened to a jazz trio. They were great. I'd come back just for a late night cocktail and music any night.

Let me just start off by saying I am no Mexican food critique but I do take great pride in the fact that I lived in San Diego for 3 years and had the luxury and convenience of always having a taco shop within a half mile radius and took full advantage. Thus I know fresh Mexican and THIS IS FRESH and seems to be pretty authentic! Almost close to San Diego and Tijuana! 
The steak taco was incredible, but they didn't put any pico or guacamole on it like I'm used to. 
Priced accordingly and very good customer service. Service is quick and the restaurant is very very clean. 
When I was ordering, I saw a delivery man from what seemed to be like an Uber eats company picking up an order so that's pretty cool that they offer this service. Otherwise, not a soul was in the place which is extremely unfortunate. More people need to discover this amazing little taco joint you will be glad you did!!!!",27,B,Tacos 4G,Tacos 4G,Tacos Go,5.0

He inspires me and challenges me to work to achieve my goal. 

As well they have a wide range of choices and all the food is healthy, easy and delicious. I have a very busy schedule and to have healthy food to eat is nice

After you decide what you want you tell them at the counter, and they have everything packages all up nicely for you.  They also have cute little tea sets, raw sugar, and hot tea to enjoy while you're there! 

My favorites are: Luminscent Tea (white tea) and the Sun Kissed Green Tea also love the Immunitea when you feel a cold catching on

I also got the orange creamsicle tea, but didn't love it.  If you like black tea, try the almond biscotti tea!!! Yum!

"Almost couldn't find this place as there is not a lot of signage out front, but I'm glad I ventured inside. 

Ordered the roasted garlic and feta spread, which came with warm pita bread, and the dolmades (rice wrapped in grape leaves). The dolmades were delicious, the grape leaves fragrant and the rice perfectly cooked. 

The real star was the garlic and feta spread, paired harmoniously with pita bread. The pitas were warm, light, and delicious. We cleaned the bowl and considered skipping the main course and ordering another. 

I had the chicken & pancetta sandwich with sundried tomatoes and pesto aioli on toasted Italian bread as my main course. The bread was tasty and appropriately toasted, but was too heavy for the sandwich. The pancetta was crispy and delicious. The chicken was a bit on the dry side. The pesto aioli was unevenly spread, heavily concentrated on one half of the sandwich. 

Prices were average for fare and the area. The food was prepared quickly and presented in an upscale fashion. Our server was attentive and efficient. She was passionate about the menu and was happy to recommend her favorite items.

Before I get into the pizza, I want to say this class trip was interesting. They could see what goes into making a pizza. 
With that said, the pizza itself was not that great. The sample pizza was kinda weird. The crust was like mushy and salty and they put yellow cheese on a pepperoni pizza. I would never get a take out pizza from here. I make pizza EASILY at home. I buy the dough for 2.65 from Publix and make an AWESOME pizza.

Another amazing item for purchase are the orchids.  I am stunned each time I see $6, $8, and $10 stickers on them.  Mom's collection has grown much larger at those prices.  They seem to come in all shapes and colors.

The rest of the fare is amazing and cheap as well.  LARGE bowls of soup, stuffed to-go boxes of all manner for only $5?!  No wonder I see people walking out with grocery-sized bags of food.

"Mixed feelings about this place, but ultimately landed on 2 stars as a reflection of the entire experience.

First comment - DO NOT try to wear shorts into the main dining room, no matter how nice those shorts may be. You will not get in the door, even if you're with a large group that has a reservation.

The bar area is rather small, so if you miss out on a chair, don't plan on grabbing a drink while you wait for a table. You'll have servers, bussers, managers, and diners bump into repeatedly, no matter where you stand.

It's loud. And the tables are very close to each other. Not what I would recommend for a nice date, celebration, or family dinner. It's just too loud and has zero element of intimate fine dining. If that's not what they're trying to deliver, then they succeeded.

My table received outdated menus, expect for one person, which forced us to have to rethink our orders. How hard is it to collect paper printed menus and dispose of them during closing? We also did not receive a wine list until we requested one.

First courses were not delivered at the same time. We were not an uncommon party size, but one person finished their first course before others received theirs due to the delay.

Main courses came out without any of the sides or sauces. We had to request them after everyone had been served, by which time some of us said forget it, even though we had ordered them.

I ordered the 12oz filet, medium, expecting it to come out closer to medium rare, which it did, however, a steakhouse at this level should not need recalibrated ordering on a classic steak. Char was good, tenderness was there, but the sauce helped add some otherwise lacking flavor.

Oh, I forgot to mention that the glass of wine I ordered when seated was not brought out until I reminded the waiter about it.

I've been to plenty of high end steakhouses and I'm so conflicted on the quality of this one because of the expectations I had in my own mind of a fine dining experience. It wasn't fine dining. It was expensive dining with quality meat. If that's what you want, you won't be disappointed.

"I visited Floridian Palace Hotel last night for drinks and food before heading out for Friday night. The food was excellent - the chef is definitely doing a great job there.

The place is deserted though and it probably has more to do with service.

The bartender in the hotel was deplorable. He was pompous and rude to our party. It took nearly 30 minutes to get his attention to make my drink and there were only 6 people in the entire bar area.

He never asked how our checks would be split and didn't want to separate the bill when we wanted to close out. Then he wanted to put the whole tab on the lady in our party. 

After complaining he had the manager split one persons check and then refused to split the other and I lost my patience there.

On top of that, he clearly had a problem with people speaking English to him and would only respond to people speaking to him in Spanish. I find that completely inappropriate for a hotel that should service people with hospitality. This is America buddy.

The restaurant has a really cool beach-vibe, it's supposed to look like an old surf shop and there's bumper stickers everywhere. You actually order inside and pick up your order at the outside window.

My go-tos are their salads, they're amazing and surprisingly filling. I usually do the Paddleboard Power Salad and add chicken. Their Kale Caesar Gulf Shrimp salad is yummy too. I've also tried a couple of their flatbreads, you can't go wrong either way. Last time I got the Spicy Chipotle Cheddar flatbread and it was very tasty. They also have a fridge with a variety of fresh cold-pressed juices, lemonade, coffee, and immunity shots.

"When I'vs visited other big cities in recent years -- Seattle, Brooklyn, Atlanta -- I wondered when someone would open a coffee shop/bar with a solid menu and great aesthetics in little old Tampa. Enter King State.

Like many people, I first visited because King State's roasted coffee is a favorite and...let's be real, I wanted to check out the reportedly Instagram-worthy space for myself. I was shocked at how good the food was.

Order the grits and I promise you won't regret it. If you aren't much of a coffee person, try the iced white tea.",37,C,King State,King State,King State,5.0

"Wow, this is one of those times that I wish I had paid attention to the Yelp reviews before stepping foot into this AYCE American Chinese buffet.  China Pearl SUPER Buffet is located along N. Dale Mabry Highway right before the bridge carrying you over the railroad tracks and Busch Boulevard, and then before the traffic light at Linebaugh Avenue.

From the outside the restaurant is modeled to look like a cheery Asian temple with lots of blues, reds, and golds, and there is a large parking lot to handle the swarms of walking dead Wal-Creatures who decide to stop here. 

My first clue that this was destined to be a forgettable meal was the fact there were only 5 tables of people inside of the restaurant, and that none of these people were Asian. After surveying the crowd I realized that there were some important differentiators between me and the rest of these people:

#1  I have a pulse. 

#2  I was not wearing pajama bottoms and flip flops.

#3  I was not shoveling the food into my mouth without chewing.

There are three food stations set up to one side of the restaurant. The first, closest to the wall, had wilted salad fixings, fruit, pudding, Jell-O, and sheet cakes. At the far end of this table was the sushi -- primarily California rolls, and pieces of nigiri that had been sitting out so long that the fish had actually turned a gray color. YUM!!!!

The second and third stations were set up as steam tables. This was the usual collection of soup pots, fried rice, Asian noodles, crab Rangoon, greasy egg rolls, fried chicken fingers, and deep-fried mystery meals.

One small problem -- there were no heated water baths under the buffet pans to keep the food steaming warm. Instead, everything sat under heat lamps until it was devoid of any moisture.....or flavor. Everything looked as though it had been fried in oil. The food tasted greasy, and salty, and was just a notch above room temperature.

I will say that the servers were very pleasant, and quick to refill my Diet Coke, and for that this restaurant has earned one star. Next time I'll avoid going here and therefore no longer need the the post-meal bottle of Kaopectate. I'll just visit the drive-thru at KFC instead.",35,C,China Pearl Super Buffet,China Pearl Super Buffet,China P3arl Sup3r Buff3t,1.0

"What really stood out about this place for me, is how they are known for their vegan options. The restaurant itself doesn't look like much when you enter but the idea of having a vegan Vietnamese restaurant is interesting and worth exploring.

I will say the food was beyond my expectations. All the green and vegetables tasted fresh and the colors were so vibrant, since the rolls are see through. Also the edamame noodles tasted just like normal noodles, which is always impressing to see fruits or vegetables imitate other foods we're more used to eating. However, the pork, duck and mushrooms did not taste fresh. The food came out relatively quick which makes me think that it's not made to order. The mushrooms were chewy, probably because they're over cooked. The pork and duck was bone dry, if you didn't add sauce then swallowing will be difficult 

Overall it was an interesting experience for me, but if you visit I would recommend to stick with the full vegan options.",40,C,Bamboozle Cafe,Bamboozle Cafe,Bamboozle Cafe Inc.,4.0

Service isn't the best because I've had some pretty bad service here and was embarrassed many of times with my guests.

When we arrived at 6 pm on Friday the restaurant was almost full. By the time we left it was completely full. I made the reservation six days in advance and couldn't find reservation for Saturday night.
I like the atmosphere and the vibes of Olivia. One thing I must say it's pretty loud. We looked around and almost all the people around our table, were basically screaming to hear each other. Dining here 2.5 weeks after a vocal cords surgery was a bit tough for my voice.

Our waitress Jamie was nice and she recommended us few dishes.
Jamie asked if we would like a basket of the focaccia, of course we said yes.it was delicious. 

I started with the Spritz and Giggles. I thought it was a bit diluted so I asked Jamie to add more Aperol and Prosecco. It came back much better. Just right! 

For appetizer we had the polenta fries with red sauce. It was good. I give it three stars.
We ordered the margarita pizza- five stars.

"I was stranded in the area getting my car worked on and the reason why I decided to squat here for a few hours was because they have free Wi-Fi and I had some work to get done. It must have been a sign, because the food and service are also great. As you may deduced from the name, it's a burger joint... but not just any burger joint. They specialize in the ""Guiness Burger"" where they infuse Guiness beer into the burger. Genius? I think so.

So I ordered the Piggyback Burger -- regular beef burger topped with pulled pork, cole slaw, lettuce and tomato. Since it was my first time, I asked if I could sub-in the Guiness beef patty and they happily obliged. I chose curly fries to accompany my burger. The burger sas great despite the fact that is was cooked well-done when I requested Medium. The Guiness added a unique depth of flavor while the pulled pork and cole slaw gave it that deep southern comfort feel. It's just a well constructed burger. The curly fries were the perfect complement -- super crispy and well seasoned. I would definitely come back here for a burger.

Overall, the great food combined with the excellent service makes this a fantastic place. The free Wi-Fi was just the cherry on top.

"Oooookay, so I know on my tagline it says proud carbivore and glutenarian, so clearly I don't do gluten-free. However, as a dessert enthusiast I do not discriminate and am willing to try anything dessert related. I was also very intrigued to know that their products are vegan as well, and as someone who ""dabbles"" in veganism, I knew I had to give this place a try. I've had the pleasure of trying some of their goods before, such as banana muffins and truffles that Jem's Café carried, and they were very good. The thing about this place is that they're not just gluten-free, their also allergen free of virtually all the common ingredients in food allergies such as eggs, nuts, dairy, as well as wheat and gluten, among others. The past two visits I've paid was for their special ""Allergen Free Dessert Night"" where they had extended hours and special menu items. Thus far, I've had their strawberry hand pie (which is a pop tart basically), their special pineapple cake slice, and two of their orange drop cookies (which is an everyday offering). Although the strawberry tarts were a little pricey (about $8 for two because one is not enough), I really enjoyed it and would order this product again. The crust was perfectly thick and flaky, but soft to chew and the strawberry filling not overly sugary and I could really taste the real fruit in it. It was topped with strawberry frosting and die free sprinkles which gave it a nice touch of childish whimsy. I was only disappointed that all I got was just the two poptarts, so I was ecstatic when they had another Allergen Free dessert night. This time I was in a bit of a predicament because I wasn't sure what to get. Birthday cake cupcakes and brownie sundae or pineapple cake??? (two of their specials). So after going back and forth on what to choose, I decided to go with something different (because I always default to birthday cake) and get the pineapple cake slice. Oh was I glad I picked this! This is probably my favorite item I've gotten from them for a few reasons. First off, if nobody told me, I never would have guessed there were no milk, eggs, or gluten like its traditional counterpart. I half expected the cake to be crumbly and have a somewhat sandy texture as most gluten free items, but for this cake, that was not the case at all.  The cake was very soft and moist as I ran my fork through it. It was a three layer cake that had some pineapple puree holding the layers together. Somehow, the cake was strangely refreshing as pineapple fruit or juice would be, which is normally I would not describe cake. There were no chunks of pineapple as I would have guessed, it was all blended in the cake and puree. It had a light amount of vanilla frosting over it that did balance out the fruity flavor well and the frosting was not overly sweet at all. As a final touch it came with a dye free maraschino cherry which rounded off the cake quite nicely. I plated the cake slice along with two orange drop cookies. The cookies were short bread with a slight hint of citrus, but they were moist and cake like. They were topped with a drop of orange icing. Customer service is outstanding too. The girl behind the counter was nice enough to take two of the orange cookies out of the half dozen box because I REALLY wanted TWO cookies to go with the cake (I'm somewhat OCD about that). The best part was I didn't feel like I was going to slip into a carb and sugar coma by the time I was done and didn't feel sick despite all the sweets I ate. Now, as tasty as these treats are, hopefully everyone remembers that they are a TREAT, not a health food, and should be treated as a TREAT. It is pleasing to know though that for those who suffer from Celiac Disease or Gluten intolerance (as well as strict vegans), that they have outstanding options and don't have to feel like they're missing out. Word of advice when purchasing these treats: if you don't eat them right away, place in the freezer or they will go bad in as little as two days! I know this because I learned the hard way. They are also a little pricey, but it is comparable to any other specialty dessert shop. I look forward to another visit with them.",20,B,Stacy's Gluten Free Goodies,Stacy's Gluten Free Goodies,St@cy's Gluten Free Goodies,5.0

"An absolute favorite spot of mine in downtown Tampa! They serve breakfast, lunch, and early dinner as well as have a food truck that is present at a variety of different festivals and events around the Tampa Bay Area! I have a few favorite menu items but always look forward to trying different and featured menu options! You can never go wrong with their extensive variety of lobster rolls, which come with 1/4 lb of lobster meat and can be chilled or warm! The rosemary steak sandwich is to die for as well, with marinated steak, Parmesan cheese, sundried tomatoes, and organic greens. I love that their shrimp po'boy is offered with either grilled or fried shrimp for when I'm feeling like being a little healthier! The po'boy comes it's cucumber, sundried tomatoes, organic greens, BACON, and a delicious honey sriracha glaze. Besides having great lobster rolls, they also have a blue crab roll that's very yummy! A have some fantastic vegetarian options. My favorite is their veggie tacos, which come with portobello mushrooms, cucumber, carrots, organic greens, sundried tomatoes, and topped with sriracha mayo. When I'm looking for a smaller bite, my go to's are most definitely their creamy lobster bisque topped with lumps of lobster meat on top and their fried green tomatoes (to die for).

"I have visited the original Davis Islands location and the recently opened South Tampa outpost on El Prado and have had terrific food and service at both.

Everything about this place feels authentic from the very personal, and personable, service to the insanely delicious pastas, sauces and mozzarella.

A friend I was dining with at the El Prado site had been there just the night before and was planning to return for a third consecutive night the day after we ate. It was just a fluke that the first night she was taken there as a spur of the moment decision with her dining companion. Our visit had been planned for a week because we were anxious to try it and a birthday dinner was in order for one member of our party. And the three-peat? Completely her idea as a way to introduce someone else to the restaurant for the first time.

We were given a small plate with olives, roasted veggies, small toasted breads brushed with olive oil and a couple of samples of pasta. Nice touch, selection and presentation. The entrees that were selected were preceded by a delightful but simple salad that provided a satisfying crunch and was accompanied by some tangy dressing.

Our pastas arrived quickly and proved to be very generous servings. The smells from each selection were incredible and the conversation definitely slowed as we went about the serious task of eating.

There was so much flavor we did not want to waste a bite so used the serving of bread that was placed on the plate to carefully soak up sauce and forks to thoroughly scrape each dish clean to capture every morsel as we packed up the uneaten portion for leftovers.

The server was quite helpful and was able to handle some special requests made due to dietary preferences. Note, we were charged a $5 for fee the substitutions requested (just think that should have been mentioned up front rather then showing up on a bill as a charge for marinara).

At the time of our late October visit the new location was still waiting for paperwork to clear so it could sell and serve wine. Until then, guests may bring their own (but may want to check to see if there is a corkage fee).

Some people might be a little put off by the prices but for the quality and quantity of what I was served I have no issue with the cost.

   ---   ---   ---

I tend to choose the vast majority of restaurants that my wife and I patronize, just due to the fact that I spend an inordinate amount of time on Yelp. But this was a rare situation where she presented an option to me that I'd never even heard of. She introduced it to me by showing me the photos on their website, and like her, I was convinced in about five seconds. Within two hours, she was off to pick up our lunch.

We both were quite intrigued by many options on the menu, but I ultimately landed on the Soprano Hoagie. This is definitely not the typical sandwich you picture when you think of Italian cuisine, but it was quite delicious. I also shared (read: ate 85%) of the pastrami and burrata appetizer. Normally the meat would be prosciutto there, but the pastrami surprisingly did not make me miss prosciutto. 

We finished off with the nutella croissant and a loaded cold brew with coconut. All of it was great. And I ate all of it 7 hours ago and am still stuffed. When adding in my wife's caprese (open faced) sandwich and coke, the total came to $80 after tip, so it certainly was not a cheap food truck lunch, but the quality was top notch and I'd absolutely return again.

"Okay, I'm sitting in Sips now.  I was going to give it 4 stars, but then the gentleman behind the counter suggested cupcake syrup in my coffee, and he just got the 5th star.  I haven't been a coffee drinker in a while - the occasional cup every now and then, but I've switched to tea.  After having cupcake syrup in my coffee, I may have to switch back.

If there was one negative I would give, it would have to be the size.  It isn't a big place, so if they are busy, you may have trouble finding a seat.  Also, the size it does have is long (as opposed to wide), so you come in the front door where there is a lot of light, but there's only 2 or 3 tables by the front.  As you head back along the wall, there is less natural light.  Almost none.

However, I am here on a Saturday afternoon and it is not busy.  The tables and chairs are all open, and I was able to grab a comfy dinette set to plant my computer.  Started with an organic english breakfast tea - two tea bags for a large that only cost about $2.00.  Great size for low price.  Couple hours later, I switched to a medium coffee with my cupcake syrup.  Just a whole lotta liquid yummies.

The staff is very friendly and they seem to know everyone.  Kind of wish they were closer to downtown tampa and St. Pete than all the way up here in Carrollwood/Citrus Park, or whatever you call this area, but its nice to know they are here for the occasional time I find myself around here.

This is your standard issue, picture menu, 4 table top, mostly carry-out Chinese joint.  Nothing about the service, food or décor really sets this place apart from any other of its kind.

The chicken wings were seasoned lightly with curry, which made them the runner-up for #1.  The soup was reported by la chica as ""okay.""  I don't eat the stuff, so I dunno.  The orange chicken though, was pretty damn good.  It was a little spicy, as if they mixed the orange sauce with Szechuan.  I'd go back in a pinch for some of that, no doubt.

"Why 4 stars? Because Yelp helped me find another great spot.

   ---   ---   ---

I feel like I've been down just about every major road in Tampa Bay, but as we approached Viva Napoli, it occurred to me that I'd definitely never been on El Prado between Westshore and Dale Mabry before. And this is a prime example for why I'm sure a huge proponent of Yelp - I never would have known this place even existed, but it's been on my local bucket list for several weeks. 

Speaking of that bucket list, I've been trying to check every place off that list that I considered to be of major interest to me. While there's no way I could literally go to every cool looking restaurant in Tampa Bay, I wanted to at least go to all of the ones that struck the ""I've always wanted to go there"" chord with me. Viva Napoli was literally the last place on that list for me, as of mid-April 2019. Of course, that list will always be added to over time, but this dinner representing the completion of something for me. And hopefully it will manifest itself in the form of some saved money and calories in the coming months, without me constantly driven to check out new restaurants. 

Anyway, onto Viva Napoli!

My favorite part of the experience was the service. A man with a thick Italian accent took care of us and the rest of the patrons in the restaurant. I don't believe we saw another employee the entire time, which was incredibly impressive for him to juggle so many tables, while also making us feel like we were in the restaurant alone. His service was impeccable and he reminded us very much of our amazing trip to Italy a couple years prior. 

As for the food, we were not super hungry, so we opted to just split a salad and a pizza - The Greca Napoli salad and the Crudo e Rucola pizza. Both were solid.

I'd probably give the salad a 4.5 and the pizza a 4. I didn't realize when I ordered that this pizza did not have marinara, but that was my fault. I was hypnotized as soon as a I saw prosciutto and just stopped looking. It was still tasty even without the sauce - the crust was seasoned perfectly. 

The building itself smelled like fresh paint - it's obvious that some money was poured into making it as lovely as possible. I have no idea what was here prior, but the paintings of Naples on the wall were such a nice touch.

After we ordered our food the employee got up and went to the kitchen then to the manager. We decided not to eat there paid our bill and left. 

I would NEVER eat at this place and will NEVER go back. I really think it is bad business practice to have your employees drinking and confronting customers at the bar.

"This restaurant has only been open a month so I am baking that into the rating.

PROS:
-Affordable - most items range from $5 to $9
-Friendly staff

CONS:
-Fairly long wait time for lunch service
-Out of both chicken wings and boneless (aka nugggets) wings

LOCATION:
Located in a small strip center on W Kennedy between Habana and Armenia.  Parking is limited on the front side though more is available in the back.

FOOD:
Though ""gyros"" is prominently in the title, they maybe make up one half of the menu choices.  Combo plates and chicken wings fill out most of the rest but there are individual pizza, sub, burger and salad choices, as well.  I intended to order the gyro and chicken wing combo only to learn they were completely out of all their chicken products...odd...so I went with just a gyro/fries/drink combo ($7).

Once the meal was ready, more on that later, I was pleased with the serving portions.  The gyro was on the large side as was the order of fries.  Unfortunately, for the gyro, quantity did not meet quality.  The pita was both stale (dry and a bit brittle) and a little too toasted.  It was noticeable enough to overshadow what were decent innards.  The fries were also well-done but in this case it is how I prefer them and they were seasoned well.   Drinks are only can & bottle soda/water.

With missing chicken and overcooked pita, only 2 Stars for Food.

SERVICE:
On my lunch visit, there were 3 other diners - one with a large to-go order.  I was greeted as soon as I walked in by the single employee behind the counter and he took my order pretty quickly.  However, for a simple gyro and fries the wait time for my food was long for those conscious about their lunch hour.  The service was friendly and polite though.  

On average, 3 for Service.

VALUE:
I think this is the strong point of the visit.  The pizzas, subs, gyros and salads all come in under $7.  The combo plates run from $5.5 - $9.  Wings run form $5.25 (6pcs) to $19.99 (24 pcs).  

Being a little generous size despite the stale bread...4 Stars for Value.

ATMOSPHERE:
This restaurant is long and narrow with just 5 two-top tables so takeout orders are probably the expectation.  It's not much to look at but clean.  

3 Stars for Atmosphere.

Even though I wasn't totally wow'd, I'd probably come back to try the wings and give the gyro another shot.

"The brisket sandwich was saddening. I love the setting. The staff was friendly but ultimately inattentive. The brisket sandwich had great ingredients, but was stringy and dry.

"First of all, very friendly staff! This is the 2nd time I've been here and there's a reason why I came back. Their churros are , specifically the Cookies & Cream Churro. I've tried all of them and that one is the all-time favorite amongst my friends and family. 

If you're looking at the Matcha Pebbles Churro and hoping to get more matcha flavor, you'll be disappointed. It is mainly fruity pebble with matcha glaze. Matcha flavor is very mild and subtle. 

We love the Mangonadas but flavor is not as strong as an authentic one. We also got a few of the drinks and The Pink Flamingo Green Tea is so good! Other drinks like salted cream green tea, strawberry twist, etc. are okay. 

Shaken beef garlic noodles tend to be more on the oily and salty side. If you don't mind the salt and oil or fall in the older Asian cohort population that's very health conscious, then it's definitely a tasty dish to try!",12,A,Hiccups & Churroholic,Hiccups & Churroholic,Hiccups & Churroholic,4.0

"I am sad to say that I think this location is going down hill. This used to be our go-to place for a nice dinner. It isn't cheap but you could consistently expect the food to be high quality and well executed. Not this time. First of all, they remodeled the place and the waiter wanted to tell us all about that. Maybe they are more focused on decor now than the food. I thought it looked fine before and I don't go to restaurants strictly for how they look inside. We always get the bang bang shrimp so we ordered that. I bit into a nice crunchy chunk of shell which has never happened before. Also, you could see some of the shrimp were little bits of shrimp instead of full pieces. Your server used to bring your drinks, now they have separated that out to other staff. It took forever for us to get our draft beer orders each time even though we were 2 feet from the bar. My mom ordered the seared tune steak. It was an oddly shaped piece of tuna (looked like some scrap piece) and to top it off it was not seared (rare in the middle) but completely cooked all the way though, not a trace of red or even pink. My boyfriend got the 'special' snapper and it was 2 oddly shaped end pieces that were thin and just not very good.

"I had a few good meals at the Sam Seltzers back in Orlando before it closed - so I had decent expectations coming to this location in Tampa.  The quality seems to have gone down quite a bit.  The steak is decent and cooked well, but a bit overpriced for the quality of the meat and the cut.  You are getting roadhouse quality steaks at outback prices.  What happened to the rolls laced with garlic butter, now they are just normal rolls... What happened to the seasoning and garlic grilled onto the steak if you would like?  Now it is served begrudgingly after the fact.

I am from out of town so I am not sure if it is the standard for the area or not - but the clientele was a bit trashy.  Lots of mullets and baseball caps in the dining room and it seemed as if the decor was an attempt to make something classy in a wal-mart sort of way.

"I love mall lunch dates. It's kind of our bi-weekly tradition. Me and my guy meet up at the mall, walk around and find junk food to eat. Romance, am I right?! 

I've been eyeing Planet Grilled Cheese since their coming soon wall art was prominently displayed. I love greasy yummy grilled cheese! I finally got my chance! We got there right at their lunch rush time, and we had about 10 customers ahead of us. The workers were efficient and as friendly as one could expect with a million hungry customers staring at them. 

I ordered the buffalo chicken grilled cheese with fries and my fiancé ordered the Mac Daddy with mozzarella sticks. The buffalo could definitely use some ranch, but the fries! You know, if it wasn't for fries I would be super fit. I'm in the gym six days a week. I eat fries most days too. It's a weakness. The fries at Planet Grilled Cheese are the things that dreams are made of if you like crispy favorable fries. I'm sitting here in my jammies daydreaming about the next time I'm coming for fries! The Mac Daddy was pretty great too, and the fiancé and I have made a pact to each get something the other would like to try next time so we can mix and match our selections. 

So after all of this, I deducted a star because the price is ridiculous. I could have went to BJ's, had lunch and tipped for the price of the trip to PGC. Yes, upgrading to meals with mozzarella sticks is definitely going to be an upcharge, but $30. For two grilled cheese meals. I'm still a huge fan, but it is quite pricey for fast food.

I tried Panera bread but it was packed. After driving around a bit more and running out of time to have lunch, I decided to stop at a small little Cuban cafe. This place, right on Tampa Boulevard was practically right behind my work. I parked and walked in. I was greeted by a friendly woman and I just asked for a Cuban sandwich. She asked me if it was for here or to go. Since I was running behind, I took the sandwich to go. I sat and waited. 

As I looked around, this place seemed festive and being so close to the stadium, it did have sports themed material around. It was quiet in here today and I would have loved to dine in. 

About 5 minutes later, the same woman called me up to the counter. She handed me a warm and decently sized Cuban sandwich. It was only $5.74. Great deal! 

I got back to the office and dug in. This sandwich was large, tasty and filling. From the pork to the ham, melts cheese, mustard and the fresh Cuban bread that was was toasted and crunchy.

"The atmosphere is nice, with cheesy 70s-80s rock music. When I walked in, I was the only person there, and the guy greeted me oddly with ""Can I help you?,"" as if I were in the wrong place. I said, ""I'd like a glass of wine, please."" And he said, ""A girl who knows what she wants."" I found this off-putting since I am a professional person in my 30s. My friend joined me about 10 minutes later, then one other customer was at the bar the entire time we were there.

There are many bottles of wine. The by-the-glass prices are high, with the cheapest being $8 (and only one for that). The prices are probably high to keep the university crowd out and to make a bigger profit, but I wouldn't worry about students with Dunderbak's next door and profit can be better earned by keeping customers. Some inexpensive wine is worth drinking. I know I would've spent more here at $6/glass and would've returned. 

There is no vegan food. My friend ordered the cheese and fruit plate, and the creepy guy tried to dissuade her from it. She ordered it anyway, and literally 35 minutes later, she got it. The guy took her order, then proceeded to talk to the one other man at the bar for half an hour while standing directly in front of us before going to the back to finally prepare it. It was ridiculous, but she was polite about it. It looked delicious, and she shared it with the only other customer, and they ate it all.

Suggestions: Andy is a creep. Replace him with someone friendly, attractive, and good at her job. Add one or two vegan options. It's easy: hummus and pita. Vegan cheese plate. Fruit only plate.

The Cuban is to die for.

The tostones were good, the ham croquettes were amazing!  The papas rellenas were average. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the yucca fries. They didn't taste like yucca, more like just French fries. The orange dipping sauce is so freaking good. It's like the Latin version of YUm Yum sauce.

"This is an update to my original review in which I gave them two stars out of five.

After posting my review, I was contacted by corporate inquiring on specifics about my recent experiences with this particular location. After discussing those details, I was assured that they were going to take them to management and fix it.

Since this location is the closest to my house I decided to give them a try again, and when I went to pick up my online order, they were expecting me (personally). They greeted me by name, told me that they were instructed to fix the previous issues and they gave me a pizza that was SO good that I actually was suspicious that they made it especially good for me to ""shut me up"" lol.

Since that pizza, I have bought from that location at least five or six times more, and every single time they have aced my order. They have proven themselves a great location and I am glad to remove my original two star review and give them a five star review (specifically comparing them to other Pizza huts). 

The wings are still too small though. :)

The atmosphere was basic but comfortable, like any good bar b que place they are most focused on the food. 

The service was good, both ladies that were working were quite nice and our food came out pretty fast (more about that later). We got there on a Friday night about 45 minutes before they closed at 7 pm.

My wife ordered a half rack combo and I initially ordered a pound of pulled chicken but was informed that they were all out. This I can attribute to it being near closing time on a Friday and easily get past, so I went with the smoked sausage. The ribs were very tender and the sauce they had on them was great, not overly sweet like many other bbq places in florida. The sausage was also fantastic, I've never had any quite like it. Our biggest peeve was that the food was cold; not lukewarm but actually cold. Otherwise it tasted great. 

Throughout the restaurant there are signs advertising some very appetizing - sounding bbq sauces and rubs, but there were no sauces on any of the tables, NONE. Most bbq restaurants I've eaten at have at least a couple of different flavored sauces at the table for you to try and use as you please.

For the good, albeit cold, food and quality service I give 3 stars. I will probably return at some point so I can try the food when it is warm and fresh.",1,A,Sho Gud Barbeque Shack,Sho Gud Barbeque Shack,Sho Gud Barb3qu3 Shack,3.0

My daughter enjoyed her burger, but she is not picky when it comes to burgers. Their fries are actually gluten-free which is cool (a lot actually aren't). 

My daughter and I shared a chocolate milkshake. That was actually really good! It was very thick, like a Wendy's frosty. You will need a spoon! They hand mix it and use Ghiradelli chocolate syrup.

but:

...the gelatinous mess of noodles that came with the beef was horrifying. 

There were two kinds of noodles, and some veggies that were mixed in (not enough veggies in that mess to cut the slimy goo) and, a big chunk of fresh ginger that I mistook for a water chestnut - wow was that a shocker. If the ginger had been julienned and spread about it would have helped.

i saw the picture..and it didn't look anything like it..so i had some frozen yogurt instead.. it's a little more expensive then other places.. for that size and stuff.. but it's damn close enough to my school.. so yes.. i will be coming back.. and maybe just maybe i'll be tempted enough to try the soft crepes.. 

oh yes. besides the dessert crepes..they have the lunch crepes too.. and USF students get 10% off .. =)",12,A,Yogomisu,Yogomisu,Yogomisu,3.0

Absolutely horrible service. Front service took our order and money then forgot to make the order. There was only 6 people in the store and we were 3. After asking her what happened she said she lost our ticket. I was so surprised because at that point they still have not made the order. I asked for my money back and she had to call manager. Another 15 min goes by and still no order and no refund. Finally gave me the order after no contact with management. Unbelievable bad service.

"When my friend want to try this restaurant as part of the Latin Crawls. I check yelp that they have only 2 stars rating. I was skeptical to visit this restaurant.  Well, I was visit as out of curiosity and experiences he culture. We have some Ecuadorian restaurant in the Bay Area. This restaurant is above the average. 

One of the best dish will belong to one of my friends' order. He got the black clam rice. This dish I never have it before. It is quite unique in it own way. It is delicious. 

I got the carne asada with red bean soup. The steak is average but it has enough quantities of meat. We also got the corviche de pescado fish in plantain filling. It is good enough experience. We also got the lulo drinks which is great. 

Service is good for our big table. May be we come at the right moment when all the items were in the right place. They deserve 4 stars.",1,A,Mi Bello Ecuador Restaurante,Mi Bello Ecuador Restaurante,mi bello ecuador restaurante,4.0

"I have to say, the only reason this review gets two stars and not one is because the food tasted good. 

The service was atrocious. Sunday night, football is on and I have some people over. I placed a takeout order for a large pizza, and apps and a salad. 

I get there to pick up the food and the girl brings out the pizza box and opens it to show me. Smells great but its actually a teeny tiny pizza. It surprises me because usually the pizza fills up these gigantic boxes. It was my first time here though so I asked the girl, ""hey is this a large?""  She says ""yep thats a large, is it ok?""  

So I'm like ""well if this is your large its fine""...and before I could walk away she whips out a $5 coupon for next time. I thought that was strange but cool whatever. 

So I get home and of course my friends are like is that the pizza we ordered? They don't believe me that its a large and they actually whip out a measuring tape from my toolbox and measure this pizza!

Guess what. It was not the right size, it was the smaller one. So now I am a little upset. 

I called the restaurant and told the manager what happened and he says ""sorry, what do you want me to do?"" 

So I said ""you know all I want is for you to tell the girl who sold me the food what happened because you guys are a pizzeria, there's only pizza and salads on the menu. The employees should be able to tell immediately if the pizza is the correct size, I even left this girl 20% tip on takeout! I appreciate the $5 coupon the girl gave me, but I can't feed my friends with a coupon...""

So he says i'll comp your food no problem. So Im thinking wow thats a nice guy, I used to work in a restaurant so I appreciate that. 

Today my bank card shows an adjustment. He didn't even comp the bill, just a slight discount!

Now I am NOT cheap or a snob by any means. You can look at all of my other yelp reviews and see I like to eat at nice places, and order a lot of food. But it was just not cool to be treated this way.",5,A,Grimaldi's Pizzeria,Grimaldi's Pizzeria,Grim@ldi's Pizzeri@,2.0

Upon first sight it's not well organized and operated in the main hall of a building. Was a lil awkward trying to understand the place. Don't come here expecting to sit down and eat. It's definitely a to-go order spot. Take out only! As for the food itself. Not too bad. The side of the dark meat chicken dinner I got was ok. Just a tiny leg and a regular thigh. Nothing really much to work with there. But the chicken sits on top of your choice of yellow or white rice. The rice was ok with the gravy. Now the collard greens were very good tho! 8/10. The Mac and cheese tho, well let's just say they aren't my favorite. Overall I'd just say this all was average. Nothing stood out to me personally.

"While it's still Hungry Howies, which I prefer over the other pizza chains in the area, this one always disappoints. I'd say 7 out of 10 orders from here something is messed up. I love that this chain carries green olives, which yes I know is weird but i love them on pizza, but a lot of times they get mixed up and put black olives or green peppers. If it's not that, alot of times the delivery people forget our sodas, or bring the wrong one, or they're out of the soda we ordered.

It's still good, and we'll order it out of convenience but I'll make 100% sure to check each order, guess I should've before, but I tend to not care that much. I don't mind black olives, nor green peppers, I just kinda want green olives too. Like if they'd just throw some of them on there too, I'd be cool with that. Like if they realized they put the wrong thing and just put some green olives on top so I'd just be getting an extra topping, I mean that'd be dope.

"What an unexpected delight! After a long day at Busch Gardens, we had an extended family of 10, with ages ranging from 3 to 70+, all hungry at 10 pm and unable to agree on what they wanted. We found Garden Gyros on Yelp! and decided to give it a try. And I'm so glad we did! The Gyros were truly great, and the French fries were truly addictive, some of the best I've ever enjoyed. I heard from other family members that the chicken strips were amazing, and the Greek salad was good. 

If there are any negatives, the fried mushrooms were average. I wouldn't usually complain, but everything else way exceeded expectations, the fried mushrooms were exactly as expected. Also, by comparison with the chicken strips, family members said the buffalo chicken nuggets were just average. 

Also, the parking lot only has like 6 parking spots. So it's kind of a hole-in-the-wall, but they do have a drive-thru.

It's trying to be an upscale restaurant but it doesn't quite make it.   The food is VERY overpriced for the quality.    I ordered the ""Euro chicken, braised short ribs barbeque, red beet mashed potatoes, and creamed corn"".    Was not impressed at all.   Reminded me of a dinner that my mother would serve when I was young.     It was one chicken wing on top of a pile of short ribs smothered! in barbeque sauce with watery creamed corn and mashed potatoes with chunks of beet pieces.     Cost for this entree was $19.00.

Server recommended a dish, so I ordered it. After placing our order, server comes back and says ""Just kidding! They are all out of that today."" - it was 6pm. How can they be out already?

"Our experience started off great but quickly dwindled into one of the worst dining experiences I've had in Tampa.

We were seated immediately, got our free wine with Yelp check-in, and our waitress even gave us some free peach juice to mix in with our Prosecco. A great start!

We had a hard time choosing what we wanted to eat, because so many things sounded really delicious. They partner with So Gourmet for a lot of their brunch items, so we expected a pretty good meal. We ended up deciding on the quiche, smoked salmon platter, and the breakfast sandwich. 

The salmon was mine, and when it came out, all of our jaws dropped. It came out on an entree-sized plate with a small plate portion. It was composed of one piece of pumpernickel bread cut into quarters, a tablespoon of capers and cream cheese, and 1.5oz of salmon. Look at the picture. It was $10. We wanted to laugh, but we were hurting inside. The great thing is that the whole plate was delicious! What would have been even better is if this meal had actually been portioned as a meal. I was so hungry afterward that I ate the other half of my friend's breakfast sandwich that she absolutely hated. It came with very soggy breakfast potatoes. No one at the table liked them. The sandwich was plain, boring, bland. 

My other friend with the quiche was a little happier than the first. That being said, the quiche isn't even made in-house. It's delivered from So Gourmet. So the one thing he liked wasn't even made by Sono. What was prepared by Sono was a pitiful salad made with a handful of greens and some very small crushed nuts that were impossible to get onto a fork.

Our waitress had disappeared for a while, though there was almost no one else in the restaurant and only one party of people at the long table outside. We finally got our checks and left Sono behind forever. None of us will be back.",2,A,Sono Cafe,Sono Cafe,Sono C@fe,2.0

Others must have discovered the poor service, food etc as we were the only table occupied at 6 pm. 

I ordered the Brisket Plate and which came with bread and either 2 sides or a brownie. 

When the owner brought out the dinner it was on a small cookie sheet. I questioned if this was the Plate and he replied that it was the basket but he puts it on the cookie sheet for appearance. He also stated the I received 6 ounces of meat and if I truly had ordered the Plate I would have received 8 ounces of meat. In an effort to appease me the owner brought me a dish of cole slaw. 

When the check was put on the table I was charged for the plate and not the basket. The owner then came to ask if we enjoyed and I told him that I felt there was much confusion. Three times he told me that he gave me the cole slaw in an effort to make up for the poor service and the shortage of beef.

Bottom line: awesome atmosphere, good service, great food. 

We went here for a business lunch. The atmosphere was amazing. Sort of LA meets clean lined white Scandinavian furnishings (see photos). 

The lunch menu was fairly short on options but long on creative flavor ideas. 
I went with the bunless Kona burger (pineapple, red onion, gruyere cheese , added local farm bacon and homemade jalapeños (of course!)
This is one of the better burgers in town. 1/2 pound of great beef, fire grilled. The fries were so-so, a bit too much seasoning salt for my tastes. 

My friends got a steak sandwich and the meatloaf. They both liked their meals as well. 

We finished with cappuccino and espresso, which were average but still tasty. 

The prices are very fair for what you get, but don't expect to walk out for less than $15/ person for lunch unless you don't order a drink. 

There were some gluten free options, but not many. Since this was a lunch menu, it was salads and sandwiches. So either skip the bread or order a salad and be sure to confirm the dressings are g-free. 

The server was very courteous and understanding and made sure to confirm with the chef about gluten free options. 

Go to this place and enjoy!

"My mother and I have frequented the Tea Rose Cottage for several years. They have become a little slice of heaven for us, especially since I moved to Orlando 3 years ago. Whenever I visit my mother we stop by for tea and are always delighted.  They are always very friendly and the food is delicious and fresh. I am surprised and saddened by the negative reviews because I have never experienced anything but the best. I also co-hosted a baby shower for my best friend here probably about 5-ish years ago, and everyone was so enchanted. They do have a set menu, and only take reservations, but such is the norm for those familiar with tea rooms.

Entree: all their tortillas are are handmade, which makes a huge difference. Tacos aren't too big ( 2 big bites or 3 medium), $2/taco. 

* Campechanos - taco with grilled steak, sausage, pork rinds and topped with pico de gallo. It was ok, kind of bland. The pico didn't any punch to the tacos instead made it soggy. 
* Carne Asada - taco with grilled pork, topped with minced cilantro and onion. My favorite, the cilantro made the flavors really pop. 

** They have 2 sauces. Green and pinkish red. He careful with the red one, soo HOT! The green had a minty cilantro taste to it. Very yummy. The sauces would be good together, maybe with fries. I'll try that next time. **

I had a spicy ginger and beef noodle bowl with kale.  I was impressed by the fact that the person making my bowl actually grated the fresh ginger as he was assembling. They also have a nice variety of freshly made teas and lemonades that you can try with the purchase of a fountain drink.

WARNING, NO A/C if you plan on dining in! Also the restaurant has about 2-3 tables and it's really not the cleanest place.  The person that takes orders was not very busy so she sat down at one of the empty tables to watch videos on her iPhone.  Nothing wrong with that, except she kept picking her nose.  Still, at least she was not prepapring the food.

Ordered 2 egg rolls and a large pork fried rice.  No drink.  Total was about $10.

Their food is served very hot and it tastes very good!

"Came in with a group of 8 or so last Saturday. They told us it would be a few minutes for them to put 2 tables together for us - ok fine. In the meantime they start telling people that come in after us that it would be a 30 minute wait to be seated. About 3 potential tables were turned away while we waited there. Strange because the place was EMPTY - I think 3 or 4 tables total, counting us waiting to be seated. Well 30 min later, we are finally seated. We were not told there would be a 30 min wait, just a few minutes. Did it seriously take 30 minutes to push 2 tables together? 

Our server was nice enough, and took our drink orders immediately followed by our food order. We had to be back at the convention center by 230 and it was around 115 or so now so we figured we were good. Well time goes by and goes by and goes by. Some people ordered salads and they were never brought out - asked to have them and we were told sure no problem! We also asked to have our (separate) checks now so that we could pay ahead of time and just leave when we were done. Again, sure no problem! 15 min later when we asked again about the salads and we were told oh we don't do that they will be brought out with the meal. Still no checks. It is now 2pm. We remind him that we need to be somewhere at 230 and ask to have our food in to go containers just in case we don't have time to finish. Sure no problem!

Our food finally came out at 215 along with our checks. I paid $14 cash for my $13 something meal and while everyone else was getting out cards (which took forever to be charged...) I ate my fusion burger as fast as I could. People were missing salad dressing, ketchup, plastic utensils, etc. Finally this was all straightened out and we had asked several times for a discount of some kind because of everything I have written out. We were told that a manager would be coming out but none ever did. Everyone just grabbed their to go boxes and we were about to run out the door knowing we'd be late anyway. Then the host came back out (our waiter had disappeared) and asked if we'd like dessert! You all knew we were in a hurry to get back, we were already out of our seats and walking to the door. No we don't want desert! Even if it was already packed up and ready to go!

That all being said, from what I could tell my fusion burger was good. I did eat the whole thing rather quickly and tried washing it down with my very flat Dr Pepper.

The restaurant did look nice enough outside and in and we thought it would be a great place for lunch as we were all from out of town. There was a great view of the channel. Too bad the whole experience wasn't so great... :\",35,C,Fusion at Flambé,Fusion at Flambé,Fusi0n at Flambé,1.0

"I used to love this place and went there many times. Until one time, when I ordered my favorite sashimi dinner which included stinking (yes, not just smelly!) salmon. I complained and the plate was taken away and came back with the salmon replaced with supposedly good salmon. Now, this salmon was from the exactly same batch, exuding the same pungent smell. I complained again, which brought out the sushi chef, telling me that the fish was perfectly o.k. and ""safe"" to eat (maybe it was, perhaps they put it in chlorox for desinfection). I think this episode tells you two things about this place: The sushi chef has no clue about fish, and they think their customers are dumb and have no idea about japanese food. I would expect that, even if they do not agree with the complaint, that they would take it seriously, and at least honor your request by replacing the questionable item with something else (if they only have one smelly piece of salmon that day...;-).

"I am starting to try new lunch spots around my office, instead of repeating the same places I populate multiple times a week and a few Yelp reviews brought me to Renee's Bistro. It's a small cafe located in one of the office buildings off Boy Scout Blvd.  

I got the salad bar and my boyfriend got a grilled chicken wrap. The grilled chicken wrap took over 10 minutes to make, with zero customers in the cafe. He got the ranch on the side so the wrap was pretty flavorless unless you dipped it in the ranch. I wanted to try the salad bar but was a little disappointed when I got there. The salad bar was just basic (three types of lettuce, veggies, eggs, bacon, ham and different cheeses to choose from) and costs $6.40/lb. I find it hard to drive here to get the salad bar, when you can drive two minutes down the road to have ""the mother of all salad bars"" from Whole Foods for just $5.99/lb.

While I only actually ordered queso, I found that both the queso and salsa were excellent. The guacamole tasted somewhat boring, but it wasn't bad by any stretch of the imagination. 

As my main course, I had two tacos: the Martinique and the Adalia. I cannot recommend either of these. The steak on the Martinique was dry and tasteless so it was really more of a feta and cabbage taco. As for the Adalia, I decided that I did not want the wasabi cream, and my waiter kindly adjusted my order accordingly. But hiding in the taco was something much worse...

Personally, I love seared Ahi Tuna, so I was horrified to find that the Adalia is really just ground pepper. I bit into the taco expecting a light fish taco, but all I could taste was pepper. So much pepper! I opened the taco to find that both slices of tuna had an extremely thick coating of pepper on the sides. This was not the thin coat that one usually finds on seared Ahi tuna. No, the tuna was iced with pepper. I scraped it off, bit by bit. But there was so much! No matter how much I scraped off, there was still more. I tried the taco again, but my scraping was in vain. The pepper destroyed both my taste buds and the taco. Even now, 20 minutes later, I can only taste that unholy pepper in my mouth. If you value your life and your gustatory sense, do not try the Adalia. 

Aside from the surprises with the food, the restaurant had a nice atmosphere. The decor has a somewhat modern/industrial vibe. Even the tacos and chips are served on metal trays. Our waiter left nothing to be desired in his service; I found that my water was filled when I wasn't even looking. 

In short, service good, food middling. If you come there for alcohol,  the tequila menu is enormous. But if you come for food: be careful what you order. 

This Cantina is an offshoot of the island's adjacent Pizzeria. As of writing this, the restaurant is brand new. But restaurants struggle to survive on Davis Islands. Will the Cantina last a year?

"The food at tabla, is a very unique experience. It manages to capture the feel of authentic Indian cuisine, it's how I imagine a Indian grandmother would make her food. Now I don't claim to be a authority on Indian food, but I have to say this is one of the best meals I have ever eaten. I asked the waiter what his favorite meal was he told me that it was the goat masala. So, I told him I would try it. And I must say, I was not disappointed. The meat was tender and melt in your mouth delicious, the naan bread was also exquisite light and fluffy in places and crispy where it needs to be, it was fresh baked in a clay oven. The basmati rice was also delicious. I cannot rate this place high enough for anyone who enjoys Indian food.

"Wanted to try a place we hadn't been to before for my birthday and glad we decided on Grille One Sixteen.  Located in a strip mall on North Dale Mabry in Carrollwood.  The ambiance is dark and modern which makes it perfect for a romantic date night or special occasion.  

Server told us about the 2 for 1 drink special before 8PM and I was intrigued by the Shiso Elderflower Smash which is tanqueray with lime and elderberry type of fusion.  Loved this drink!  The tequila thyme lemonade tasted just like a kamikaze and brought back memories!

Food was excellent, our table of four ordered the pretzel loaf, which comes with two dipping sauces, a cheese and mustard.  Not your usual appetizer and was quite tasty.

For our meals, I ordered the OMG! tempora lobsters.  This came with 3 good size lobsters and usual side is mac n cheese but I swapped that for asparagus.  Fantastic dish and would get again over and over and over!  

Kobe beef came on a bed of rice and huge slice of pineapple.  The tuna tar tar with salad looked quite good too as did the grouper piccata.  

Nice that they came out with four donuts and candle for my birthday.  And yes, even if we had to pay for them, would have had to do it!  As the menu says, over 200,00 served!

"Came here for a Wine and Canvas event and was very impressed. The server came around to check on us several times throughout the evening and he was very good at handling the large Wine and Canvas crowd and keeping up with his other customers. He is very knowledgeable about his selection and other wine events in the area. Toast often gets featured wines and offers new specials on a rotating basis. I ordered a California Pinot Noir (which was on special that night). Just a warning--I love wine, but I don't know all of the terminology. The wine was great, but I can't describe it in the detail that most can. It was very smooth. I only ordered one glass because I was driving, but the server gave me a sample of the other Pinot on their menu for comparison. It was fruity and full of flavor, which I was not expecting from a Pinot! Yet still had all of the mellow smoothness you would expect of a Pinot. Very impressive.

Keep in mind--this is a wine bar, not a restaurant. I say that to temper expectations--this place is great to relax for happy hour with friends. Whether you are a wine connoisseur or just want to try something new, you will like this place. The food is delicious and pairs well with their wines. I orderered a half Cuban and it was plenty for dinner. I wish I had ordered one of the cheese and olive plates because they were much bigger than I was expecting! However, if you are looking for a full meal, this may not be the place for you on that particular night.

"1929 is what the sign at the peak of the exterior of the restaurant says and I think that it indicates the last time it was upgraded or, for that matter, cleaned.  

Someone told me that it ""has the best fried fish sandwich in Tampa!"".  BLECCH.  I wouldn't feed my cat ""food"" from this place.  

I happened to be in the area, went in and waked around the ""dining room"" before ordering.  It is grimy, with stuffing sticking out of the torn booth covers; chunks of formica missing from the counters and booth frames, with the remaining parts held in place with little brad nails; grime on the steam tables; mop bucket with dirty mop water and mop sticking out, stored behind one of the booths; there was not one fluorescent light lens that did not have disgusting brown stains from past roof leaks; tiles missing from sections of the floor; clutter everywhere...I could go on and on. 

Shaking my head and being careful not to go too near the walls for fear that something would jump on me, I left without ordering. 

If the front of the house looks like this I can only imagine (although I wouldn't want to) what the kitchen looks like and how dirty it must be back there....they must pay the Board of Health off. 

This is a place for blue collar working folks to eat at and attracts customers because of the price?!  Might be good if you like Sal Mineo....and the squirts for a week.....

"The best way I can describe our experience was that I felt like I'd been lucky enough to get invited to someone's Momma's house for dinner.  Everybody had one or two of those friends growing up.  Maybe you didn't even like the kid that much - but you stayed friends with them on the off chance they'd invite you over for dinner, because dinner at their house was like visiting the Vatican of Good Food. 

Frank El's is located in a plaza with a number of other restaurants we visit (to the extent we now just refer to it as The Plaza of Awesome Food) and we'd ""window shopped"" a number of times.  When we found out the resturant we were trying to visit was closed on Sundays, Hubby noticed Frank-El's was open.  Talk about wonderful serendipity!

Frank El's has been in the Tampa area for over 14 years - more than 2 years in this location.  The restaurant is no-frills - simple tables, plastic plates and tumblers - but you won't care in the least after your first bite.  The main draw here is the buffet - loaded with quality Southern cooking - though you can order specialties like Oxtail or Roti off the menu.  The night we visited they were featuring 3-4 meat entrees and lots of veggie sides (though none were probably actually vegetarian which is just as it should be with good home-cooking of the Southern variety).

The fried fish was wonderful - lightly breaded and made with a flaky, mild fish.  I made the husband try a piece first and tell me if it was catfish - as I don't do catfish.  Actually, we still have no idea, but if THAT was catfish - it was the best damned catfish I've EVER had.  There was a baked chicken option that looked moist and well-seasoned, but I was intrigued by what looked like mini-meatloaves.  They were in a beefy gravy and studded with tiny bits of onions and green peppers with a hint of sage and reminded me of everything wonderful about the middle of stuffed peppers (never been a fan of the actual pepper part, but the stuffing is always good).  The veggie options included stewed cabbage (most excellent), collard greens (good, but not mind-blowing), and the best red beans I've ever eaten (this is what I had seconds of rather than the mini-meatloaves, seriously).  Rounding out the options were two kinds of rice, corn bread stuffing and some seriously rich mac and cheese.  Oh, and homemade cornbread.  While not specifically for dessert, the candied yams were epic.  Now, none of this marshmallow or nut-topped craziness.  Just delicious chunks of yam in a buttery cinnamon sugar sauce that melted on the tongue.  Based only on the ""OMG, YUM"" faces I was making, the husband got up and served himself a small side bowl, saying that anything I was making ""Crème Brulee Face"" over was something he wanted to eat.  After his first bite, he may have briefly threatened to leave me for the yams (not the person that made them, mind you, the actual yams).

Lovely staff - warm and welcoming and quick to refill our iced tea.  I was really moved to see a number of gentleman, many still in work uniforms, stop by for Take Out.  Frank El's offers both a 1 meat and 2 meat option, both with as many sides as will fit for really good prices.  From the way these guys were greeted and they way they recognized favorites on the buffet, I got the impression these guys were regulars.  It just seems really lovely to have the option after a long day of work to swing by and get some good home cooking.  If my Grandfather lived in Tampa, I think we'd just have his mail forwarded directly here.  Love to see a place that's really plugged into the community and anyone eating this wonderful, cooked-with-so-much-love food couldn't help but have their day be a little brighter.

It came with king crab, clams, shrimp and scallop. Tossed in a cream sauce. I polished all of my food. Husband ordered the snapper and it was delicious as well. 

Did not get any appetizers/extra sides/desserts because nothing stood out.

"I can't believe the owner's response to what appears to be a joking comment by El Jay.
He hates Yelp or hates freedom of expression.  He would be better off business wise, to minimize his own interaction with costumers on here.  When you run a business you don't behave that way,,  esp when it's in writing and she obviously copy, cut, and pasted it.  
I've been to this place twice per week since it opened and bought clothing and stuff and coffee and tea and it's good but there is a hint of weirdness but so does Ybor.  I like it.  However, this place is struggling and is not so busy and needs all the customers it can get so advice to owner is keep your pie hole shut and resist the urge to be a d-bag on here or to any criticism of your business.

Since the chicken parm had been praised in some reviews, I gave it a try, along with a stuffed potato, which we frequently order at Las Palmas, where they are excellent. My wife ordered a Cuban sandwich. We were both less than thrilled. The chicken parm was no better than a frozen dinner, the stuffed potato was dry, and my wife only ate half the Cuban, which she was not impressed with. I can only assume the positive reviews were written by the owners, employees or friends in order to get folks like us to give them a try. It's pretty typical fast food, and we will not go back.

Mata's is located inside of a retail plaza and there is enough parking for you to choose from. It's located on the first floor of the retail plaza. 

Every day their menu changes a little bit and they do offer a special item of the day. Last friday when I went their special item was ""Kare Kare"" (stew). They also offer boba drinks and their famous Filipino dessert called ""Halo-Halo."" On Sundays they offer a brunch menu which comes with garlic rice, eggs, and your choice of a meat or protein they offer. 

I ordered lumpia (eggrolls), fried bangus (milkfish), pancit (noodles), and lechon kawali (fried pork). Everything was delicious! The lechon kawali was crispy and moist, the pancit was delicious, and the fried bangus was soft and had a good flavor to it. The lumpia was good but I was expecting more flavor from it.

The food came to us hot and the service was friendly - but they forgot to give us our sweet & sour sauce and large drink so we went up to the counter to ask about it, and they will were polite about it. Cleanliness or the restaurant was decent, but not overly impressive.

The homemade flour tortillas were to die for! Few minor things that could have been improved on: they served salsa with the chips that was clearly Pace picante out of the jar. The server admitted that it was saying it was due to the lady that makes the fresh salsa wasn't there (on a Saturday late afternoon). I order the skirt steak- it was not skirt steak it was a thin piece of maybe palomilla steak, flavorful but pretty tough. I asked for no beans and sour cream but rcvd the beans and no sour cream. The server was nice enough, but not very attentive to the order or our needs (had to ask for refills several times). The place was completely empty, we were the only ones there.

It was like they opened up a bag of grocery-store taco shells and just piled a bunch of crap into them. The shells weren't even heated up first. One had scallops, while another had shrimp. Neither were even remotely cooked through. There are some great houses on Davis Islands, plus the little ""downtown"" area could be so great.

"I visited this truck twice in one day. Once in the morning for one of their cold pressed juices called Forever Young, which has collagen, orange, lime, strawberry, peach, green tea and water. Really refreshing, great flavor and a steal at $5, especially when factoring in the convenience of it being stationed outside of my workplace that day. 5 stars for that drink!

Then I went back for lunch and ordered a bowl ($8.88). You can choose between grilled chicken, meatball, smoked salmon, quinoa or shrimp (daily special), then you choose your base (brown rice, beans, nutri mix (lettuce, spinach, arugula, celery) add 3 toppings of your choice and a sauce of your choice. I went with the chicken, brown rice, caramelized onions, cheddar cheese, baked potatoes and nutri almond cheese.  It sounds better than it was. The chicken was dry and bland, the rice was too dry, a little undercooked, the almond sauce also didn't add much flavor. I would recommend that they season the chicken more. I did like the potatoes. I would probably add guacamole as a topping next time to give better texture to the bowl. Perhaps even get the beans instead of the brown rice and try a different sauce.  Or maybe just avoid the bowl altogether and try a wrap.  I would give the bowl 3 stars. I tried another drink at lunch, the strawberry lemonade and that was 5 stars.  They do make really good drinks and the service is good. 

I love the concept of a healthy food truck that's available for breakfast or lunch. I will definitely frequent them often even if it's just for a juice or smoothie.

My fiancée and her grandmother were already waiting for me and saved me the last of the bruschetta. It was delicious. 

The service was above par and that atmosphere was very comfortable. The restaurant was busy but not overly crowded. 

I cannot remember the exact dishes of my fiancée an her grandmother (but upon further consultation I was reminded my fiancée got angel hair pasta with Alfredo sauce, noting she has been here on multiple occasions and almost always gets this dish), both involving pasta, big surprise at an Italian place, huh!? But I just was not in the mood for pasta. I decided to go with the Pollo E Formaggio.

It was an absolute delight. I had the choice of a pizza or a calzone. I asked the waitress what she would prefer and she suggested pizza because it roasts the artichokes a lot more. 

When the dishes came out, I was impressed with how it looked. The bread was well done, as is expected with a flat bread, and the cheese was perfectly melted and mixed in with the tomatoes and spinach and chicken and artichokes (and I apologize if I am off on some of the ingredients).

"The worst service I have EVER received. We waited over 40 MINUTES for our food to come out. As my friend and I were waiting in the restaurant, we noticed a lot of older customers go up to the pick up rack to check if it was their order on the ticket on the bag. They were immediately addressed and helped politely. At the 35 minute mark, my friend and I tried to see if a particular order that looked like ours belonged to us. However, a rude hag addressed us in such a condescending manner/ tone and told us that there was a 20 minute wait time (HA, sweetie, it's been WELL OVER 20 MINUTES). We decided to let her attitude slide, politely apologized, and went back to wait.

"Being a Maryland girl, I stalked this food truck for months before finally being able to try it. My first visit, there were highs and lows, but the lowest point was that the crab cake was very undercooked and mushy in the center, and I did not enjoy it.

Fast forward to this past weekend when I thought I'd give them another try. I had the Classic Crab Cake Platter to-go. It came with a crab cake, set on a tomato and piece of lettuce, and french fries with Old Bay sprinkled on them.  I asked for them to cook my crab cake longer this time, and I enjoyed it much more than my first visit. I thought there was a decent crab to filler ratio.

In the future, though, they should probably avoid putting the hot crab cake on the cold lettuce and tomato, since that made them warm and mushy.  Also - both the picture on their menu board, and their menu online says the platter comes with coleslaw, which it did not. The platter costs $21, which I think is high for what you actually get.

The couple that owns this food truck are SO NICE, and I think they are trying really hard to make great Maryland food for the masses, so I'm sure I will be back.",40,C,Charm City Eats,Charm City Eats,Ch@rm City E@ts,3.0
"Very disappointed in the care and quality of work. The owner came and showed that he couldn't be bothered to inspect the quality of his work. Failing to show up for three scheduled appointments and finally showing up 40 minutes late to do the walk through... Which after several emails and photos of the quality of work he sent someone else to do the walk through with me only after his employee called him and told him that he should come over did he bother to come. They came in and did a mediocre job at best on the outside of our home. When the job was done they left trash everywhere, left hose running, left their ladder's thrown on the side of my house. Left their trailer parked outside my house like it was a storage unit for almost a full week. Honestly I can keep going and going... Most of these problems are petty but when you add them all up it just translates to I have no supervision from the owner and a I don't care attitude. He is clearly letting his employees do what they want. When we spoke today he treated me with a complete lack of concern as he said "" sorry about all this but did your wife leave a check for me"" and ""is everything OK now?""I would not be fair if I didn't add the fact that I felt they did such a good job on the inside of my house that I didn't even look at another company for the exterior...

"I never thought I would describe a grocery store as beautiful and lively but that's how I want to describe this Publix! I stepped in to get a couple of things (I'm visiting the area, so no extensive grocery shopping for me), and I left a happy camper!

Parking is easy to find. As soon as I walked in, everything was just flowing smoothly and the staff actually looked happy and nice. I walked around (looking for the pre-made deli sandwiches), but to not waste anymore time, I stopped an employee working the floor and asked for her help! She didn't just stop and tell me, she asked me how I was and actually walked me to the section. 

I had to walk across the store to the bottled fruit juices, and with that, I was able to get a glance down every aisle. Everything was clean and well-stocked. There were also several employees on the floor cleaning up and restocking/reorganizing. 

When I went to check-out, I was most surprised! Most of the cashiers were college-age, so I (guiltily) assumed the worst - maybe not the worst but definitely not the best. I was so pleasantly surprised! There was a woman ahead of me in line, and the cashier's interaction with her was great! The woman asked the cashier if she knew where this item would be (not knowing the brand/etc.) and the cashier not only heeded her question but she was so willing to go look for it, if the customer wanted. I rarely hear cashiers OFFER to go out of their way, so it was really nice. She was also kind to me and asked me if I found everything okay/how my day was/etc., and while that is to be expected from a customer service associate, it's not commonplace these days, so it definitely made me a happy customer.

"We are thrilled with Catered Fit on many levels, it has been perfect for us. It is changing the way we eat.  We're 2 adults and a teenager, and we're doing the 4 Combo meal plan, and scheduling them for delivery 3-4 days a week. We were hoping to be able to eat out a little less, cook at home a little less, and eat healthier. We've been using it for about a month now. Here's what we've found:

-The meals taste really delicious, I would say about 85% of them we are even WOWed by the flavor, we've been really surprised. The meats/veggies are not overcooked. Fresh herbs, nice sauces.
-Cooked same day they are delivered. For us they usually come around 6p and we can eat them that night. I love that they are already cooked, and they don't really taste like leftovers.
-Massive variety - we're now eating all sorts of different vegetables that we wouldn't normally cook at home, and the meals have such different flavors, Indian, Vietnamese, Southern ""fried"" chicken, Italian. 
-Big selection: 6 choices per day as you can choose from the lunches seems to be interchangeable with the dinners. John is a picky eater, and can always find something he wants without mushroom or beans or sweet potatoes or any of the things he doesn't like.
-Eating healthier because I'm getting my veggies every day, I'm trying some lower carb ideas from the Paleo menu like zucchini noodles or miracle noodles, but you can still get real pasta on the Classic Menu. The meals are balanced and portion controlled, nothing fried, no white flour or sugar, no antibiotics/hormones in the meat. Fun to have options ground turkey and chicken dishes that would normally be made with beef like Thai Curry Chicken Meatballs, or Indian Shepherd's Pie. occasionally beef too like Lasagna (and a low carb version too!)
-Feels like Christmas when the meals arrive, we can't wait to try them. 
-Feels like we're eating out too, because we each get to choose what we want, and the meals are complex and interesting like restaurant food, and someone else made it!
-The service has been reliable, and customer service on the phone was helpful and friendly, they helped me customize some meals Women and some meals Men portions.

Please understand this isn't American! It's very unique and they experiment with different flavors with really delicious ingredients. The condiments are made in house and seriously get the chipotle mayo. Don't be scared, and try the Lithuanian bread sticks. Be warned it's Lithuanian bread (similar to pumpernickel) with light salt and doused in butter served with the cheesiest in house blue cheese dressing. changed my life! The salmon burger is insanely delicious with always decadent and generous portions of salmon on this insane potato bread bun. Honestly, words don't do it justice.

"Yesterday I had the unfortunate experience of going to the Tea Rose cottage in Ybor with my daughter, my two friends and their daughters. I rarely post negative reviews, but this time I am compelled.  I had a very poor experience. I would not recommend it for you or any of my friends. The owners, waitress, and chef (same people) were not only rude from the start (unhappy when we tried to increase our reservation by one...who is displeased by MORE business?!) One 3 year old child in our party unexpectedly fell sick,  was visibly crying and had to leave (before being served, touching any dishes nor napkins ). The owner was visibly unhappy that 4 customers who were on the reservation had to leave. Notably, there were 3 vacant tables around us so clearly, no customers were turned away due to out reservation. The owner had the audacity to charge us for two adults and two children who were never served nor consumed any food nor beverage(full price)! To add insult, gratuity was pre-added in for 4 absent customers. We were informed that is their policy and that all the food was prepared specifically for us ahead of time. When we questioned them and said we have never heard of such a policy at any restaurant, nor were we ever informed of this policy when we made the reservation, they shrugged their shoulders and said - well, what do you expect us to do? Important to note, this is a teahouse where there is a fixed menu and nothing is specifically ordered nor specifically chosen from the menu. In fact, one main item served was PB&J (not a large monetary investment for a restaurant!). When we asked to try a different kind of tea, they expected us to finish the tea that was in our cup, wait until they washed out our teacup before serving us the new tea. (I am pretty sure, this is not a British tradition.)  Even though there were empty teacups available at the next place setting, they did not want us to use more than one tea cup per person! It was incredulous, inconsiderate, and has/will lead to loss of current and future customers. The policy is even more hypocritical since they do not take a credit card number when making a reservation. Hence, we may have not showed up at all and not have been responsible for any payment!
After I vehemently complained, they unhappily reduced the charges from 80+ dollars to 50+ dollars. They removed the gratuity and subtracted the charges for one adult. As I left, they apologized that I had a poor experience. This weak apology in no way makes up for the fact that we were never informed about their completely unfair and inappropriate policy, and that they incredulously expected us to be responsible for payment of four absent customers!",39,C,Tea Rose Cottage,Tea Rose Cottage,Tea Rose Cottage Inc.,1.0

"***This review is only for the bar service during Happy Hour***

While staying at the Doubletree Hotel, I decided to check out here 5 for $5 Happy Hour, which is offered daily (Monday to Sunday) from 4 pm to 7 pm.  First let me say that this  Happy Hour promo title is misleading -- you don't get 5 items for $5.  The happy hour menu consists of 20 items that are each $5: you can choose from 5 wines, 5 beers, 5 cocktails and 5 food bites.

I decided to go in here only because I saw the Happy Hour sign while I was waiting for a local restaurant to deliver food that I'd just ordered -- never crossed my mind to eat here. There wasn't really anyone in there; Maybe not a good sign for a Friday night and there are at least 2 wedding parties at the hotel for the weekend. At any way, I was greeted by Jimmy, who explained the Happy Hour menu and got me started on an Amaretto Sour (which eventually multiplied).  Not bad, plus Jimmy was pretty cool and provided good service. Eventually a few other patrons came in and I made some small talk with a couple visiting from England.

Overall, it was a good time so I ventured back in there the next day for happy hour again.  Again, it was a very thin crowd.  Jimmy was there again so I ordered a couple of  ""my usual"", watched a little bit of the games.  

The restaurant itself is of decent size with a window view (of the pool), respectable decor and a reasonable ambiance. There are 2 tvs mounted in the bar area. In general, it is an okay place - I'd come back for happy hour (especially since you don't have to pay for parking at this hotel).

"Cool vibe, nice staff. Altough, next time I would opt for a more cozy seating option or the bar. We stopped in for a light dinner and ordered the following: 

Fire-Roasted Artichoke Hearts:
Very good! Want to make this at home, it was served luke-warm not sure if that was intentional but I would have preferred it hot. 

Baked Burrata:
Depending on the season it can be baked within zucchini or squash. It was wrapped in zucchini and it was superb! Baked burrata can never go wrong but with the fresh ingredients, including caper-pignoli-parsley pesto, this dish is a must-have! 

Belgian Waffle & Mushrooms:
Ok, I struggle with this one. It was good but my palette just didn't agree. There is a place for mushrooms and a place for Belgian waffles. However, with that being said, my friend thoroughly enjoyed it. So it depends on preference. The mushrooms were the best part of this dish. 

Lemon-almond cake:
All the things that make the world a better place. Ugh! You just cannot get almond cake better than this unless you travel out of the country. 

***I cannot remember the name of the drink for the life of me but it is a tiki inspired cocktail that was not too sweet with just enough kick. I do remember it had pineapple as an ingredient. Hope to see more cocktail features like this one!

"3.5 stars! Never would have thought this was an Italian restaurant from the outside! I loved the warehouse building being turned into a restaurant and how the interior is built with an old fashioned appeal. The brick walls definitely fits in with Ybor City!

Service was great! I forget the name of our waiter but he was extremely attentive and polite. He constantly checked up on us, bringing us refills on drinks and fresh baked sourdough bread with garlic butter. The bread and garlic butter were oh so good! I could have eaten the bread and butter all by myself!

They really do accommodate large groups for a reasonable price. For a party of 4 adults and 2 kids, we ordered the Sicilian Sampler. It was the perfect sampler for the group! We got to experience a little bit of everything. You get to choose four options from the following: Toasted Ravioli, Mozzarella Fritta, Fried Zucchini, Calamari, Stuffed Mushrooms, or Bruschetta. The calamari was really good! The bruschetta was OK, nothing special. 

For the main entrée, we ordered two Italian Feast. We should have just stuck to one instead because it was A LOT of food leftover. The platter came with Chicken Parmigiana, Lasagna, Spaghetti with Tomato Sauce, Ravioli with Alfredo Sauce, Sweet Italian pork sausages, handmade meatballs and garlic bread! Oh and not to mention that the entrees are served with your choice of a Garden Salad or Soup (similar to the Olive Garden).

The food itself was awesome. Everyone ordered a few things that were passed around the table, so I have no idea what exactly I ate, but everything was delicious! I'd happily come back for the sushi & appetizers, although probably during regular business hours because- again- I'm old.

The service I'd say was Meh. Not great, not terrible, but you would expect them to be a little bit more attentive to a large(ish) party. However, it was late and the place was pretty busy, so it's understandable.

Ordered Crab Rangoon, didn't even come out warm, informed them- they just refried it again and served the same ones, which ended up being hard as rocks...the server wouldn't even hand me the box, instead sat it on the counter and walked away. Incredibly rude. I'm pretty sure she dipped them in the toilet or did something unsanitary to them. Couldn't let the manager know because they said he was on break and sleeping at that time.

I also ended up ordering the fries with Cajun on it. The server came by with the food shortly and the burger, while it looked relatively smaller, was quite filling. The burger tasted very good and the Cajun fries were even more delicious.

"La lucha between ""big"" and ""small"" is real in the Colombian Corridor with La Pequeña Colombiana (The little Colombian) and La Gran Colombia (Large Colombia), and I'm not sure there is a winner between them.  I find both to be okay with some aspects being good, while others need refining.  But this review is for the new La Gran Colombia, formerly known as Los Jarrones.

Let's kick off with the good.  Like any good Colombian joint, there is plenty of Postobón and Colombiana soft drinks to go around.  Their BANDEJA PAISA is a real BANDEJA PAISA, which means you get steak, rice, beans, fried egg, chorizo, a chicharrón and arepa for one reasonable price.  $14 to be exact.  Some places like to call their bandeja paisa something else and charge more money for it--not cool.  This is my ""go-to"" dish at Colombian eateries and I use it to gauge how good their food is, and La Gran didn't disappoint.  However, I have found that every restaurant's bandeja paisa seems to have one ingredient that falls short in some way.  At this place, it's the chorizo.  Otherwise, the rest of the meal was on point.  Like ahi? Theirs is fantastic.  Definitely made in-house.  I should have gotten some to go.  There is a review from Andrea on 4/12 stating that it took an hour for her food to come out.  All of our dishes came out very fast, so no complaints on their speediness from our party.  Lastly, there is a full bar, so you can have whatever you want to sip on.  Very nice touch!

Now for the bad.  The service was terrible.  We were the last to arrive in a party of 8, and we sat there for a long while before a drink order was even taken.  We were never given menus either.  Seeing that we had no menus, one of our party members handed us theirs.  Thanks Steve!  Also, there was no follow up once the meals were delivered.  No one asked how the food was or if we needed anything, blah blah blah.  The two waitresses looked dazed and confused, sort of darting around aimlessly as if the place was packed.  There was our party, and a couple in the corner that actually got way more attention than we did.  Then, and this is something that really chaps my ass, we were held hostage.  It was painfully obvious that the whole table was done eating, and they even cleared away our plates, but no one ever came by to give us a bill.  The waitress, Natalia, just stood in a corner fanning herself with a menu (because it was hot as hell), looking at us. We had to get up and go ask for the check after a while.

My rating is a 2.5, but since that isn't an option, I'm rounding up to a 3.  I think La Gran has serious potential.  The venue is great, and their food is certainly better than La Pequeña, but they need to work on their service.  Also, Colombian Corridor or not, your staff has to speak some Engrish!  When I'm ordering and talking to my server, I don't wanna get the deer-in-the-headlights look.  Pick up a phone, call any large company, press ""1"" and learn some freaking basics.

The coconut macaroons were awesome but the life changer were the CRONUTS! Crossiant in the inside and donut on the outside.... OMG it was amazing!!!! Only thing I'm upset about is she didn't tell us to get a whole box of it lol. It will literally leave you felling Euphoric! They even gave us a $5 discount just for it being our first time there.

"Boy, this place is as tiny of a free-standing store as you're going to find these days. (No wonder they have a refrigerated trailer in back to keep all the supplies!)

And their lunch was well-worth being in those close quarters to get it. 

While I knew what I wanted before even setting foot in the place thanks to the review of Isabelle R., I looked at the menu anyway and almost talked myself into buying multiple items just to try a few different things because I liked the combinations.

In the end, I went only with the chicken salad sandwich that I came for and thought it was very, very good. Good texture, plenty of it and served on very fresh pumpernickel round sliced bread. (As Rupert G at the Hello Deli said on one of the last Letterman shows, ""Pumpernickel? We just met."")

Also, when you add a side dish from Barrow's like macaroni salad, pasta salad, dill potato, etc...you get a really large amount of it for only $1.75. They aren't skimping on those at all.

Oh, and while I barely got in the door just past 1pm because the line was about five deep, my wait to order and receive it was surprisingly short and the employees kept things moving along nicely.

There are roughly 10 tables, some of which are pushed together, and a tiny lunch counter so the place fits my take-out routine perfectly.

"Run for the hills. 

I went here with my boyfriend who was born & raised in Tampa and the last time he made an appearance at China Pearl was when he was 13 years old. 
 
He told me this great story about their food and how they used to have unlimited crab legs and how ""delicious"" it was. 

So we went and I wanted to walk out the moment I set foot inside, but my boyfriend is an odd one that once he walks in regardless of the situation we are going to eat there. 

This establishment is a horror show and no longer is the China Pearl he once knew. 

The food is lukewarm, the sushi is alarming and should not be touched with a ten foot pole, the ambience is depressing as you stare at the surrounding delusional people eating the bland, weirdly flavored food, and going up for second helpings.

On top of all that there is a sign on the buffet that says ""If you need your food heated up ask your server""

That right there should have been a dead giveaway, but I still proceeded to try the food that whispered ""We've been out here since this morning, we're still good, I promise. Just try us.""

Nothing, Nothing, NOTHING, except for the water, Mountain Dew mix, and the waitresses being on top of their refill game was good.

"One word: Horrible. We went here for my 21st birthday thinking it was a casually nice environment. Wrong. The host was miserable at best-sat us down and left before we even got to the booth. The waitress was quite pleasant..at first. We had appetizers and an entree; the food was okay-but not good enough to make up for the horrible wait staff. The waitress did not clear the appetizer plates or dinner. I ordered penne vodka with chicken-the pasta came out with no chicken, and the waitress said it would be about 4 minutes; 15 minutes later my chicken came out-I mixed it in and dug in! It was horrible. The waitress came and asked if we needed boxes (my mother ordered the same dish that was also left barely touched), and when we said no she didn't ask what was wrong or if she could get us anything else. No apology was given when the chicken was late either. My mother went to speak with a manager because the waitress continued to practically ignore us and our plates from appetizers and dinner still await her pick up. The manager acted like it was his first day; nervous and incompetent. Once my mother had spoken to him we had to wait several more minutes to get the new check with the removed items. He came back to the table to mention that my  mother should call Dennis, ""the big boss,"" and then he nervously left. No apology, nothing.

The main attraction is of course the Mangobiche where they shave the mango in front of you and top it with whatever you like! I believe the traditional way is topped with lime and salt, but you can add chili spices, or sprinkles, whipped cream, or whatever! You can get all spiraled mango, or have mango smoothie on the bottom (my fave!!), or you can have a fruit juice on the bottom with the spiraled mango on top.

"I really loved Shah's when it opened, but the quality has completely gone down the drain. It feels like the owner started the business then left his employees to take over with no oversight or help. Absolute chaos. Portion sizes are tiny (we got half a portion of rice and maybe 5 pieces of meat), they barely put any sauce on (none on the rice), salad was soggy, and the meat feels reheated. Food was barely warm. And they got our order wrong. 

The staff was very rude, hard to get ahold of, and two of the employees weren't wearing masks or gloves. No one was wearing hairnets. Everyone's hands were dirty from trying to fix the truck itself. I saw someone comment on them messing with the generator then getting back to making food - this is exactly what I saw too. If your generator isn't working, maybe it's a good idea to close for the day. Also, they had a weird system where they can't take credit cards but want you to send money on Zelle or Cashapp and show them your phone screen when done. I thought this was bizarre. 

They also got our order very wrong. We ordered 4 platters and a gyro. We got 2 platters and 2 gyros. When I asked them for what was missing, I got a very rude ""I gave that to you already"" in reply. When I showed her every single container, she finally accepted the mistake. Extra sauce is an extra charge, and they're out of hot sauce and falafel. You get a drink with every order - the choices are Mountain Dew and ginger ale. Huh?

I saw multiple people ahead of me tell them they ordered ahead and be met with looks of confusion. I'm not sure why Shah's is on Uber Eats or any other platform if they don't allow delivery/pick up. 

I brought family from out of town and talked up Shah's so much. It was SO disappointing. I will not be back unless something changes.",38,C,Shah’s Halal,Shah’s Halal,Shah’s Halal,1.0
"The place is fancy! Looks fancier on the inside than out. We were just walking around international mall and wanted to try a new place for dinner. I searched on google and saw that ocean prime was a really close one we hadn't been to before. We had to drive to it even though it's less than a mile from international mall, there's kind of no way to walk to it. There's outdoor self parking spaces and valet parking available. 

We didn't have a reservation but were seated immediately, we didn't mind whatever seating option became first available. They do have a main ""dining"" area with live music, a covered patio area and an area close to the patio area (which is where we sat). The temperature inside was VERY cold. Other than that it was nice. 

The staff is so friendly and service is amazing. Big thanks to our server Cristy, she was SO sweet, attentive, and knowledgeable. 

The food! I was surprised at how good everything tasted! Every single thing I tried was amazing. 

I tried the lobster bisque, it was so good. Love how they brought it out with just the lobster meat at first then poured the bisque on it. It was so smooth and creamy. Hearts of romaine salad was yummy too, but it was my least favorite out of all. 

Goat cheese ravioli was really unique, I'd definitely get it again. I like goat cheese in general but never had it in ravioli form. Also, I don't know what sauce it came with but it was really good. 

Calamari was nice and crispy. Filet minion was made perfectly, had a Smokey flavor, I didn't really like the presentation though. Black truffle Mac and cheese was heavenly cheesy goodness. 

The butter cake... no matter how I describe it, the description will never match the real thing. The warm softness of the most moist cake along with the cold creamy ice cream. Cake compliments of the chef since it was my moms birthday. 

All in all my favorites, in order:
Butter cake

Overpriced. Tasteless. I ordered the Korean cheesesteak. It was apparent they melted American cheese over a tough and grizzled piece of steak. I couldn't taste the gochuchang and there was no candied anything sprinkled on it. The mac and cheese was also overcooked and also tasteless. It also took thirty minutes to get our food from the time we ordered it and the line was not long at all. No apology. No explanation. I don't mind waiting for quality. Didn't find it here.

"If you've never been to a Chinese bakery, you'll love the experience from seeing and smelling all the yummy buns, cookies, and tarts!

When you first walk in, you'll want to grab a tray and your own tongs. They did have gloves during covid. You browse through the cases and choose what you like. When you're ready, you just bring your tray to the register and they'll box it for you. There are more choices in the display case next to the register which has all the refrigerated cakes, cheesecakes, mousses, etc. They also have additional items (noodle soups, coffee, congee, etc.) on the menu board, but I think that's limited during covid. 

As far as buns, you won't go wrong with anything. You MUST try the pineapple bun - the only place that has real pineapples in the bun. Egg tarts are yummy and flaky, but as usual, heavy in butter/fat. There's some more unique stuff like taro buns or lotus almond buns. Go for it and try it! The ingredients are usually just some form of sweetener like bean paste or vegetable. 

If you like things that aren't too sweet, then you'll have to try their birthday cakes. These are typical Chinese fruit cakes - a light vanilla sponge cake with layers of fruit and cream (like cool whip) in between. Chinese people LOVE these (all my family at least lolol). Try the regular, then try taro or mango. They start at $35 for larger sizes, but you might be able to purchase a small slice from the case.

The cake slice is rather MASSIVE, dense in feeling and very big on flavor, screaming decadence. Its an airy chocolate layer cake with bourbon buttercream iced between the layers (and i can definitely taste the bourbon!) with a thin layer of chocolate in between as if the cake itself already wasn't indulgent enough! Next i had the chocolate praline: it was a chocolate shell filled with an an airy chocolate mousse inside and crunchy praline nibs in the bottom. Delicious. They offer a huge assortment of baked goods and coffee products in addition, which i am stoked and eager to try in the not so distant future. Each dessert was fairly pricey (the cake was $15, praline $12 respectively) but considering the massive size of each piece and the high end ingredients, its well worth it!

No flavor, no garlic and just oil.  Off to the cheese fries which were in edible.  They tasted like old grease, twice cooked or something funky going on.

After what seems like years of La Tropicana sitting vacant, they have (at some point) re-opened under new management.  Curious as to what has or hasn't changed, we decided to swing in and grab a light lunch.  What I found was that nothing has really changed, not even the furniture.

I got a half Cuban, which was edible, but won't be winning any awards at the next Cuban Sandwich Throwdown.  There was half a slice of salami, very little pork and by default it included lettuce and tomato.  I did see some reviews where folks belly-ached about it not being pressed, but I'm on the fence about that since pressing them is a recent development in the history of the sandwich.  So one could argue that they're going for actual authenticity, but then if that was the case, it wouldn't have had lettuce and tomato.  Either way, it is not a difficult sandwich to make, so how so many people get it wrong is beyond me, especially in Ybor.  

I got a side of black beans on the side, and it was right on.  So like I said, everything was edible, but nothing to rave about.

Hubby had some sort of pastrami with special sauce that he enjoyed as well. Kids chowed on PBJ and asked if they could come here everyday (and we hadn't even eaten donuts yet!)

We got a dozen mixed donuts to go- including the bacon, s'mores, cereal topped (golden Graham's, capt'n crunch) Oreo, butterfingers, Heath bar, sprinkled and my favorite- the red velvet) they were fun and tasty.",6,A,So Nuts! Donuts & Deli,So Nuts! Donuts & Deli,So Nuts! Donuts & Deli,4.0
"Who doesn't love some freshly prepared Mediterranean food?!?  

On Friday November 8th - Sunday November 10th is the annual St. John Greek Orthodox Church,  Tampa Greek Festival. 

It is well organized and a wonderful experience for the entire family. The food is all freshly prepared, generously sized and reasonably priced!   Most of the food is set up in the air conditioned gymnasium and there are plenty of tables to sit at in the air conditioning.  Also, there are gyros being cooked and prepared outside and there are plenty of tables outside under a big tent.  Don't forget dessert!  It's absolutely delicious and you will not be disappointed at the amount choose from.  There is also a bar with cocktails and beer.  There was a live band playing in the gymnasium when I was there.   

This fair also offers Take-Out by the Pan, which is a wonderful idea if you want some Mediterranean Food for later! 

The parking is difficult in this  crowded area.  The church provides several lots for parking. I parked in a small lot which was a block away and required a little walk. 

Its a $2 per person donation to enter but was free to enter before 4pm on Friday.  (I'm not sure if that applies every day)",39,C,Tampa Greek Festival,Tampa Greek Festival,Tampa Greek Festival,4.0

Not wanting a traditional pasta dish, I decide on Chicken Marsala. I was not disappointed. My meal was accompanied by 2 side dishes consisting of potatoes and steamed broccoli. Chicken was in a flavorful Marsala sauce which the two side dishes were also introduced. I wanted to lick the plate, but fought back the urge. I hereby grant you permission to lick your plate. You can thank me later. ;-D

"LOVE LOVE LOVE this coffee shop! I am hooked on them, no seriously. I live 30 minutes away and make the drive happily, just to have another cup of their delicious coffee. Also a plus, their food is amazing. Customer service is great as well, everyone is super mellow here.

First time I went I really underestimated the place, the outside isn't to appealing and the drive-thru through me off(very convenient). I thought will this be like another Starbucks ? I was so wrong. Went inside and the place is super cute & cozy(couch is so comfy). Interior is very simple & organized. I think it has a good amount of seating and I never have trouble with parking when I come.

I've gone 3 times in a row since I first went. Always order my iced latte with caramel& vanilla flavor. Their coffee is strong, that's my favorite part and very unique tasting. It is lightly sweetened and taste just right. I'm not sure of their method when making their coffee but it always has a nice fluffy creamy foam on top,whether you order a hot or iced latte. It's so good and just thinking about it makes me want one. Friends & family members think the same.

Food is delicious. VEGAN options as well, so kudos to them. I've had the avocado salmon toast & the lemon aioli biscuit, and both are scrumptious. Their pastry items are as well. Very good prices compared to other coffee shops on Tampa.

They have a reward program which is always a plus. Every 5 drinks , you earn a FREE one. This is very fair and will keep me coming back . Lastly, if you attach their company sticker on your car bumper you receive 20% off your order, when you go through their drive thru. Only place I know that does this and doesn't hurt that the sticker is super cute &represents me (also free).",24,B,Caffeine Roasters,Caffeine Roasters,C@ffeine Ro@sters,5.0

"Awesome Greek food, Awesome service!

I had been wanting to try Santorini's since they opened up, as I live really close by. Today, a couple of us went there for lunch. I had called prior to going to discuss my low-carb diet and if they would work with me on it. They said yes, come on in.  :)

We arrived, and went in. Ordered at the counter... I got a Gyro platter, no fries, no Pita wdges... and they gave me extra salad to make up the difference. The platter also included a nice little portion of Hummus.

Coworkers ordered a Chicken pita, a side of Falafel, and Potato Salad. They gave us a complimentary order of hummus and chips too.. and it was really, really good! 

My Gyro platter had a lot of nicely done Gyro meat... that was actually fried up with chopped garlic, a nice extra touch (and yummy fried garlic... I love it!) So much salad, that I could not finish it. And more Hummus... yes, I managed to finish that! lol!

Teammates said their food was really good too, and they either ate it... or got take out containers for the leftovers. The portions here are not small! But they are yummy!

"My husband and I love going to Brew Bus for drinks, and we are even more delighted that they now have a restaurant inside!

This review is long overdue- as I'm now going to comment on how they did a great job with renovations from what it was as Florida Ave Ales...bright and airy- plenty of seating- clean!

My husband says their Last Stop IPA is the cleanest, crisp IPA he's ever had (which says a lot). He really enjoys when they have the Peach version and coffee infused version as well.  

I tend to enjoy the ciders from Cigar City that are always on guest tap there. 

Love the monthly brunch they host as well. Only been once but food was delicious- I can imagine now with their in-house kitchen it will only be better.

Some other notable things: it is very dog friendly, also kid friendly, they have some cute merchandise, you can get growlers of their main beers filled any day, but of their derivative beers only on Wednesdays (they change out the tap on Thursday), Monday nights local residents get a free beer, and it seems as though you can rent the space out for private parties.

"This place is nice but pricey. I've noticed that there was a security guy who stands by the elevator leading to the hotel rooms. He asked for our room card and swiped to make sure we belong there. That was quite nice. Rooms are excellent and clean but fully expected at this price. It is large casino with plenty of restaurants. There is also a spa which me and my partner did go to. I've been to other nice hotel spas and this wasn't as good. The spa facility itself is nice but maybe it's the massage therapist which I got. I'm familiar with the process as I have a family member who does this as a profession and also been to several spas. She did not do the draping correctly and I didn't feel much effort from her overall. There were also other clients right outside of my treatment room. They sounded as though they just finished getting a treatment and was talking pretty loudly. I don't blame them really but the facility should be designed better I think. I did about $300 gambling with the slots. Didn't do the table games. It wasn't really my thing. Overall, the hotel & casino is good but pricey. I live in Orlando and I just kinda wanted to try there.

"Okay where to start...we walked in and the person working looked almost pissed off that we walked in.  No big deal, I get it, work is a drag and I like to give people the benefit of the doubt.  The menu looked fairly tasty so it didn't bother me.  I ordered the gyros pita, a veggie pita, and a cheese pizza.  Fairly simple right? So I get the food, the gyros wasn't bad, but wasn't great either.  Fairly filling but the meat was lukewarm at best.  My wife's veggie pita was good.  Nothing to complain about there.  My son's cheese ""pizza"" was nothing but a pita and cheese sprinkled on it and melted.  No tomato or pizza sauce.  This is where I start to get irked.  I will say, at least the cheese on there was very generous but I wasn't looking for cheesey bread.  

Now, in the middle of eating, the fire alarm went off and continued to go off for 15 minutes.  Not to the owner or workers fault but a simple "" hey sorry about the noise but there's nothing I can do about the alarm"" would have been nice to hear.  He looked miserable sitting behind the counter on his tablet watching YouTube so I just let it be.  Next, I go to refill my drink and decide to get some iced tea.

As we were walking in there was an older man at the counter complaining over something but I totally ignored it and went to the register to place our order.  Ordered 2 hook and ladder combos with a side of Mac and cheese for my daughter.  After we placed our order, we found a table and sat down.  After sitting there for a bit I knew it felt like an awful long time so I looked at my phone compared to the time stamp on the receipt and 18 minutes had already passed! Say what!?  I also happened to notice that there were about 4 people standing around also waiting for their to go orders, as well as a lot of the tables being full.  Sitting there a bit longer, I'm seeing the people behind the cook area sort of arguing and seem confused about orders or something, then the guy comes out and delivers food at the table next to ours which those people were after us in line! I can't believe what I am seeing -- and we are starving at this point along with our frustration as now its been over 20 minutes and no food!  My husband went up to the register to ask how much longer for our food and the clerks all looked puzzled, then tell him that they haven't even started our order yet!!  Are you freaking kidding me.  WOW.  He is beyond frustrated at this point and asks for a refund -- we will go somewhere else to have lunch.  He has to wait for another individual to come over to process the refund then we end up leaving.  I don't know what is happening to this location but although this has been the worse experience here, it's definitely not the only complaint or lack of quality service we've experienced here.

When I entered La Casona, I was impressed by the beautiful ambiance. The waitresses were very friendly, which always has a lasting impression in my book. Unaware of their popular dishes, I was informed that the most popular is the Mofungo, which is a fried plantain-based dish that includes Cajun broth and pork. I order the Mofongo relleno de Camaronés, which included sauteed shrimp, vegetables, and stir-fried mussels.  It was, by far, one of the best dishes I've tasted.

"To preface this review, I feel compelled to include that *I absolutely loathe writing bad reviews & I feel awful doing this.*

Yesterday evening, my family and I excitedly visited the new Midtown Tampa Shake Shack, but sadly, we left deeply disappointed. I had been hyping up the franchise to my family for some time, seeing as I've been a lover of Shake Shack since ~2016 when I had my first magical experience at a Las Vegas Shake Shack franchise. Since then, I've been to various SS franchises around the country--Chicago, San Francisco, etc. Every time, it's been a delicious, memorable event. Top-notch burgers, shakes, fries, chicken, sauces, etc. The Midtown Tampa Shake Shack is severely lacking in more ways than one. 

Cons:
1) Parking is atrocious 
2) We waited ~30 minutes for our food to be ready to take to go--there was only 1 single order ahead of our own
3) The shake machine was down/broken 
4) Staff were seemingly careless, preoccupied, moody
5) The fries & hot dog were both overdone 

Pros: 
1) Clean environment 
2) Food was hot",12,A,Shake Shack,Shake Shack,Shake Shack,2.0
"Carlos and his wife are ABSOLUTE gems!

I am all about supporting local, family-owned business' and this is one of my favorites. I've gone here for many years now and I honestly can't believe I have yet to learn his wife's name yet. Hahaha! I say that, because she is an absolute doll! Every single time I come in, I am greeted with a welcoming smile and we always exchange pleasantries. 

Building relationships with your customers, I feel, is an extremely important factor to keep them coming back. This family does just that. She always asks me how I and my family are doing and I absolutely adore that about her! And oh man, can that woman whip up a mean cup of cafe con leche! One of the single-most delectable cups of cafe con leche I've had in the Tampa area. 

If you're looking for small bites, the papa rellenas (stuffed potatoes) is my jam! They will even open it up for you and add hot sauce if you'd like - and me likey. The beef empanadas are pretty good, too. I like my empanadas with cheese, personally, which these do not have, but I certainly do enjoy them from time to time. Guava and cheese turnovers are definitely an option, as well. 

Carlos' is definitely more known for their sandwiches - obviously, hence the name, but their breakfast sandwiches are truly the best way to start your day. Packed full of fluffy egg, yellow American cheese and your choice meat, on toasted and pressed cuban bread. If you ever find yourself riding down Columbus Dr, before you hit 50th St, stop in.

"First things first - I live outside Philly. Despite growing up in New Jersey, I consider myself a Philadelphian from living there almost 30 years. 

I am here helping my sister who just had a kidney transplant. So the thought of finding a comparable cheese steak anywhere outside of the City Of Brotherly Love is usually a disaster. Philly Phlava is an exception to that rule. Is it on par with Steve's Price of Steaks or John's Roast Pork - my hometown favorites? No. But they make a formidable cheese steak. 

The key to any great cheese steak is the roll and this shop gets Amorosa rolls sent from up north. The meat was relatively lean and tasty (they could cut back on the salt - WAY too salty).The portion of meat was ok - not stuffed but not weak. I got a steak because that was what my sister wanted and I figured I would try it(she adds green peppers to hers - a major Philly no-no). I got mine the only way a true Philadelphian would - provolone cheese and fried onions. 

I liked the Philly sports apparel on the wall. Even some of the employees come from the area (like the excellent young lady working the counter who is from Maple Shade NJ - right over the bridge).

I'm so confused...I ordered pad Thai and what I got looked nothing like it (nor tastes like it).  It was clear in color, not the typical orangey brown color and it was very sweet. Ugh!

"The food here gets 5 stars no question. We ordered many different things and everything was amazing. Major compliments to the chef and whoever created the menu.

The bad though - I'd give ambience/attitude a 1 here. Aside that one wall is open and you can see the casino and people playing and stumbling to the bar to get drinks since there's hardly ever a cw on the casino floors!

I noticed it was the bussers/water pourers who were the ones with the absolute best manners and class - and made us feel we were having an upscale experience. KUDOS to them!  I notice these things as much as my food. Our server gave good service, don't get me wrong, just was not very personable. 

The worst - the hostesses were pretentious and unfriendly/sour - the hostesses at our local Carraba's have better manners and know how to deal with patrons much better - that's a shame when you think you are having an ""upscale"" meal and have someone being snippy with you about your reservation before you're even 10 ft inside and trying to give you the absolute worst table in the restaurant after you put in the reservation it's a birthday and could we have a nice table. Oh - and NOTHING was mentioned about a birthday either - so we didn't bother say anything but it made me annoyed in a sense- why ask if it's a special occasion if they don't care/do anything special for it? Not looking for free anything - we were way beyond full for dessert -  but a Happy Bday from ANYONE would have been nice for the birthday boy.

When we left, one of the women who worked there standing at the door looked right at me as we walked out - I thought she may say thank you or goodbye etc but NOTHING - I was about to speak to her but she looked away so caught myself in time.

"Food and service were ok. However the Kennedy restaurant does not accept the sister restaurants gift card! This restaurant has been open since November of 2013.  Was given a gift card to the restaurant purchased by a friend so we decided to try it. Ordered and ate our meal. Food was good although we felt somewhat pricey for what we were getting. Service was adequate, good and unobtrusive. However problem arose when I gave the server the gift card with the credit card to pay. She returned to inform me that they were not set up to take the gift cards yet. They've been open for 8 months but still cannot take the gift cards from there sister restaurant. I asked to speak with a manager and another server came to the table and she informed me that she was also the manager. Furthermore she stated that this has happened before causing other patrons to be upset.  I stated that if they were still not set up to accept the gift cards then they should state this at the beginning of a patrons arrival. Especially if this has occurred before. I asked to speak with the owner who apparently was not there. Finally had to give them the gift receipt along with the gift card and be forceful before they issued a credit. Made for an ugly end to the meal. Would not go back. They are obviously having difficulty bringing in patrons as evidenced by the substantially less than half full restaurant on a Friday evening and if they continue to treat their new patrons as we were treated it won't be long before they are closed.",20,B,Terra Sur Restaurant & Bar,Terra Sur Restaurant & Bar,Terra Sur Restaurant & Bar Inc.,1.0

Although there were several tables available throughout the main dining room, we were seated in a semi-private room with what appeared to be a party of some sort.

Kept checking & those tables in the main dining room were never filled.  We easily could have been moved to one of them & still kept our server! 

We complained to our server & asked to see the manager.  Apparently, she was too busy to make an appearance but offered free desserts for our troubles.  Really?  We chose this restaurant for an early Valentine's dinner, but left with a ""bad taste"" in our mouth & headaches from the loud noise.

"HORRIBLE!!!! My boyfriend and I stayed at the Renaissance Hotel and had breakfast here. First of all, the hostess was flighty, had us follow her twice to tables that were not ready, she barely spoke a word to us. Someone spilled a glass of water all of the table and floor behind the table we finally got. It took at least 45 minutes for people to clean up the spilled water and that was only after the flighty hostess sat a couple there. Of course they complained about the water. The manager walked by the mess on the floor numerous times and did nothing. Only when the couple sat at that table and complained did he act on the puddle. I should've slipped in the puddle and caused a scene. Let's talk about the food, shall we? Available buffet or order from a menu ( which we never got by the way). Watery eggs, bacon was flavorless, sausage was dry. My boyfriend ordered an omelet. He said is was the worst he's had in awhile.

The locks and bagles sandwich is good, but the bagle is not toasted (which is a little odd to us) I'm sure it wouldn't be a problem if we asked, but it always seems to slip our mind. 
I've had the brisket sliders before and they are very good. The meat is tender and flavor is good. However it says they have horseradish,  but I couldn't taste any.

The real reason we come back to this particular restaurant (other than a delicious bowl French onion) is for the server Robert. He makes the experience smooth and delightful, remembers what we normally order, and offers great recommendations when we decide to try something new. We've has a few other servers here which were dry and slow in comparison.

"Well.  This is one fancy lookin' joint.  It's highly ornamented, and clearly vintage.  The lobby is impressive.  

The rooms are... Ridiculous.  I'd much rather have a higher quality mattress and duvet than a fancy carved head-and-footboard, or the decorative satin foot-of-the-bed-runner (is that what that's called? That thing that's not a blanket?). The beds are stiff and uncomfortable.  The bedding is....   Sloppy?  One of the beds was semi-short-sheeted because the size of the sheets didn't seem to allow full width coverage.  The tub faucet was rather dangling off the wall.  The in-room hotel guide is just a stack of pages stapled together, and had clearly been handled by a number of guests.

It is clean, it is functional. The Elevators work and are speedy to/from the upper floors.  The hot water stays hot through two showers at least.  The towels are clean and fluffy (but only 2 provided).  I did not notice any adjacent-room noise or other audible disturbances. 

There's no in-room coffee?!?!!

The ""free parking"" is an adjacent unregulated, unattended lot.  

It's trying so desperately to be ""classy"".  Instead it's just tacky.  Pity, really... The building itself deserves better.

If 3 chunks of Pure bacon fat is what you call bacon then this is the one for you. Tasteless tomatoes and dripping in grease. First bite was a nasty surprise. Still couldnt eat it after removing the fat slabs. I basically had french fries for dinner.

So after doing an eye exam on my wife's brother-in-law  AKA my sister-in-law's husband (i.e. not my brother), he, my sister-in-law, and I went to Chico's. The place was nearly deserted, even though I would consider 1:30pm still prime lunch time. 

The complimentary chips arrived and this sparked a brief discussion about the fact that they were red, white, and blue. It was suggested that this was in support of the USA in the World Cup, but since they serve them this way all the time, I think it is just an effort to try to be more festive, and less authentic. Yes, blue corn chips do exist, and Red Hot Blues are probably my favorite corn chips ever.  But these aren't as good as those. The salsa was liquidy.

Maybe they will work harder then these cashiers. Last time I ordered Bulgogi Beef and the cashier charged me $8.99. I thought the price went up and I came to find out I got Galbi. There's quite a difference between the two (including the price). Since I actually wanted to try their Galbi I let it slide that time.

This final time I decided I want to try their Oriental Chicken (based on the recommendation of Korean friends). They have 3 types, I decided to go with Mild. The cashier asked me 4 times throughout our order what type I wanted and I repeated Mild. He even wrote it down and my Oriental Chicken still came out very spicy. After I went up to bring the matter to his attention, he claimed he heard Medium...REALLY? After 4 times of repeating the order he still heard Medium? He refused to fix the order since I had a bite out of the chicken (actually telling me that I should have sampled the sauce to see if it was hot?..)

"Let's face it, I was going to give in to the tantalizing temptation at some point. It is so funny that I was running errands in the area and I stopped by off a whim. I havent had panda express in about 5 years but today I was craving their shrimp and chow mein. I had to feed the family so I stopped by and indulged in samples at first and ordered two large plates to go. I had two types of beef, honey chicken, and grilled chicken, shrimp, rice, chowmein, rangoons, and eggrolls. We enjoyed this meal fully. We had seconds and thirds. I couldn't get past how flavorful everything was. Each item was a treat and I enjoyed just sitting down and partaking in the delicious assortment on my plate. Such a wonderful meal and ideal pricing for the family.",39,C,Panda Express,Panda Express,Panda Express Inc.,3.0

Giving this mellow-mushroom a 4 star rating due to the fact that the restaurant was not very busy when I arrived and it took my waitress roughly 10 minutes to come find our table in the dark back room. Once she found us she quickly served us with the waters we requested and took our food order. We waited about 30-40 minutes for the pizza to be brought out from the kitchen to which it was very delicious! The waitress was very sparse when checking up on us so our waters ran low and didn't have anything to drink for sometime. Very cleanly restaurant except for the bathroom floor had pee stains all over from the urinal. Brought my leftover pizza home and tipped the waitress her 20% and went about my night.,38,C,Mellow Mushroom,Mellow Mushroom,M3llow Mushroom,4.0

Ordered a pasta special and 2 pieces of pie to go... was told it would only take 10 minutes. I decided to get a bowl of soup while I waited. Good thing because the service was so slow that I ended up waiting 35 minutes. Then I was shocked by the total bill... $30!! .....only to get home and find that the pieces of pie that I paid $5.50 a piece for were so tiny that they didn't even fill up half of the little take-out container.

"I'm glad Shake Shack finally decided to set up shop in Tampa! Now I don't have to go all the way to Orlando or Miami just to get it! I think overall, the quality of a burger here is good. Patties are nice and juicy with a nice little crust on the outside. The Shack Sauce gives the burger a nice tangy taste that compliments the burger patties and the various other toppings and condiments like the onions and pickles. The fries were really good as well. Nice and crispy on the outside but soft on the inside, Shake Shack fries maintain their crispy texture so well compared to other fries. Only complaint I have is seating space. This place does not have enough seating. Maybe because it just opened so it's super popular, but this place is jam packed with very little seating indoor and out. It forces you to wait not just for your food, but also for a table to open up. Maybe when the hype starts dying down it will get better. But until then, might want to take your meal to go.

The latkes were pretty good but the sour cream was more like thick cream cheese. The applesauce was definitely Motts too, so nothing crazy there. The chocolate egg cream was decent. I was really looking forward to trying the chocolate bobka but they were out.

"We found what we were hoping would be a local gem for Chinese food cravings.  Sadly, it was nowhere near what we were expecting.  

Ambiance:  Expectations were low in this area based on other reviews we read.  Therefore we were only slightly surprised.  The dining area was moderately clean.  The entire right side of the restaurant was set up for the family's use and storage the live dinner selections like fish, crabs, lobsters. The family area is fine - whatever floats your boat.  But the ""creature feature"" smelled dirty.  The water in which they are kept is cloudy and most likely perpetuated the awful smell.  The tanks were also packed full which looked like the creatures were lacking sufficient facilities to keep healthy.  We have a new rule - family area visible to the public and/or dirty creature storage = leave before being seated.  Next time we will follow this rule.

Service:  expectations were moderate in this area.  Another unfortunate occurrence though - we got wwaaaayyyyy less than we were expecting.  The couple seated at the family table were friendly and seated us quickly.  However, a couple tables away, one of the waiters was napping sitting up agains a wall.  Also, after our server dropped off the food, we never saw her again.  When we tried to ask the server questions, she did not seem to be able to give the answers we needed and possibly did not convey our requests to the kitchen.  Definitely a language barrier.  None of this was good considering my food wasn't even good enough to be called disgusting.  More on that next.

Food:  ok, so we were expecting a slightly rustic experience.  Rustic would have been welcomed compared to what we got.  One companion ordered a noodle dish - this was actually ok.  Not something I would return for, but ok.  My two other companions ordered a fried chicken dish spiced mild.  The spice was much more than mild - one ate it due to hunger, the other ate a little mixed with a lot of rice and took the rest home and will probably toss it.  The pieces of chicken had large fatty deposits that were not cooked and were rubbery inside the fried coating.  We were afraid the food was not cooked properly.  I ordered soy sauce chicken.  This was supposed to be 1/2 of a chicken cooked with soy sauced.  If the dish were at least warm, I may have slightly better things to say.  However, the food hit the table cold.  Like it was served a couple hours ago and no one put the leftovers away and left it sitting under an ac vent cold.  The fat was congealed, skin rubbery, and the bone impossible to separate from the meat.  I was unable to eat more than my first bite.  Again, due to temp, I was worried about food safety.  As our server never came to check on us, we could not ask for help.  Instead, when she dropped the bill, she asked if I wanted to take it home.  I told her no ""it was yucky & I could not eat it"".  I was still charged for it.....

Due to service, food safety issues - both live food and dead, and low food quality, we will not be returning.  Hopefully if you decide to give it a whirl, you will have a better experience.",25,B,China Yuan Restaurant,China Yuan Restaurant,china yuan restaurant,1.0

"Excellent food, wonderful atmosphere, prompt service, and an exceptional view. What is there to dislike? As I walked into the restaurant, I was greeted promptly by one of the managers, Rachel and was seated right away. I started off with the blueberry mojito and it was perfect.(mixed by Rachel) It was a wonderful medley of Bacardi, mint, lemon-lime soda, and blueberry mixed so well that I wanted to order 3 more. Next was the calamari. It was a wonderful serving, thicker than what most restaurants serve and VERY delicious. I am very picky when it comes to calamari but this delightful appetizer put all my doubts to rest. Topped with sun dried tomatoes, sage, feta cheese, and accompanied with lemon dill aioli, this calamari is unlike any other. When my cheeseburger arrived, I was so full from the calamari, I feared that I would not be able to enjoy this american classic. My burger was crafted perfectly and the presentation was lovely. My tastebuds were delighted as I took my first bite of my swiss cheeseburger and the wonderful view of the Channelside waterfront was just a plus to my dining experience at Fusion at Flambe.

For the average American, the place can put one off, but someone from Trinidad, it brings a slice of island life to the states. Whether you're drinking a Shandy Ginger, Apple J, or some Kola Champagne, most likely CC has your drink. One can even get Sorrel here.

The food is something that you tongue will praise you for. The Pepper Shrimp is amazing. Granted it is not for the faint of heart (or tongue), but the flavors do not stop. The Shrimp Fried Rice is just as good. I also recommend the Curry Beef with Roti.

"Atmosphere: Lovely! We stayed in their outdoor seating area. I loved their lighting decor and the large tables. Perfect for a girls night out or date night spot.

Food: We ordered during happy hour on a weeknight. We ordered: Pan Con Tomate (similar to bruschetta), Baba Ganoush (similar to hummus & toasted flatbread), Casa Ceviche, Calamari, Albondigas (chorizo, pork, veal meatballs), Lomo de Puerco (pork tenderloin with arugula and an olive spread), Churros (with an espresso, chocolate sauce) and white and red sangrias.
Everything tasted amazing! The calamari was very crispy and seasoned well. I loved the ceviche - it wasn't too sour and the seafood tasted very fresh! I loved how the churros had a hint of espresso - it definitely sets them apart from other places that serves churros with plain caramel or chocolate sauce. The sangrias were good but were kind of lacking in the alcohol department. I barely tasted any alcohol.

Service: The food and drinks were served fairly quickly. Our server wasn't too friendly. She never smiled at all. Maybe she was having a bad day?

"Yeoman's Road Pub is the place in Tampa for the lager and ale afficianado. With about 90 choices, some rotation, and a casual atmosphere including the defining Davis Islands sidewalk (and sideway) seating where chances are you'll see someone you know walking by--in three years I couldn't find somewhere I'd rather sit down to a nice brew. As Luke said, locals in effect, that'd be true for much of Davis Islands, and Yeoman's in particular will have more of the TGH shift change/realtor, etc crowd than the sports-bar crowd across the street, if that means anything or is your fancy. You've got your plastic (read: fake for those who associate English pubs with steel-tip, but it is Florida, so save 'em for Four Green Fields if you're desperate). Food is English pub: simple and tastey, like your reuben (is that the Prince Charles? I forget now), patty melt, good burgers. The sandwiches come with chips (american chips), but opt for the sweet potato fries, a half-basket is enough for two people, and they're better than most place's. Check the chalkboard on the sidewalk for specials, they're good and they're cheap. If you need English non-pub food, and it's during the day weekdays, the European Cafe is the place, which you probably passed on the way to Davis Islands. Open mic night can be interesting: you can always step outside for the 15 mintues they're given if you need to take an aspirin (this isn't Austin and Tampa forbids street musicians, you know); although some groups get a good start--one in particular moved on to getting paid well for Friday night stints next door then they toured the Southeast (and I still have their CD). They've rotated through a few bartenders and servers in my time, back in '05 I had many conversations with the bartender who happened to be a brewmaster. But basically all have been pleasant and good even if not an expert in beer, and always count on the owner, he knows his stuff. I was saying to a friend how a certain milk stout was too sweet and weak on the body (that's about the limits of my beer terminology but I do know it when I taste it), and he chimed in that he agreed completely. And that's Davis Islands, too, if you don't go over much--the business owners are part of their businesses. Forget the office, you'll find them in the thick of things doing their books. If things haven't changed, ashtrays come out at 11:00pm when the kitchen closes. The TV's usually have on baseball or MMA. A few more recommendations: Three philosophers (quad-belgian with a touch of cherry lambic); the pumpkin ale in the fall is good on tap; you can't say you've had beer if you haven't tried delerium tremens (the hoppy belgian, even if it's not my style); there's a double chocolate stout if you're in for something deep after your meal; try something local from the Dunedin brewery, they're all pretty good; and lastly, have something from a true English pub--Samuel Smith's brown ale is your standard. All of these (or most) will be on their beer list; usually it's not floating around and you have to ask for it. Since it lists not just the beer but the details, you can try something new. For the main-landers, remember to head over to Channel Drive to walk it off, and you'll then be able to find your card back at the parking lot behind the L-shaped courtyard building with the fountain.",8,A,Yeoman's Road Restaurant,Yeoman's Road Restaurant,yeoman's road restaurant,5.0

"Such a disappointment, service and food was awful. We had to wait an hour and a half to get our food, the mofongo was just boiled plaintains with no flavor at all. We had to ask other waiters around for drink refills because our waitress was no where to be found. When the food did arrive, all of the orders of mofongo were completely soggy and not one person in our party was satisfied with their meal. The steak mofongo was so bad that we had to send it back. The waitress did not apologize nor ask us if we had enjoyed our meals at all, she asked us if we wanted to take it home in a box... why would we want to take home food that was awful??

Tried the insalata pizza and the tagliatelle pasta entrees.

Loved the insalata pizza, crust was perfectly crisp, great garlic flavor, combination of fennel, arugula, capers was great and it was perfectly dressed with a citrus vinaigrette. 

The pasta dish was a bit disappointing, didn't really get any truffle flavor, and it could have used a bit more seasoning in general, just tasted like a buttery fettuccine dish. But the pasta was nicely cooked.

"On the plus side, we had a pretty good meal for airport food.  The food was very fresh, well prepared (broiled fish sandwich, grilled chicken sandwich, fries and side salads), and tasted good. The prices were tolerable.  (The side salad was tiny, and not good value--in case you like salad.) The atmosphere is a bit odd, but not uncomfortable: a cross between a lounge/sports bar/restaurant. The service was acceptable, although it was a bit hard to get our server's attention because she was so busy.

Equally important, there were no better options that were remotely as convenient.  There are a couple fast food places, and a couple chain places with bad, overpriced food (Hard Rock Cafe and PF Changs). Or you can drive/taxi several miles to various off-site restaurants.

"My wife and I frequented PF Changs often when they opened this location. I would consider the menu to be Asian fusion.  Food overall is ok, but definitely not as flavorful as you might expect. May be why we're do not dune here as often. 
 
Either way, we usually start with wonton soup, which has chicken, shrimp and wontons (not everyone will like this dish).

Main courses are Changs spicy chicken, Mapo Tofu, and Mongolian beef.

Changs spicy chicken is not very spicy and oftentimes is more like sweet and sour chicken.  This is fine since our daughter loves it.  Last couple of times the chicken had a weird chewy texture?

The Mongolian beef is good especially with the large green onions/scallions.  However, beware of being overcooked as this will make the beef very chewy.

My wife loved the mapo tofu until I learned to make it at home and now we are left unimpressed by the PF Chang version.  I still like the PFC version too, but definitely not spiced like the home version.  For you vegetarians out there, you may like this dish quite a bit. 

No disrespect, but the food is ""watered down"" and inconsistent (different chefs?). Some of this has to do with how dishes are seasoned, both for saltiness and spice.  I get they have to tone it down based on the wide range of people they serve, but sometimes it can be bland. 

Overall service is generally good, but the lighting is definitely on the dark side.  If you're having lunch, the glare outside will make you squint a bit.   Keep in mind many of the dishes are large and can be shared.

So I changed it out to a porterhouse.  30 mins later, they brought out a cold rare steak when I said I wanted medium.  So I waited 50 mins for a steak that wasn't cooked. So they brought it back and brought out another rare steak. Then the last time I think they put it on the grill finally and actually grilled it.

Next the coffee was the real reason and not to disappoint it it a star.   Multipke refills and subsequent unisex bathroom breaks.  They also have some flavor combos that (although I am still contemplating if they are for me) are so creative in the creative process!  Wow!  Sparkling coffee is a must try.

Next visit was the vegan veggie sandwich and a ginger spiced latte.    Sandwich is beyond hmmmm good....it is groaningly delicious!    Ginger spiced latte is good, as a lover of ginger I will ask for double ginger next order.

However, I'm just not a fan of this concept, and I can't really understand how this place has made it after all these years. I can't lie, I did a small ""hell yeah"" fist pump when the Oldsmar location went belly up. It's wrong, I know, but I grew up being forced to eat fondue at home. I didn't care for it then and probably care less for it now. It has always amazed me that people would pay these prices for minuscule portions AND to have to cook it themselves. Imagine going to Publix and paying $9 for a sub only to have them point you to a sandwich making station where a single slice of deli meat and cheese was eagerly awaiting assembly. Well that's what this is like. Why does a small boiling caldron of vegetable oil make this acceptable????

"So I've known about this place for a long time, but never went until today. As a first try, I had a Large Cuban Sandwich, no lettuce, no pickles.  Disclaimer - I am very picky about Cuban Sandwiches.  Don't get me started about ""all the way"" Cuban Sandwiches.  I grew up in Miami, maybe we have a different definition down there, but there are never any lettuce or tomatoes.
First, the good.  Friendly, family owned business; we need more of these places in Tampa. Good bread - the key to any Cuban Sandwich. Fast service.
The not as good - the bread was pressed and toasted nicely, but not enough to heat the meat through or melt the cheese completely. A common error, but an error none-the-less. Then the meat. The ham was good quality, and the salami, too. The roast pork (the prime ingredient in any Cuban) consisted of one slice of meat. Now, I would normally say that sliced meat is inferior to roasted, pulled pork on a Cuban, but it at least has to be noticeably present.  In this case, it was barely there.  Unacceptable.
In summary, I like the place. I will probably try it again. I probably won't get a Cuban again. It will do in a pinch, but there are better choices if I want to drive further.",1,A,Victoria's,Victoria's,Victori@'s,3.0

"I REALLY like this place.  I've only been once, but I love the concept, the people and the end product.  High quality ingredients at working stations with recipes YOU follow and make yourself.  Then, you take the food home, freeze it and cook it later.  All you need to do is go to the grocery store and buy some side dishes, and BOOM!  Dinner is done.

When I went, there were about 30 of us, and there was plenty of elbow room for us all to whip up our meals.  The prep tables are big and the work stations are sanitary as well as orderly.  The staff did an exceptional job directing traffic considering most of the 30 had never worked in a restaurant environment before.  Hats off!

"Not a bad place for a fast lunch, but it wasn't the best Jamaican food. 

I love goat curry.  This place is closer and with more parking than any of the other Jamaican restaurants I've tried, so I checked them out.

It is definitely a hole in the wall, mom and pop kind of place.  Cleanliness is suspect.

One problem is that not all food is kept simmering.  My yams and collards were hot.  The goat curry was microwaved, and it was served lukewarm. Very disappointing.   The collards were bland and could have used either more pepper or acid. The yams were good.

Portions are huge.  But I'd rather have less food that tasted better.",26,B,Lorna's One Stop Jerk Center Restaurant,Lorna's One Stop Jerk Center Restaurant,Lorn@'s One Stop Jerk Center Rest@ur@nt,3.0

"I've ordered from Wing Zone a couple times. As a fan of wings - ok, mostly boneless wings which aren't usually wings in the true sense - I wanted to give these folks a try. I ordered online both times. I find online ordering is usually less painless and more precise. Both times, the orders came in a reasonable amount of time. I tried several flavors, some directly on the wings, some on the side. All of the flavors were bold and good. The wings and the tenders were nicely sized and very good. The surprise standout here to me was actually the cheeseburger. It's hard to find a good delivery burger. Not many places deliver them, and when they do, it's hard to maintain the quality. The burger here was hot, fresh and tasty. And, it was a good size portion. Toppings were served on the side, allowing hot to be hot and cold to be cold. I even added garlic parm sauce on the burger, and believe it or not that was a great addition. Tried a couple of the sides as well - onion rings, wedge fries - all good. I only wish they offered unsweet tea as well as sweet tea - that would be a bonus. If you're in New Tampa, I'd recommend giving them a try for the variety of the menu alone.",27,B,Wing Zone,Wing Zone,Wing Zone,4.0
"Meeting our dietary needs when eating out is pretty dang hard.  I'm a meat eater and my boyfriend is vegan.  

We had stopped to eat here before seeing a movie at the Tampa Theatre which is walking distance from the restaurant and the parking lot down the block.

For drinks we both ordered a house margarita on the Rocks; it was good!  The tequila wasn't bad for being house tequila and the mix wasn't overly sweet and sugary.  And you could taste the tequila.  For the second round I got strawberry which I didn't know cost a little extra.  I don't recommend the strawberry just stick with traditional lime.

We ordered guacamole to go with the chips and salsa they bring on the house to the table.  We were very pleased with the flavor!  Chips with tasty and crunchy, salsa not too spicy if you're afraid of some kick, and same with the guacamole.  Only disappointing thing about he appetizer was the thickness of the chips.  Just a little too thick for my taste.

The vegan ordered the veggie fajitas which did not disappoint in size and flavor!  I ordered a variety of tacos, 2 steak and 1 pork.  The steak tacos were INCREDIBLE however the carnitas were a little dry and disappointing.

"Had to stop here for a sandwich, I was in need of a quick food break to go back to my hotel, and continue with some late work.. So i did not weight options, and had zero expectations - a slice of pizza would have worked just as well. I just walked to wherever there was food.

Before anything, I don't live here and this is my first, (and last) time at Sula's... the place had the most BRUTAL burnt-oil-fryer smell, I got a cuban to-go and literally had to wait outside on the street.  The 2 minutes it took me to order, and pickup the food after my wait was enough to stink up my clothes, and hotel room with the same brutal oil smell.  I kid you not, This was the most powerful frying oil smell i've ever encountered, truly borderline toxic.

The chicken tasted like nothing. The steak was tough with a surprising amount of sinew. Also tasteless. In fact the entire entree pallet of meat was tasteless. I ended up spitting out most of it. The court boullion Tasted exactly like those boullion cubes we used to get as a kid. The dessert chocolate fondue didn't taste like chocolate more like choco syrup.

Very disappointed . First of all, when this location was Grill 116 , it was modern & trendy. Something Tampa is lacking. Since it was all re-done we thought it would be an upgrade but now it has an old people feel to it. Why?!
It looks like a seafood restaurant but decor is old people cafeteria ( so is the music .) We think the theme is supposed to be an Italian restaurant but still not sure.

We ordered a $13 BLT that had all lettuce and literally one piece of bacon on it. I ordered mimosas but the champagne was completely flat . I had to return my cocktail 3 times & finally gave up - we decided to leave and just go somewhere else. Even that didn't work out. It took forever to get a staff member to bring us a check .

We start with devil egg. The dish come with three half egg. I ask if they can accommodate one half egg t make it four pieces and we will pay for extra pieces. The restaurant was not able to accommodate. I like their house cure salmon on the egg. We also got the eggplant meatball. The sauce is good. I like the bedding zucchini noodle below.

"No doubt about it: if you're looking for the best pizza in the USF area, you'll find it at CDB's. The pizzas here are piled ridiculously high with toppings. 

Fact #1: I can eat a LOT of food. 
Fact #2: I can only eat two--maybe two and a half--pieces of a large CDB's pizza before tapping out.

The ""Bee"" Meat Lovers Special is definitely the best pizza here... it's a carnivore's fantasy pizza. The A-T-FM seems to be popular with my friends, but I'm not a fan. 

I've never really enjoyed the atmosphere here--hence the one star deduction. It's also weird to walk in and awkwardly wait to be seated. I feel like the waitresses should do a better job of watching for guests who need to be seated.

On the other hand, they were playing holiday movies projected up on the side of the building next door for their patrons to enjoy during dinner. That was a sweet touch.

As for the food, everything was pretty good. Excellent truffle fries, and my family says the fish and chips are some of the best in town. I had an Indian curry dish which was surprisingly tasty! I felt like their was a modge podge of foods on the menu, so I was skeptical I'll admit. But it was quite good and had a powerful kick!

I'm going out on a limb here but I'd bet all the traffic issues blamed on this magnificent structure are related to people's inattentive driving, people texting, people gawking, people speeding, people stopping on the bridge, people who don't maintain their vehicles, etc.

How fortunate we are to have these well engineered mammoth structures to make our commutes possible not always pleasant but possible.

"This is not the best Mexican food you'll ever have, but it is pretty good, and it is ridiculously cheap.

I came here on Mark P's advice (and review).  It really is in the middle of nowhere, but in the middle of the day, it's no big deal.

There was a mariachi band playing, but luckily they were focused on an area separate from where I sat, so I could eat relatively undisturbed.  The waitress was quick and friendly.  I don't think she spoke much English, but for me, that's not a big deal.

I had a large pina aqua fresca (very good), and three tacos.  All three were pretty okay, not the best I've had, but solid for Tampa.  If you use a lot of lime juice and judicious hot sauce, they are more than acceptable.  The green sauce is rather tasteless, so go with the red sauce.  I liked the lengua the best of my three meats (lengua, asada and carnitas), but for me, lengua is almost always the winner based on its inherent fatty goodness.

"TL;DR
I don't like this place. Please go somewhere else for food. Even if it's another Burger King. Just not this one.

I have no words. I have given this particular establishment multiple chances, but haven't improved in the several years I've seen them.

Technical issues? All their lights, including the sign in front were turned off. If y'all're having issues then why remain open? It just shows a lack of respect and responsibility.

Poor service. The woman running the drive-thru, at 8:00pm on September 7th, was rude. Refusing to spare me a moment to let me tell her my order. I was interrupted multiple times when trying to order the 2 for $10 meals. Could she not just stay quiet and listen? Why must I repeat the first of two sandwiches five times while you interrupt me? I didn't mind waiting when I first pulled up, I understand if you may be busy at the current moment, but that doesn't excuse your blatant disrespect.

In the past, I've been yelled at as an introduction, kept waiting unnecessarily, and now disrespected when all I've shown is patience.

The inside is nice and quiet, though a bit chilly. The outside is a bar area with music, volleyball, and a nice view of the water. Besides smelling like beer and cigarettes, the place is quite lively. Lively enough for almost a fight. As a matter of fact, some guy almost beat up another until some manager-dude broke it up.

"Visited Tampa and decided to check out Farmacy vegan.  I researched their website a few days before my trip and must say that I was surprised when I walked in.  I walked in to a grocery store (not vegan, but after walking through the grocery there is a section for Farmacy Vegan.  There were two to three small tables.  
I was disappointed as I thought this was a restaurant instead it's more tailored to grab and go.  I ordered the avocado wrap.  I purchased it around 1:00 pm but wasn't able to eat it until 8. I paired it with a plant based protein shake.  The wrap was okay.   It came with a dipping sauce which I did not like. I tried it but didn't like it. The wrap had tempeh in it and veggies, it wasn't bad but it wasn't great either.

"I would give NO stars if possible. I am absolutely through with olive garden! My mom loves Olive Garden, and the one where she lives in Avon Park is good, the people who work there are actually competent, they get the orders right, the place is clean and they don't try to poison people by contaminating their dish. The one here by Busch gardens is the exact OPPOSITE. I honestly don't know why we've given them so many chances to actually get it right. there are always issues there, but tonight was the final straw. I went with my mother and her friend, after a day at the park, we had to wait a few minutes which isn't a big deal, however their outside waiting area is FILTHY, like it definitely hasn't been swept this month at all as there are cigarette butts, dead flowers all over the place,and COBB WEBS basically anchoring the benches to the ground. Not a good start, but not the end of the world. We finally are seated and our waitress takes our drink orders, simple limonatas all around, she comes back and takes our meal order, still don't have any drinks... My salad comes out.... still no drinks. Finally we get those, and few minutes later my mom and her friend get their soups, except there wasn't ONE gnocchi in the chicken and gnocchi soup my mom's friend ordered, OR in the one they brought my mom even though she ordered minestrone...... the waitress brings the soups to get them fixed and shows up with our meals saying she will bring the soups AFTER the meal... not necessary because that's not the correct order. My mom tells her to just forget the soups. We begin eating, my paparedelle portabella was slightly undercooked but tolerable, I'm not a fan of sending my plate back, so I decided to just eat it, my mom's friends Alfredo was pretty dry , but again tolerable, so she was eating it anyway. As I was almost done, I bit into something strange tasting, and then realized it was a piece of PORK in my VEGETARIAN dish. I spit it out into a napkin, and had to rush to their bathroom to vomit, had I not already been going to, the smell of urine in there would've done it anyway. I return to find my mom speaking with the manager who was basically trying to downplay the issue rather than admitting that it is not an okay thing to have happen. He has absolutely no control over front or back of the house and it's VERY apparent. I was very upset and he was making it worse, so I excused myself and went outside. They removed MY meal from the bill and gave my mom a 20 gift card, as if that is somehow supposed to even the score. I honestly hope this place gets shut down. If you have any sort of allergies or important dietary restrictions (vegetarian or religious) stay FAR away from this ridiculous excuse for a dining establishment.

"I had always been a huge supporter of Estella's for about 10 years. That all ended when my wife and I went for an early dinner on Monday evening. 

Having been a regular for years we sort of had a routine of chips and queso, salsas (including the hotter on for me) followed by our meals which we would take most of home. 

This week was no different. The wife ordered her 2 tacos and I the #1 combo with beef. After filling up on the chips and salsa I wound up only having the taco there and brought the 2 burritos and rice home. As we left my wife wanted to go to the little ice cream shop down the street. 

No sooner had we gotten inside the ice cream shop and a bout of food poisoning stated up. It's now been over 40 hrs since the leaving the restaurant and the fever, stomach pain and other even more undesirable symptoms still exist. This is the worst bout of food poisoning I can ever remember having. I know for a fact that the poising came from the meal I/we ate at Estella's on Monday 3/26. My guess is the contaminated item on this visit was the spicy salsa since its the only thing I had which the wife did not.

Since reading some other reviews where others having repeatedly gotten food poising at multiple of their locations ...... I'll NEVER go again. I have had problems with about a dozen visits to Estella's over the last 10 years where I'd have immediate stomach issues thereafter but never really chalked it up the food quality or food poisoning for one reason or another. Looking back on it now, the last visit prior to this one also left myself and a coworker with food poisoning after having lunch at the location on S Dale Mabry.

"I just relocated here with work and I was starving with absolutely no clue on where to grab some food. On the fridge of the airbnb in which I'm staying was a flyer for Xpress Pizza and Subs. So I jumped online and checked out the menu. I ordered wings and a calzone. Delivery was slower than I would have liked, but that was of no fault to the owners. There was a glitch in the online ordering but after calling, they were extremely apologetic and threw in a slice of their red velvet cake.
Folks!!! Hands down the very best wings I've ever eaten. I immediately called back to the restaurant and praised the wings. All hale to the wings. 
The calzone was delicious and a very healthy portion at that. I was just so taken by the size of the wings, the bold 'hot' flavor and they were piping hot upon delivery. 
Super nice people at Xpress Pizza and Subs and their quality and taste of food matches their wonderful personalities.
Thanks!

"In town from Houston for business. I chose Bua Thai for dinner because im staying downtown.  I loved it.  I eat a lot of Thai food in Houston (and NYC) and have a pretty discriminating palate.  

I ordered the lemon Thai soup with tofu and ordered it ""hot"".  The owner (a while 50-ish male) said they have mild, medium, hot, and Thai hot. I chose hot.  The soup was absolutely perfect - with cilantro, cubed tofu, tomato chunks, mushrooms, etc.  It was very fresh and simply delicious.  My main course was tofu with veggies - also hot.  The portion was generous, and included broccoli, carrots, cabbage, tofu, etc. in a brown sauce.  It arrived with steamed white rice formed in the shape of a heart.  The food was very good and reasonably priced.

Now the ""bad."" I arrived at 6 pm and was the only customer.  When I left at 7, there were 3-4 other tables.  In all fairness, it was Monday night in downtown Tampa.  If you are looking for a place to meet other people, this does not appear to be the place to go.  But the food was excellent.  Also, my waitress was a very young (16?) Taiwanese girl who spoke broken English.  She was very nice and attentive.  But she had a little difficulty understanding my order (I ordered my tofu steamed instead of deep fried).

"Located by the side streets off Courtney Campbell Bridge, this food truck dishes out some fine Puerto Rican dishes.  Sit on the plastic tables and chairs loosely set by the truck, or eat out of your car.  Regardless Sabor del Caribe certainly does bring the street vendor feel to your gastronomical experience.  The menu is not a lengthy extravaganza, however every item, they do served, is a plateful of delicious goodies.   The Empanadas are piping hot, perfectly balanced fried without excess grease and stuffed full of your choice of meat - pork or beef.   The pork plate is served with tender chunks of pork - which at the first taste exude aromas and tenderness only - if you had a Puerto Rican grandma, would cook.  The rice and beans that accompany are steeped in equal aromatics and explosive taste on every bite.

The prices are reasonable and balance the quality of food.  They folks operating the truck have heavy accents but are very friendly to order to and will even explain the dishes to you.  During my visit,  I was the only non-spanish speaking patron but I did not feel out of place or alienated.  The other patrons struck up a conversation with me that was wonderful.

"This place is really good! The food here is your typically mom and pop Chinese food store with the huge menu. I come here for the chicken wings and love how flexible they are with customizing your meal. The place is small, it can seat about 15 people. Its a takeout place so don't expect anything fancy. 

I got fried chicken wings tossed in General Tso sauce(instead of the honey or buffalo sauce) with white rice. I'm not a fan of fried rice so I never get it. I appreciate the fact that they cut the wings in half. My order came with four pieces of chicken wings and they tasted great, like always lol! I've ordered the honey wings in the past and they were good too! My total came up to $7.44 (they charge extra for the General Tso sauce)

"My girlfriend is an avid fan of Turkish food so we tried the new restaurant Shish Kebab and Turkish Cuisine on West Hillsoborogh last night. We were both pretty hopeful that we had found a new hidden gem so that we could have a new local spot to go to quite often. We left somewhat disappointed. Perhaps they are still working out the kinks, since they only opened a month ago, or maybe it was just the night that we were there but the service was definitely a bit off and there were some quirks with several of the dishes that we ordered as well. 

We started with a couple appetizers in the Shepard Salad and the Babaganush. I would say both were okay but not great. The Shepard Salad was not served based on the description that was listed on the menu having left off a few of the ingredients. We could tell and it just seemed like it needed something else. 

For entree's we ordered the Doner Kebab and a Chicken Shish Kebab. Both were good but not great. To be more specific ... items that were to be served with the Chicken Shish Kebab's didnt come out and we had to ask for them specifically (then actually pull out the menu to point out to the server that there indeed was a problem). By the time these items were brought out it was near the end of our dinner so we were getting full. The Doner Kebab was good but I'd say a little more than 1/2 the lamb served was overdone and char grilled / crunchy. This effected the outcome of this dish greatly. 

Overall, our experience at this new Turkish restaurant was a little bit bumpy but because my girl is such a big fan of Turkish food, we'll definitely give this local establishment another shot. All the problems or bumps we saw are definitely fixable things and like a mentioned in the opening ... hopefully they were a product of just having opened not long ago. If they can get it together then it will definitely be a gem. There are many options in the area for really good Mediterranean food but hardly any for good Turkish food. The only other that we are aware of is Gengiz Khan and even with the service blips ...

Popped in after mass next door for a glass of wine for me and a fancy coffee and cookie for the husband. Total with tip was about $20. So not terribly pricey but definitely not a bargain night. For that $20 though, he really enjoyed his iced chocolate hazelnut Illy-brand mocha and his chocolate chip cookie. I enjoyed my generous pour of Sonoma Coast California Chardonnay and we lounged on uber comfortable leather chairs with our feet up. 
For the purposes of this review  I tasted his chocolate chip cookie. It was wonderfully chocolatey without overdoing it. It was crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. There was a strong butter element and a hint of sea salt at the end. Well done.
I wouldn't, however, order a croissant. Today's selection looks rather dry.

We called the number listed online and no one answered, but a couple minutes later someone called me back from a New York number stating they were the pizza place. Lucky for them, apparently no one else around Bush Gardens in Tampa is either 1. Open mondays or 2. Delivers. So they were a last resort to begin with. So when they called back we just went with it. Not reading the reviews first because... we were hungry!
Placed our order with them at 5:05, and promised cash at delivery. They promised us a 40 minute return time and that sounded good to us. About an hour and ten minutes later I called to ""check up."" They stated they were busy and it was on its way... being a business owner myself, I understand that and went back to working on my computer. 
About twenty mins till the two hour mark they stated called me back saying they were running behind and offered me cake. Cool, free cake!
Told myself if they weren't here by 7:20 I would call them and cancel the order and just go get food.. by now I'm freaking starving!!
I kid you not.. he showed up at 7:19. Laughing I accepted our pizza!
Here is the good part now.. opened the pizza, part of it was missing. Like it got stuck on the pizza oven or something. My wings had no ranch or blue cheese sauce, and our marinara for the cheese sticks was cold. Not even slightly warmed up.
Oh well tho.. starving we ate it up.
About ten mins into shoving our faces tho.. THEY CALLED ME! They called to check on how the food was. Honestly I told them sauce was missing for the wings and the pizza looked damaged but we ate it anyways.. INSTEAD of saying ""we are sorry to hear that."" .....she hung up on me!!!!

What?!! THE?? HELL? Just happened??? Lol

My girlfriend had never been to the famous Oxford Exchange, so we ventured on over to cross a restaurant off her bucket list. Unfortunately for some reason, Oxford Exchange had an insanely long hour wait on a Sunday afternoon. I guess I don't hang around this area enough to know how popular it really is. 

Luckily, the gf spotted OE Market while we were looking for parking, so we walked on over. I was a bit skeptical, based on the price for some of the juices in the cooler. Some of them were like $10-$20, which non-literally, left a bad taste in my mouth.

But I ordered the JR sandwich, because anything with red meat and horse radish is always going to be an obvious choice for me. The result? One of the best 2-3 sandwiches available in Tampa Bay. I just could not believe how perfect it was. 

And just like you'll find at the original OE, you can score the freshly cut, sweet potato ""chips,"" which are heavenly.

Zoes Kitchen specializes in Mediterranean cuisine and is located in a new plaza off South Howard in Soho next to a pilates studio, Bulla Gastrobar, Green Lemon, Daily Eats, and Haven. Zoes Kitchen is a semi casual restaurant where you wait in a line to place your order at the register and a server brings your food out when it is ready. Zoes kitchen serves soups, salads, kabobs, pita wraps, piadinhas which are greek style quesadillas, rice bowls, and Mediterranean Family Meal combos that can serve 3-5 people. As a big fan of Greek food, i thought I've pretty much tried it all, but i was pleasantly surprised that Zoes Kitchen offered a new take on some greek favorites of mine and introduced me to some new dishes I've never tried before!

My favorite dish was the Harissa Salmon Pita which consisted of a pita topped with a harissa marinated salmon, house made tzatziki sauce, Moroccan harissa, mediterranean relish, cabbage feta and fresh dill. 

I also had the Rustic Lamb Pita which consisted of a pita topped with lamb and beef meatballs, house made tzatziki sauce, Italian salsa verde, Mediterranean relish, cabbage, feta, and fresh dill. 

I also had the tossed greek salad with grilled chicken, pasta salad, caramelized onions, tomatoes, cucumbers, red onions, bell peppers, feta, olives, and a delicious greek style salad dressing.  I paired the greek salad with the hummus trio of basil pesto, harissa red pepper, and classic hummus.

The shredded chicken arepa was not as flavorful, but still good. 

Today I got my kiddo the empanadas. The beef and cheese, and chicken and cheese. She didn't like them. It's not the kind of empanada she's familiar with. It might have been too authentic for her. I thought it was ok but I would stick to the arepa. 

She also had the chicken nuggets and fries and enjoyed them a lot, very substantial portions - so if you want to try something new but are afraid your kids can't handle it, they do have standards kids fare. 

I hope they do well, the first night I was the only customer there. Today there were a few more ppl. I wish they had a greater selection of hot sauce, but aside from that, they make authentic food. 

It's not cheap though, the arepas I love in Vegas are a good bit cheaper, but then again, I don't know anywhere else in Tampa where you can get these. 

You should definitely give it a try!",19,B,La Mansion de La Arepa,La Mansion de La Arepa,La Mansion d3 La Ar3pa,5.0

"Based upon the reviews I was expecting some fairly extraordinary food, and I was not disappointed. Everything we had was top notch. The complexity of the recipes and quality of the ingredients is definitely far above most Vietnamese restaurants I've been to.

At a recent lunch we worked our way through many appetizer courses, beginning with the fresh shrimp rolls and the mini crispy spring rolls. Both were elevated by the inclusion of very flavorful and fresh herbs.

Tuna Tai Chanh was a wonderful tuna tartare that was mixed with an unusually large amount of chopped fresh herbs that gave it a complex flavor, elevating it far about the tuna and sesame oil base. 

We also tried two special. Pheasant pate was an excellent rough country style pate served with traditional French accompaniments of mustard, gherkins and chopped onions. Truffled burrata cheese was also nicely done, with a sort of pesto or chimichurri accompaniment.

For an entree I had the grilled pork banh mi. I'm a particular fan of that sandwich, and this one was as good as any I've had, with lots of fresh herbs, a savory soy marinade, and just the right amount of creamy mayonnaise.

I'm not sure I'd describe anything I had as ""fusion"" cuisine. Most of the dishes are gourmet Vietnamese, and the two specials we had were French, but I didn't detect any fusing going on.

The wine list is reasonably priced and offers some nice choices. The Puligny Montrachet went well with the food, although not as well as the Chateau Carbonneau that we brought. The $30 corkage seemed a bit steep, but otherwise I thought the food pricing was very reasonable. I can only assume those complaining about the prices were expecting Vietnamese sandwich shop and the ingredients here mark this as a very fine dining restaurant that happens to serve lunch, too.",18,B,Restaurant BT,Restaurant BT,Rest@ur@nt BT,5.0

"This is just another reminder of why I don't go to Tampa clubs. This place is the worst. Let me paint you a picture of pure garbage. 

Issue 1 was at the door. There was a celebrity appearance so the happy hour price was $20 for bottom shelf and $40 for top shelf. However, if you were not drinking, they still wanted to charge $20. I kept asking is this a cover or a happy hour special and no one could answer. 

The bouncer at the door was a straight up liar. First, he said beer was included in the happy hour/cover price. Then, he said Absolut was bottom shelf. Lies. All lies. 

So after paying $20 for the ""cover,"" one would presume they were stepping into a nice bar. This place is in shambles. The bathrooms were like a scene from a horror film even though it was early in the night. There was poop and toilet paper everywhere. 

On the patio, you can sit at a table if no one has reserved it. How much is a reservation you ask? $100. Now, this wouldn't have annoyed me so much if the tables were at least nice looking, but no. Like the rest of the bar, they were scratched up messes in disrepair. 

Oh and the celebrity who was the reason for the increased happy hour cost... He was supposed to perform at midnight. At 1a, he was posted up in the VIP section, drinking and feeling up a lady. So not even that could go right! 

The only saving grace of the night were the staff on the back porch. The bartenders and attendant were the nicest people we dealt with, and for them, I am thankful.

"I ignored Vamos Food Truck every time I stopped by In the Loop because if there is one thing I thought I knew about arepas, they aren't vegan. Turns out, I was wrong.

Vamos has a couple of vegan items on their menu. They have loaded fries that can be made vegan, a vegan arepa and yucca fries.

I ordered an arepa and the fried yucca. The arepa comes topped with ratatouille vegetables (eggplant,  squash, zucchini and tomato), pico de gallo, guacamole and chimichurri sauce. All of this is loaded onto a handmade, white corn, arepa. The filling was incredible. Five star worthy in my mind. I found the arepa to be a bit too salty. Tone down the salt a bit, and Vamos becomes a five star joint.

The fried yucca was on point. Expertly fried, not too greasy. It was crisp on the outside and soft and melty inside. I loved dipping them in the chimichurri.

"Arepitas is a cute little Venezuelan/Lebanese Cafe located near the USF area. My Yelp brother from another mother, Jason C and my friend Dorene M, decided on this restaurant prior to a Yelp event at Busch Gardens.

The staff was friendly here and there were three people working but only one behind the counter. Jeremiah was very friendly and took time to explain all my food options, but I felt awful because a line was starting to form and he was the only one behind the counter.

You can choose to have your meal served in an arepa or a pita. I found this concept to be fascinating  since I had never seen Venezuelan and Lebanese cuisine paired together. 

I wanted something different so I settled on the Venezuelan Arepa with black beans, pulled beef, and white cheese. I had the fried plantains served on the side and not in the arepa. I get creeped out by mixing sweet and salty.  The food was delicious and was definitely a bigger portion than I had imagined. The arepa (as you can see in the picture) was stuffed full.

"We get dinner from Kwan Ming at least once a week; it's THE place to go for Chinese take out. The dishes are authentic and very delicious. Many of the sauces and soups start with homemade chicken stock that give a real depth of flavor. They also make their own duck sauce, chile oil and Chinese mustard.
 Some of my family's favorite starters are the Kwan Ming Shrimp Egg Roll and the Sliced Roast Pork Hong Kong Style. The House Special fried rice was the first dish we ever tried; we were hooked from the start. But where they really excell is the sauces. The Kwan Ming House Special, the Kwan Ming Double Squashes w.Mushroom (I like to add pork with it), and the Pork with Garlic   Sauce exemplify the flavorful sauces that meld soy (which the owner blends himself),  ginger, garlic and the homemade stock without being cloying and thick. The General Tso's Chicken has a beautifully fresh flavor that my wife loves. She also adds extra zing to it with the homemade Chinese mustard. The Lobster with Ginger special they have offered recently is subtle and sublime, showing the care and expertise of the chef. 
 It's always best to order ahead, but you will miss out on the huge variety of fish offerings that need to be added to the online menu.

"Yelpers rejoice: a father and son are running a hole-in-the-wall that takes something familiar (pizza) with an unfamiliar twist. We eat this stuff up. Literally.

Detroit-style pizza may be new to Tampa, so I'll break it down like a cheap import: you start with the crust on the bottom, of course, but after that everything's reversed. Toppings go directly onto the crust, followed by so much cheese that it flows out to the edge of the pan and dies a delicious crispy death. Tomato sauce goes on top.

We went for the $12 dinner deal: a 1-topping large pizza, which feeds 3-4 people who aren't pizza hogs like I am, with an order of garlic breadsticks and a 2-liter bottle of soda. The guy behind the counter (the son in the father-and-son team) heard us talking about how I drink diet cola and she drinks Mountain Dew, and offered to split it into two cans. Absurd unless you're us; it was actually more valuable split up like that. Smart business move.

The breadsticks, even topped with cheese for an extra 50 cents, weren't particularly Detroity; they give Pokey Stix a run for their money, though. The pizza, which we also split up (half pepperoni, half mushroom -- and yeah, they only count that as one topping, not two), was distinctly better than most pizza I've eaten in Tampa. (Atlantans will recognize it as similar to Jagger's.) 

Again with the thoughtful: the one-man band running Pizza Squared separated the toppings so neatly that I didn't eat a shred of pepperoni, and defied Detroit tradition to put the mushrooms on top so I'd know which side was mine. Very helpful, and btw not completely unfortunate looking either, if anyone wants to play Who Wants To Marry a Cute Pizzeria Operator Who Also Plays in a Band That Sometimes Rehearses in the Aforementioned Pizzeria. (If you're taken, sir, or not marriage-minded, my apologies. I try to mention ALL the charms of a business.)

You'll drive past Pizza Squared the first time because it's in a little strip mall south of Fowler, across from the Yuengling bottling plant, and you'll be paying attention to the traffic cones (probably a good choice). That's okay. Turn around and come back. Next time you won't drive past it without stopping.",21,B,Pizza Squared,Pizza Squared,Pizz@ Squ@red,5.0

"First impression so far is.... Not great. 
Cute place,food smells good. Let's see what it tastes like and how service ends up-

^^^^^^^^
That was my tip. 

This is what ensued:
Came in, went to order. Flaky register attendant, seemed like we were a second priority and were a a bit of a bother. Registers went down (it was raining out...I think it was related) and it took a billion years for the stroke of genius that an order could still be placed by writing it on a piece of paper. 

The Line Up:
Lettuce Wraps
Equivalent to General Tso
Spicy Chicken 

Because we couldn't  pay with the registers down, a manager came and gave us drink cups (we were supposed to take out) and we went and sat down to wait. With that, we decided to eat in. 

The verdict:

Good food! All delicious. 

The service: QUESTIONABLE AT BEST. The cooks seemed to be with it, one manager (jason or Joe, I can't recall) were good. Everybody else? It seems like they are being incovenienced to do any job. I had to get pretty terse with the staff and additional manager to actually pay for our meal. In all of the craziness, we could have easily walked out and not paid for a thing. I believe in karma and juju, so I wanted to be honest. That's pretty much what I had to say to 3 people standing behind the register (another manager included). They all looked confused about me not having paid, needing to pay, wanting to pay, and for someone to actually take care of that.

Got my sandwich and fries. No ketchup or salt, or napkins available anywhere in the entire place, you have to ask for it at the counter.

Opened my sandwich and did a double take... the menu picture of this sandwich shows a meat patty that is a lovely golden brown, and bigger than the bun... this patty looked burnt and was about half the size of the bun.

The wait staff is always kind and always giving recommendations. On my latest trip I had the Lasagna Soup and Buffalo Chicken Pizza. Both had excellent taste, came out in a nice amount of time and were eaten in a quicker amount of time. 

I can honestly say this is one of my favorite spots to get pizza, the entire slice is delicious including the crust, which is not always the case with other pizzas.

I am giving this pizzeria 4 stars based on some of the other selections such as soups and appetizers being good just not as well done as the pizzas. A great spot being so close to Curtis Hixon Park as well as the museums, library, Tampa Theater and the Straz Center.",9,A,Tampa Pizza Company,Tampa Pizza Company,Tampa Pizza Company,4.0
"South Tampa's loss is certainly Carrollwood's gain, as this long-time popular bistro along Azeele Street moved up north to set down some roots at the intersection of N. Dale Mabry Highway and South Village Drive. Circles Bistro now sits in the Carrollwood Village Shops shopping center along with Chili's, World of Beer, Anthony's Coal-Fired Pizza, and Ocean Blue Sushi. Circles is on the very west end of this shopping plaza, facing South Village Drive.

Some of you might remember that Circles was a well-known Carrollwood bistro with a disastrous parking problem, and that's why they pulled up stakes and moved to South Tampa. Now some 13 years later, the Prodigal Son has returned to Carrollwood in a shopping center with lots of available parking spaces.

I was there for Sunday Brunch with my adorable girlfriend, and we were midway through a furniture assembly project of epic proportions when she suggested that we should find something to eat. A quick scan of my trusty Yelp app, and we found ourselves at Circles Bistro which was near to our neighborhood Lowe's.

The outside of Circles Bistro disguises the serene atmosphere inside, and that has always been one of Circles hidden charms. This is a place where you can walk inside and say hi to Michael and Judy. Judy is the chef, while Michael works the front of the house and tends to the bar. There are only about 12 - 15 tables in the restaurant, and about 15 barstools surrounding the bar. The tables all face out to the enclosed courtyard. There is no Wi-Fi service inside the restaurant, and they recommend that their patrons converse with each other, or read through the Sunday paper.

I started my meal with a spicy Bloody Mary, and Brittany ordered a mimosa. After perusing the various breakfast & brunch options I selected a seafood omelet made with sautéed shrimp, scallops, lump crabmeat, and lobster meat with sweet onions and melted Monterey Jack cheese. Britt ordered the goat cheese, spinach & tomatoes omelet. Both omelets came with a choice of home fried potatoes or a fresh fruit medley, and we both opted for the fruit.

While Michael was mixing our drinks, Judy came out of the kitchen to deliver the homemade multi-grain bread with a strawberry compound butter. Oh yum!!!! The omelets arrived shortly thereafter, and they were delicious. In my case lots of very good seafood, covered with melted cheese inside of a fluffy omelet. The fresh fruit medley had a nice mix of apples, strawberries, blueberries, melon, and grapes. Very delicious meal for $12 a piece, plus the drinks.

The brunch menu at Circles has lots of traditional egg dishes and some lighter entrées. Even though seating is limited you are encouraged to relax and enjoy your meal without being made to feel rushed.

The traditional lunch and dinner menu lists a wider variety of casual multi-cultural dining options including Italian, Asian, Cajun, Indonesian, and classic Americana meals. Prices for these meals are closer to $20, and that includes soup or salad. Rumor has it that their lobster bisque is legendary, so I'll go back soon to give that a try.

Circles has a full bar and a rather-large wine cellar, but precious little storage space for the cases of wine as they arrive. Expect to see the boxes lined up in the hallway as you walk back to their dining room.

Bottom line -- a nice place for a quiet Sunday brunch where you can relax and enjoy your food and drink.",37,C,Circles Bistro,Circles Bistro,Circles Bistro,4.0

"After a long night of SoHo bar hopping, this place was a perfect stop! I had the bourbon mango pork kota, which was just delicious, and the perfect amount of food for just $4.50.

I also can't wait to try the grilled cheese... I've yet to encounter a food truck that doesn't make an amazing one, so this is next on my list. This place is going to end up making a mint on Friday and Saturday nights because the food is excellent and is even better when people are desperately foraging after lots and lots of booze.

"Great place to have a casual meal, especially when the weather is nice. 

Amuni is now Uncle Giuseppe.   They have a deli and premade foods in addition to the pizza. They also have some seating, both inside and outside. You order at the at the deli counter or the cashier (for pizza), then they bring you the food when it is ready.

They do not sell alcohol, but there is a wine bar next door where you can buy a bottle to drink at Amuni. Or you can bring your own bottle. Note: Amuni has a corkscrew but no wine glasses. If you dont want to drink out of plastic cups, you need to buy wine from the wine bar. 

The pizza is excellent. I highly recommend pizzas with Stracciatella instead of mozzarella, although both are good. The Stracciatella is so mild and creamy.

"A day at the State Fairgrounds in Tampa left us hungry for something not-so heavy, so we headed over to Loving Hut.

The facade of this place does not make you pull sharply off the road to eat; the inside had a combination of student restaurant and weird cult vibes, the weird cult vibes generated by the free literature and continuously running video of grand master whatever.

Service was friendly, earnest, but distracted. Again, it all makes sense here.

We split a Spring Roll appetizer. This was the low point of the meal. While the filling was tasty and fresh, something bad had happened when the wrappers were deep fried leaving them both greasy (sort of ok) and tasting like grease (bad). Perhaps they were re-fried or the oil needs to be changed?

For entrees we had the Pad Thai and a Burger with Passionate Fries. (The burger does not come with fries; we ordered them separately.)

The Pad Thai was a good vegan rendition, somewhat oversalted, but that seems to be a trend here. We are not vegan, and missed the egg.

The burger was very good; a patty made from a 'secret recipe' with sauteed mushrooms and sauteed onions, tomato and greens. The bun was toasted.

The passionate fries (where do they get the names on this menu?) were crinkle-cut fries with a totally addictive spicy sauce. The fries did not suffer the same fate in the fryer as the spring rolls, leading me to believe that the rolls were badly re-fried or sat under a lamp or something.

Oh, and its pretty cheap.

We'd go back.",33,C,Loving Hut,Loving Hut,Loving Hut,3.0

"A true vintage gem, recently restored and re-opened in downtown Tampa.  Clearly loads of money, applied with good taste and attention to detail.   IN my opinion, this is the classiest bar in town, in the classiest hotel.  Drinks are served with assured professionalism and warm conversation.   Drink specials include a ""Between the Sheets"" cocktail from pre-Prohibition days to help soldiers and sailors get lucky with elegance. The  old wood bar and furnishings suggest opulence without pretense.   Drink prices are a bit higher than most hotel bars or the nearby Hub, but the quality is immeasurably superior.   Clearly this is not a place to hang out in cut-offs, t-shirts and flip-flops, but we were treated with attentive respect in business casual...not requiring coat and tie and evening gowns

"Loved this ""Deutsch"" place!  It has only 4.5 booths and decorated in bright red.  Loved that the plates were ceramic, not paper or styro.  The full dinners run about $10, I was lightly hungry so got the pork schnitzel burger for $5.  They brought 3 slices of a good German bread out to nibble on. It was delish.  It was a great sandwich but they over did the catsup and mustard for my taste and I'll order on the side next time.  They overenthusiastically removed my plate when they saw the sandwich gone and I'd have liked to have finished the little salad and bits that fell out of the sandwich.  I took some red cabbage to go and can't wait to try it.  I wish the desserts were on display  (none on chalkboard and none visible in case) or that I saw the breads or pretzels.  I'd have bought some. So they might do a better job of advertising and displaying their wares for better sales (or maybe Fridays they don't have them?).  I did witness them take a large order for take-out and then get a call in and change the order so they were a little frenzied for 2 employees.

"I genuinely like Salad Station for its freshness, but I can't give it 5 stars due to the ""price by the pound"" concept. As others have said, this does get really expensive for a salad.

I absolutely love salads. We frequented Jason's Deli in Clearwater Countryside when we lived close because a clean salad bar with tons of options are so appealing! However at salad station you don't get as many options, but you pay a lot more!

It's over $8 per pound for a salad and the hot bar is over $6 a pound. A decent salad with drink can easily set you back $16 or more...1 salad!

That being said, I've used coupons and paid full price and have thoroughly enjoyed my meals here. 

The restaurant is super clean...huge plus for a germaphobe. The workers and owner/operator are very friendly. The salad and toppings are fresh and the area around it is kept very clean from customer spills. There are so many salad dressing options! You can try before putting them on your salad with little cups too. The poppyseed dressing is a must try! 

I've only had the baked sweet potato at the hot bar. I have to say they really hand pick those potatoes. I didn't need any butter or toppings on that sweet potato! It was naturally sweet! They are a good size too...which means you're definitely paying over $6 for a potato...yikes!

It's worth coming back when I get a coupon in the mail. The coupons basically give you 1 pound of salad for free. With drinks being around $3 (they have really good juice/tea options too that are hard to resist) you're still going to end up paying at least $5 as it's easy to go over 1 pound!

"I have been to Golden China before and it hasn't been bad, but this time the food was not so good. I went really late and ordered chicken with broccoli.  The broccoli was fresh, but the chicken had a weird texture to it. My wife didn't eat her dinner and I ended up eating mine, which ended up upsetting my stomach. The chicken didn't taste like chicken, almost like a pork. The service was really good, but I am not sure what happened to the chicken. It didn't taste like it. At first I thought that it wasn't cooked all the way, so I cooked it some more, but it was still the same gummy texture. Not coming back.",12,A,Golden China,Golden China,golden china,2.0

"The tortilla soup was fantastic, and worthy of an extra star just on its own.   
The conch meat and spaghetti entrees were both disappointing.  Be forewarned that it is not a good restaurant if there are vegetarians in your party. 
But most disappointing was that we did not get what was promised on the menu.  The conch meat arrived without the salad, and the tortilla soup arrived without the cream cheese and avocado slices.  Puzzled, I asked about the avocado, and was brought one...only to be charged extra for it on the bill.  Since the server was not fluent in English and I do not speak Spanish, communicating about the discrepancies was difficult.  I decided not to bother trying to straighten out the bill.
Finally, service was extremely slow, which was pretty surprising since we were the only diners in the restaurant.  Not a place we'll return to, even for the tortilla soup.",15,B,Los Jarrones,Los Jarrones,Los Jarrones Inc.,2.0
"The food is very good and reasonably priced. The front staff is friendly and efficient. The 3 rating is based on interactions with the manager/owner. My co-workers and I  have lunch there at least 3x a week. Our orders which include some substitutions due to dietary restrictions were suggested by the staff and are always the same. On a recent visit we ordered our standard meals, the manager refused to make the substitutions pointing out the menu and ultimately got our order completely wrong. She was argumentative and did not apologize for the confusion. We are definitely not difficult customers, we order the exact same thing every time, we don't send food back even on the rare occasion it was wrong and we always tip. So I don't think our request to substitute steamed rice with rice noodles was unreasonable.

"Jason's Deli is solidly okay.  On one hand, not a ringing endorsement but on the other, the few menu items I really like are predictably good and reliable.  And who doesn't love having a soft serve cone while waiting for your food?

I like a few of their soups, but wish there was more variety rather than same ones over and over.  I enjoy their version of a muffaletta and like the option to use turkey rather than salami.  I also like the Meatballa - good meatballs in a flavorful sauce with a nice blanket of melted cheese on top.  They are a little too eager to slap avocado on things, which is why I don't order most of the rest of the menu.

"I guess it's time to give up the goods on a great little ""hole-in-the-wall"" Mexican restaurant located on Hillsborough Avenue. First of all there's the trick of finding this place.... Start by going east on Hillsborough under the Vets, and keep an eye on the right. Just past the fence for Tampa International Airport is a small yellow building near a U-Haul store. If you make it to U-Haul then you've gone too far......keep driving, as that means more chips for me. Yayyyyyy!!!!

Guadalajara's is not the typical Mexican chain restaurant, and not the kind of place to go if you're looking to use some kind of internet coupon promising plates of crappy tacos for $5. Guadalajara's *IS* made-to-order, very fresh, very fairly priced, and delicious. 

My personal favorite is the carnitas plate with a bowl of their outstanding charro beans.

The staff speaks Spanish (Wow, big surprise....), and the clientele is generally Hispanic (Another shock, I know....), but they are extremely gracious, helpful, and I can promise you a relaxed meal that you'll enjoy.

And if you don't like it......keep driving, and look for a Taco Bell.  Ole'",4,A,Guadalajara Mexican Restaurant,Guadalajara Mexican Restaurant,guadalajara mexican restaurant,4.0

After posting a review of a less than great experience, I was contacted by the GM. She actually took the time to read my review and contacted me personally to let me know that they took my feedback seriously and made some changes to ensure a consistently good experience. 
So we gave them another shot today. The food was really good. Everything was cooked as ordered and looked as good as it tasted. The service was excellent as usual and I met the GM during our visit.

The gal taking orders was short and rude, doing the very least necessary to technically fulfil job requirements. She gave me a Frostee with no spoon, and the wrong salad dressing. Lemon Garlic Caesar dressing on a Cobb salad is yuck.

The menu was massive, but we settled on breakfast which narrowed it to about a third of the menu. I got the western omelette with hash browns and wheat toast and my friend got the gyro omelette (did I forget to mention that this place is an odd fusion of cafe and Greek food?) and hash browns with no toast.

Our food was good! Kind of straight up greasy diner food. Not the best omelette I've ever eaten but satisfying nonetheless. The wheat toast was surprisingly good! Our server was attentive and quick as well.

"This is my third time ordering from this establishment. Here are my reviews from my three visits:
First visit was an online pickup order -  even though I ordered online, I still had to wait an additional 20 minutes after my ""pickup time"". This was really annoying & they even kept confusing me with other pickup orders. In the end, we tried the breakfast churro bites & frozen horchata. When we got home, the churro bites were soggy from the whip cream but we're still extremely delicious. The frozen horchata was delicious. 
Second visit - we did an Uber eats order and got the chicken pad Thai. As an avid Thai food eater, I was not a huge fan. 
Third visit - we ordered through doordash. This time we ordered popcorn chicken and fries, a cookies and cream smoothie, the churro bites (again) and stir fry chicken noodles. Not sure if the day we ordered the pad thai, they were having an off day, because today's order was delicious. This time, they put the whip cream on the side (genius) so the churros were fresh. The stir fry had great taste and the popcorn chicken was very crunchy and came with a sweet and sour sauce. 
I would definitely give this place another try, and I'm addicted to their breakfast churro bites so I guess I'll have no choice but to go back. I might give the pad Thai another try.",12,A,Hiccups & Churroholic,Hiccups & Churroholic,Hiccups & Churroholic,4.0

"This place is a step above most Asian buffets.  I enjoy most Asian buffets not because they are actually any good, but because I like a good deal and that is what Asian buffets give you, a lot of food for a really good price.  However, Crazy Buffet is different.  I actually like it for the food.  

I was there for dinner and it has a great selection of sushi.  The salmon sashimi was very good when it was actually there.  I felt like a shark circling my prey the amount of times I went over there to check to see if the sashimi was restocked yet.  The only sushi I didn't like was the tempura.  The deep fried sushi was kind of cold, which took away from the flavor.  

It is definitely more expensive than most Asian Buffet places at dinner.  However, when you want to treat yourself to sushi, this is the place to do it.  Do not be too critical of the restaurant.  The booth we sat at had tears in them.  Judge this place for the food, not the surroundings.",1,A,Crazy Buffet,Crazy Buffet,Crazy Buff3t,4.0

"Impressed with this place. Food here is fresh and tasty with good variety whether one is watching their weight, indulging a little, or is just trying to eat healthy.The first item I got was the asiago roast beef sandwich (half) side garden salad. The bread was very soft on the inside, toasted on the outside. Meat was hot and tender and was complimented by the sauce it came with and the shredded asiago cheese.  On this second trip I've had the garden salad with lumps of crab meat in it. I had a cup of the kickin crab chowder, which was delicious and was hot upon its arrival. My boyfriend had the french dip with french onion soup, which he liked. My garden salad had a good variety of vegetables in it with shredded cheese. Definitely will be back to this location.

Huge thanks to Yelper, Sarah B, for her review that put Yakitodo on my radar. It's not too far from my house, but I don't often drive down this section of Waters, so I probably never would have discovered it otherwise. It's kind of hidden towards the back of the Comfort Inn parking lot, so even when I had my GPS on, I didn't even see it until I was in the actual lot.

As for the food - one bite in and I knew it was going to be an amazing meal. I ordered the steak teriyaki rice bowl and was smitten. I also ordered some pork bao buns and thought they were great, too. I was actually not super hungry at the time of ordering this, but I gobbled up every last bite and would happily return again. I'd definitely like to try the tacos... and honestly, everything else on the menu :)",38,C,Yakitodo,Yakitodo,Y@kitodo,5.0

"Sunova Beach is a cool concept - I like the beach bar vibe and the retro drink selection. We went on a Tuesday which isn't particularly busy in SoHo - but its the College Night at Sunova Beach. 

They do $2 Long Island Iced Teas, which is alright - but what I really liked about Sunova Beach was their fish bowls which seemed like a better choice. They are $15 but certainly can be split with friends to enjoy and had a good amount of alcohol and mixers. Our favorite was the Jaws which has vodka, DonQ Coco, Blue Curacao, Pineapple Juice, Sprite, and club soda in it.

Staff was friendly and quick to make drinks, check on us, and later close the tab. Overall, had a good first impression and will be back to check out again in the future.",19,B,Sunova Beach,Sunova Beach,Sun0va Beach,4.0

I always get their lobster roll and onion rings when I go here, and I have never been disappointed. It's not what you might expect from a lobster roll, with huge chunks of lobster all around. This lobster is finely finely chopped, giving a consistent and easy to consume texture. I prefer this kind of lobster roll, but many people love the huge chunks of lobster meat.

Ordered from here two meals - a lobster ravioli and a lasagna ... It was meant for a 12 year old because I'm still hungry. It was all sauce and no lasagna the lobster must have jumped out of it because it was a cheese ravioli rather than a lobster one. The non lobster ravioli was burnt on the bottom and the sauce on it looked like it had sat there for a while. The cake for 299 was small the bread sticks were horrible and hard.

"Yes, Yoko's is good, but if you want to experience the most amazing combinations of fresh ingredients, than I highly recommend this discreet little joint. Lee, the owner is the 'man' behind the Bar. He has a memory like an elephant, and after you become a regular, you barely have to tell him what you want to eat, because he has that special gift to satisfy your exact appetite, on that exact occasion. He always gets it right. In addition, Lee is Korean and there are certain dishes and/or or sauces that he is able to fuse with the traditional dishes. 

His tuna tataki, is the best I have ever had. The sauce has an orange tint to it, with a pleasant kick, that will have you taking your straw to the plate to get all of the sauce. 

Fuji, has all the traditional things, and does the basics as good as anyone. The prices are reasonable, and you get what you pay for. 

Recommendations:  Bucs Roll, Volcano Roll, Spicy Crunchy Tuna... basically anything with the word 'spicy' there is great. Lee is a master chef, and deserves much more than this meager review I can write. Try this place, and if I'm wrong, please comment.",3,A,Fuji Sushi,Fuji Sushi,Fuji Sushi,5.0

"Lee Roy Selmon's is known as a place for great Southern soul food where you can enjoy a frosty adult beverage while watching your favorite sporting event, and terrific table-side service.

I was thrilled to see that Lee Roy Selmon's had opened a location in Carrollwood, as I was a frequent guest of the original spot on Boy Scout Road across from International Plaza. The Carrollwood location is on N. Dale Mabry Highway, south of Ehrlich Road, and next door to Sweet Tomatoes. I had to chuckle when I discovered that Lee Roy Selmon's had taken over the space previously occupied by The Tilted Kilt, and I was trying to envision everyone's last day of work at The Tilted Kilt. (""OK ladies, turn in your naughty schoolgirl uniforms and pick up your football jerseys and jeans."")

Thankfully Selmon's cleaned up the place, and brought in a crew of highly-qualified, and very friendly servers. The restaurant boasts dozens and dozens of flat-screen TVs easily viewed from every angle, as well as photos and other sports mementos from Lee Roy Selmon's Hall of Fame career with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

The bar area contains an open wall to the outside with seating both indoors and outdoors, while the main restaurant has a good selection of booths and tables to fit any sized group.

The menu is a mix of Southern classics including fried chicken, pulled pork, ribs, brisket, meatloaf, steaks, burgers, nachos, wings, and other bar food.

Nicely decorated with non-obtrusive Med music.

We received good service with accurate descriptions of menu items.  Prices, even before a coupon were reasonable, and parking in a strip mall on Fletcher was easy.

We ordered sushi ..weird feeling inserted.. but turned out decent. The rolls  came out quick and were small in comparison to sushi only places. The dinner for two was pretty good and there were at least 6 types of banchan that came with the dinner . So you get a grilled  fish, spicey  tofu soup , fried veggie pancake , a noodles with beef dish and the Korean BBQ is half bulgogi and galbi. Overall the meal was satisfying and we left full.

"The Hospitality and Restaurant Management School of Hillsborough Community College operates a 'Gourmet Room' and opens the doors to the general public a few days each week. The Gourmet Room provides hands-on experience in a real working restaurant environment for the students. They learn culinary management and customer service skills by preparing all meals, serving guests, and handling management duties. 

The menu changes frequently, so that you'll never experience the same style of cuisine each time that you visit. Check the www.hccfl.edu/GourmetRoom for the latest dates, times, menus, and the ability to make your reservations.

The meals are $7 a piece which includes iced tea. Since the restaurant does not have a liquor license, your only other option is coffee which is available for an extra charge. Unless you are a total penny pincher, you'll throw down a total of $10 since the extra $3 goes towards the Student Scholarship Funds, and that seems only fair for the quality of the food.

On the night that I visited, a group of Yelpers led by Boon and Grace, descended on the Gourmet Room for Moroccan night. We shared a long table and a lot of laughs as well enjoyed the three-course meal.

Moroccan cuisine is influenced by the interactions and exchanges with other regional cultures and nations over the centuries. It is typically a mixture of Mediterranean, Arabic, Andalusian, and Berber cuisines. A typical meal begins with a series of hot and cold salads, followed by a tagine (dome-shaped, traditional earthenware cooking pot) filled with lamb or chicken, and served over couscous.

Our three-course meal started with a sampler of lentil soup; a salad of watermelon, feggous (Armenian cucumbers), feta cheese, and red onion slices, with fresh herbs; and a pita wedge. After some chuckles with Nick about the ""sweet tomatoes"" in the salad, we set to work polishing off our little appetizer trays.

Next was the main course, and this was a chicken tagine made with sliced chicken breasts, garlic, onion, turmeric, vegetables, tomatoes, and lemons, which are all cooked in these earthenware pots, and then served over a bed of couscous.

Our dessert was a piece of milk bastilla, which can best be described as thin sheets of a phyllo-like pastry dough with a milky cream put between the sheets of dough, before the whole thing is baked. The result is a sweet dessert, not unlike a baklava.

As Boon had prepped us, we were in and out in an hour, as the students had to clear the tables and wash the dishes before they were allowed home for the evening. We did manage to sneak in a tour of the working kitchen, and had the chance to visit with the head chef / culinary instructor before leaving.

It was a most enjoyable evening, and I look forward to going back and trying a different cuisine.",26,B,Gourmet Room at HCC,Gourmet Room at HCC,G0urmet R00m at HCC,4.0

"I love Felicitous. It is truly an independent coffee house and they try to use local products, which is always nice. This little house in inconspicuously located on a side street just off Fowler. The staff is very friendly and I can promise you it is a very cozy shop. They use vintage reclaimed furniture to decorate the interior. Often the walls will be covered in local art that is for sale. The place is usually busy with USF students, especially around midterms and finals. They usually have a calendar of events ranging from poetry readings to open mic nights and much more. I used to be part of a book club that met there years ago till I had to move away. They also have board games available to patrons. This place will always hold a place in my heart.

I know they have opened a second location nearby this original location which is a bit more modern and can probably hold more people. I am happy that they are doing so great! This place is a hidden gem amongst the chaos on Fowler.

They have lots of snacks and make awesome sandwiches. My favorite used to be a PB&J with honey and granola or bananas, I can't remember but it was good. They can generally make you any panini you want as long as they have the ingredients. Their Taro frappe was delicious too. The prices were fair for what they offer.

I highly recommend checking this place out. You will not regret it. I often think about Felicitous and the awesome people I met there, I wish I still lived close by. If you are tired of starbucks, dunkin, etc. give this place a try, even if you are not!",15,B,Felicitous,Felicitous,F3licitous,5.0

The fried pickles were light and tart, perfectly fried really good sauce on the side. Then the burger. Oh the burger. It was perfectly seasoned. Spicy and flavorful. I like my burgers well done, which sometimes make them taste like hockey pucks, but this was so juicy and moist. And all of the toppings were fresh. The lettuce was crispy, the tomato was juicy, and the onions were fresh. A super soft bun accompanied by the most perfectly cooked fries I've ever eaten.

"This place is my go to Korean restaurant in Tampa.  I have tried several but I think this one is the best.  I always come here with other people who have lived in Korea and we totally love it when we find very authentic food. This restaurant is both authentic and even looks like a place I used to spend time in while living in Korea so it brings back memories as well.  It is not fancy but it is Korean and that adds to the charm.

If you are going to have an appetizer I recommend...
Ddeokboki  - rice cakes in a spicy red sauce - AMAZING!
Kimchi Jeon  - kimchi pancake 
Mandu  - fried pork dumplings

To be honest, I prefer my mandu to be steamed and not fried.  I wish they would offer the mandu steamed.  :(

My favorite Entrees are...
Dolsot Bibimbap  - the hot version of Bibimbap served in a hot stone pot
Jjam Bbong Soup  - spicy seafood soup with noodles
Bibimbap  - beef, rice, egg and mixed veggies served COLD with hot sauce
Kimchi Jigae  - Kimchi stew with pork

I want you to know if you order the ddeokboki as an appetizer you probably will not be able to eat the rest of your food.  It is a lot of food and very filling, but it just the best.

"The new BDubs in Ybor is amazing!!! I've been to a few different Buffalo Wild Wings not in Florida and I've only ever had their wings because their wings are delicious! Lots of creative flavors! Personal favs include: mango habanero (very hot! not for the faint of heart), Asian zing, Caribbean jerk, and honey bbq (though obviously, you can probably tell that I like the tangy/sweet flavor in my wings). I love spicy food and I will say that around hot/mango habanero is my threshold. Hot is bearable... mango habanero is REALLY tasty and one of my favorites but it's so hot that it's painful as I am eating it... but so good that I can't force myself to stop. Past that, I have tried the wild and blazin' flavors and they are SUPER painful. Can't eat more than 1 wing at a time, and when I do, my mouth burns for awhile after and everything that I eat afterwards tastes extremely spicy. 

The BDubs in Ybor has tons of huge TVs everywhere -- great for watching sports! Also, good service... I couldn't decide which flavor I wanted (you can split your order, but you have to get a minimum of 5 wings of each flavor), so she brought out a bunch of different sauces for me to sample! Also, if you ask your server, they can give you a little machine where you can play trivia or poker with other people in the restaurant off of a TV screen.

"My friends and I went a few weeks ago on a slow week night shortly after the big opening.
If you go, be prepared to eat..aLOT.
Each of us foolishly ordered our own and ended up with enough food to feed 8!
Let me give you the run down:
All food is prepared after you order it. This means that there is no giant vat of pre-made macaroni and cheese that is simply tossed with whatever flavor/toppings you select (the preferred method of a few of the places I tried in Los Angeles). The pasta is cooked and tossed in sauce after you order it-- that means you need to be patient and wait a few minutes. I could see this being problematic at a busy lunch hour.
The pasta is also not baked (being made to order), meaning if you are looking for a crackly cheesy crust, this is not your spot. However, it's still ooey gooey delicious so don't be scared.
Between the four of us, we were able to try four different flavors. Be brave! My trusted broccoli cheese pick was actually my least favorite-- bolder flavors were found in the taco or the Italian! I couldn't stop stealing bites from my friends.
We also sampled a few of the wings- baked and not too spicy (aka perfect combo).

"In the past, I'd give hotel restaurants a bad rap. But that was then and this is now. Located in the Hyatt Place hotel in downtown Tampa, is Corazon restaurant- the definition of a relaxed vibe with a sophisticated soul. 

After a hectic and early Friday wedding ceremony, food was excellent when we had the chance to sit down and catch our breath a bit. Think Latin-themed menu filled with seafood, some plantains, green salad with Avocado, etc (with non-Latin foods as well). The bar is large, there's enough seating available and the style is banging too. 

Our server was wonderful, upbeat and boy... did my girl know the menu left and right because she didn't even write anything down. So much so, there was a curveball where my sister in law asked our server if the kitchen can whip up a plain personal pizza for her 12 yr old grandson and it was a ""yes"".

They probably have about 10-12 booths and tables inside, with a few outside. It's bright and colorful with a nautical theme. And it's all about the Mexican food and seafood! Rock on! It's so refreshing to not have just another Tex-Mex joint!

We were immediately brought individual servings of Tuna Ceviche with crackers and corn tortillas. Yummmm! Our night was perfect from this alone! Great flavor, just enough lime, and served with tomatoes and cucumber. It was amazing!

We also had the Queso appetizer. Great size for $4.50 and i appreciates that it was a thick queso, not something runny.

My daughter had the kids quesadilla and enjoyed. Stuffed full with cheese. I had the Carne Asada. Huge portion, and while the meat was cooked well, i found it to be a bit bland and in need of seasoning. The veggies with it were well cooked. And the refried beans are amazing! Ever so slightly chunky, they're a real treat.

We ended with Flan. Wasn't as impressed here. The caramel flavor was smooth, and the custard yummy, but it was over cooked and had a tough layer on the bottom.

Will i go back, yes. Enough of our meal was great that i would. I was intrigued and many of the dishes going by looked and smelled amazing. Next time I'm going to try their pineapple dish. And maybe more ceviche!",31,C,El Pescador,El Pescador,El Pesc@dor,4.0

And cheese. Delicious rosemary and goat cheese with toasted bread, and some other kind of amazing cheese that you can get at Casa Jimez. 

And these delicious meats. I don't even know what it was called but I hated sharing them. 

So, I came to Casa Jimez for my second girls night out tonight.

It's a cute little family owned place and they have a back room area for hosting events. You can order a platter of the meats and cheeses and drink the bottle of wine you bought. Certain wines you can BOGO which makes it even more affordable.

Then to top it off I sat for ten minutes waiting for another beer while she was on her phone. When I tabbed out she didn't say two words, never a thank you, how is everything, just stone faced. I would have had another beer but I didn't feel like waiting ten minutes and the place was empty so I went over to the pour house and got a cold beer there in seconds of entering.",24,B,Maloney's Local Irish Pub,Maloney's Local Irish Pub,Malon3y's Local Irish Pub,2.0
"I've been waiting for this for months and truly wanted to love it!  I showed up with friends on a Saturday night around 10pm.  There were only two other patrons in the bar (this was after the Boat Parade).  When asked why it was so dead, the staff nonchalant stated that they'd just opened last month and ""didn't expect to be busy"". I found this a bit odd. We tried three different types of the sangria. Oddly, they all had the same fruit and had little to no flavor. Very watered down tasting. This place needs to definitely up its sangria game for the prices being charged when they are right down from the street from the Columbia Cafe!!",14,B,La La’s Sangria Bar,La La’s Sangria Bar,La La’s Sangria Bar,1.0
"Beautiful views of Tampa Bay and the Tampa / St Petersburg skyline!

This famous connector puts you from St Pete to Tampa or vice versa.  If you're coming from St Pete, this is the direct route to get to Tampa International Airport.  Word of caution: mind commuter traffic if you're trying to catch a flight.  Any accident can slow this route to a crawl, and currently the exit lanes for the airport bottleneck to one lane, making traffic management problematic.

There are places to pull over and take pictures before and after the bridge on both sides.  Storms during the summer look amazing from here, as you can see shelf clouds and supercells in all their majesty.

I don't consider us particular on where we buy our plantains and ropa vieja, but this doesn't even come close to making the cut for us.  We've tried their menu a half dozen times and have given plenty of opportunities for error, but it just isn't good.  To be honest, it was really bad.  The Ropa Vieja was extremely tough, although pretty flavorful.  The baked chicken was flavorless, but moist.  Both the beans tasted okay, but the yellow rice was not cooked well at all.  I ordered green beans as a side, and they looked like canned, but tasted worse.  
The restaurant itself, is usually empty with one or both of the doors open.  This is not a welcome sign for a dining establishment.

"I was visiting Tampa this weekend with some friends and we decided to try Streetcar Charlie's.

The menu left something to be desired.  There were salads, burgers and sandwiches as well as some higher priced entrees but everyone in my group of 5 had trouble finding something that sounded good.  We decided to go on the lighter side ordering some appetizers, a cuban sandwich and chicken salad.  None of the meals were anything special.  The cuban sandwich was heavy on the mayo, light on the meat and cheese.  The salad was ordinary and the appetizers came out cold.  Unfortunately, we later discovered that the appetizers were probably undercooked because later that evening, those that ate the crab cakes came down with a nasty case of food poisoning.  Not exactly a great way to make a good impression for a dining establishment.

"My first time ordering here was yesterday.  I went in for takeout, ordered 02 oxtails and side of plantains. The server told me it would be 30-45 min even though only 02 tables were occupied, their party of 8 had them bogged down... really? So I said fine, we'll wait. I placed the order at 7:43pm, ran an errand, returned at 8:25. I thought I'd be grabbing and going a that point but the server said ""sorry, it'll be another 30min. We ran out and had to make another batch. But they'll be fresh!"" (What are they usually?) I thought this whole ordeal was completely unacceptable and requested a refund. The manager came out and asked that I wait because something about not being able to process the refund until after midnight. She said to come in and have drinks and an appetizer on her. I got my wife and 4mo old out the car and inside. The food we ordered came out at 9:20 and we packed it to go without tasting a bit bc my baby was tired. The story isn't over yet... fast forward, we get home, get him to bed and proceed to FINALLY eat after 10pm (we live in St Pete). The food was coo, the rice and peas was 90% rice and 10% peas, pretty dry and not much flavor. The plate comes with 2 plantains. I've never heard of such a slim portion on a $24 plate. The oxtails...OH the oxtails...they were good. Really no complaint there and the serving was generous. So generous that mine had a fork full of what appeared to be plastic packaging. Yes, there was a 3in long, 2in wide piece of plastic stewed in my oxtails. I was going to let the extreme delay for receiving our food go without writing a review but the plastic was the needle that broke the.... you know the rest. 

I'm not sure how I feel about this restuarant. The setup is nice and intimate, the manager was nice and polite and the food was above decent. But my first experience was not aligned with most everyone else's.

The food was made perfectly, with the right amount of kick in the curry. The large portion was the right size and filled me up. My wife also got a beef patty and she was happy with how it was made and tasted.

The pork sandwich was very well prepared, the pork was very flavorful.  Only bummer was that there was a lot of fat left on the pork, but hey that's where the flavor comes from.  Still plenty of yummy pork to enjoy.  The sauces they provided were tangy and not too sweet.

"Being a large chain, I must emphasize  that this review is exclusively about this particular location and not a review of Pizza Hut overall.

I agree with the other reviewer that the employees in this location are courteous, but what good does this make when the pizzas are made the wrong way?. I too have suffered of wrong orders, but my main concern with this particular location is that more than one time I've had my pizzas WAY undercooked.

The first time they told me that when you ask for lots of ingredients, the pizza would not be well cooked in the middle. I believed this explanation as it seemed so sound logical, but a couple days ago I ordered  two pizzas: One loaded with ingredients and the other one just regular cheese and pepperoni. Both were WAY WAY undercooked with the dough being almost raw in the middle (pan pizza).

Even though I live a couple blocks from this location, I will have to drive further to the Dale Mabry location for a well cooked one, as nothing has been done about this issue and I've reported it a few times already.

P.S. What is with the 2 inch wings?, I ordered a box with almost 30 wings and it was a TINY LITTLE box!. At first I thought they gave me the wrong order but after counting them they were all there!.

"Rare Ethnic Food #53. Haitian cuisine. 

I was hesitating about come here because the mixed reviews. After visited the restaurant, I found out the reason why. 50% of the food is fried here, it will be not great to have the take out. Eat there is the key. Because when you brought the food home, these food turn tougher. Especially the pork. 

We started out appetizers as Salty Fish Pate. The pastry skin is very flaky and the salty fish is great. Our next appetizer is the Akra. This is malanga fritter with great coating with nice seasoning. Malanga is root veggies. It is interesting to be fried with coating. 

We order the griot. It similar to chicharon in Spanish food. But the pork is seasoning before fried. Better than chicharon. It come with rice and bean and tostone. It also serve with spicy coleslaw and spicy red curry. This dish really need to be eat there. If not, the pork skin will be to tough to bite after you order to go and eat at home. You need to experience the crispy of just fried pork. 

I also got the Tassot Kabrit. It is marinated fried goat. The bone in chop meat is delicious and soft. It was not tough. May be just fry or the chef have good technique.

"This place is unreal: world-class Cuban food, probably the highest quality and best-tasting roast pork in Tampa, and for less than the price of a fast-food Value Meal. 

I've been eating cuban roast pork / puerco asado around the Tampa Bay area for years, from just about every Pipo's, Columbia, La Teresita, the old Tio Pepe's, and all the little sandwich shanties tucked away in industrial districts around town (of which this is one), Brocato's, Havana Village (awful, but that's a whole other story), etc.

I'm talking 15+ years of actively eating and loving this stuff...and for the iconic Cuban roast pork, El Paraiso is IT. 

The roast pork is insane. The ONE restaurant I would recommend to anyone for a Tampa cuban food experience. It's a Tampa must-do. 

With it you'll get yellow rice, black beans, plantains and buttered cuban bread...for under five bucks. I know, right? Insanity, even if it was lousy food. It just so happens to be probably the best in town, though. With a cold Materva, this is just a fantastic and HUGE meal for under six dollars. 

The chicken is great (but the pork is just a little bit more magical) and the papas rellenas (ground spiced meat stuffed mashed potato balls, fried in crumbs) is cheap and fantastic. Honestly, I could get away with one of those and a side, although they are smaller than the monsters at, say, Brocatos.

The thing that makes the papas rellenas here extra fantastic (despite what appears to be somewhat lower quality filling ingredients than Brocato's) is their homemade hot sauce...Brocato's will give you some Texas Pete packet or other shaker bottle of some commercial product, but El Paraiso gives you a little lidded Solo cupp-ette of their amazing pepper sauce. It's hot, but is calmed by the potato. A perfect pairing and the base item tastes just as good if not better.

The cafe mediano / Cafe Con Leche is excellent as well, nutty, rich, sweet as it should be and done really well. Great breakfast cubans as well!

As for the decor, my wife went on my recommendation and after getting back, she started describing it as ""Oh man it was this little sh--"" and in that split second I was sure she was going to finish that sentence with the words ""it"" followed by ""hole""....but no, she went on to say ""shack"" - and that's about what it is.

"In my constant quest for good, authentic Mexican food in Tampa Bay, I'm willing to break out from my regular go to's and try new places because you never know. And it's good to have back ups for your usual haunts. Tried Tacos 4G based on reviews and I found fellow yelpers to be most accurate. I tried the Asada and Carnitas tacos, as well as their chicken tamale. All were authentic, and very tasty when coupled with an ice cold Modelo. Carnitas were spot on, but asada, while tasty, was not as good as it should be. Service was relatively indifferent, and pricing was just a tad too high for what you get. Not over priced per se for Tampa, but not as good as the price they are asking. Tacos 4G won't dethrone Loli's any time soon, but worthy of 4 stars.

The store sells produce, bait, antiques, and miscellaneous basic home products.  They also have a sandwich window with a small, but delicious, selection. Soup, salads, ice cream, and chili are also available.

My first visit, I wandered around, looked at the odd collection of items they had for sale, had a delicious cookie, then wandered out.  

My next visit, I went straight to the sandwich window for an egg salad sandwich on a Kaiser roll. While I was waiting, one of the women working behind the counter asked me if I would like to try their soup of the day - a collard greens, bacon, bean soup - yes, please!  It was so incredibly delicious, I immediately cancelled my order for chili, and changed it to soup.  My egg salad was so flavorful, and huge, but of course, I managed to devour the whole thing.

Also this visit, they had cookies coming out of the oven, and the smell was so amazing I had to get 3 of the peanut butter stuffed peanut butter cookies.  These were some of the best cookies I have ever had - and the people I shared them with thought so, too.

My most recent visit, I tried the chicken salad, and a ""breakfast cookie"" - sugar cookie topped with maple icing and candied bacon.  Again, the food was awesome.  And did I mention cheap?  The cookies are $1.25, and the sandwiches are $5.25, and come with a small side of potato salad.

The pasta is not bad.  Didn't try the pizza, which looked good.  Garlic knots were minuscule and average, four to an order, and the waitress handed us flimsy paper plates to set them on. Shortly, our soup came in proper bowls and indeed the white bean and escarole was excellent - pasta fagioli not so much.

Pasta in nice dishes, plenty of it.  The rigatoni with sausage dish had a way to fennel-strong sausage, but was al dente and piping hot.

Sweet ice tea by the glass - if you want unsweet it's only available in a bottle.
No coffee - weird in a place that offers cannoli's and zeppole.  How hard would it be to buy a coffeemaker and generate more cash and customer satisfaction?  No wine or beer, either.

This is a pizza place with some nice salads and pasta dishes, but it's not really a great dine - in experience.  Take-out would probably be the way to go.  Not at all an improvement on the former Rigatoni in same location, and I will detour elsewhere when i want to sit and enjoy Italian food.

On another occasion, I ordered food for pickup. I got the Bistec Palomilla (spelled wrong on the menu) and noticed the rice wasn't fresh.

"By far, the worst Indian restaurant I've ever eaten at. In general, I like Indian food. I went with my family during the weekend for the lunch buffet only to be completely disappointed. To start with, there was no good food options. Yes, at a ""buffet."" There were rices and sides but no good options if you eat meat.  They had Tandoori chicken...but...the first piece I got was colorful outside and completely raw inside (rare if we would be talking about a steak). The second piece I tried was blah, no flavor. Another meat option was a butter chicken but was also dry and with lack of flavor. They kept filling up the trays with veggies and rices but no real options to taste. I was there waiting for about 45 minutes but the meat dishes never came out.   I have eaten several times at Indian restaurants for both buffet and ordering from regular menu with fantastic options. How does Haveli ought to call this a lunch buffet when there's no food?! Unbelievable. It was probably 12:30pm when I was there so it was a good time to get lunch, no excuses to not have food.

"I felt a bit guilty for not continuing my best Cuban hunt last night, so this morning I decided to ask the folks at the Caribbean Sandwich shop if it was too early for a Cuban. The owner looked at me kinda odd, like ""huh?"". He started saying he didn't have pork this early in the morning, but then pipes up ""hang on, I think I may have some in the back"".

I love these guys. 

These guys are from Puerto Rico. They run a small but awesome little sandwich shop in a tiny little strip mall on Waters Avenue.  It's not much to look at, but looks can be deceiving.  They certainly are in this case.

If you are familiar with Puerto Rican cuisine, you know what a ""sancocho"" is.  Come and try it here.  It's only on Saturdays, and it's gone by 11am, so come early. 

So, how do these Puerto Ricans fare with a Cuban?

One word: outstanding.  

The trick is the bread and the pork, and on both counts they scored. The pork to ham ratio was still low by my standards, but closer to 2:1, which is a lot better than most other Cubans I've had lately.  And the pork was juicy and flavorful, the way pork should be.  Sorry Boar's Head, your pork doesn't even come close. 

I'd give this place 4.5 stars, but I pushed it to five for two reasons.  First, they are from Puerto Rico.  That counts in my book.  But second, the owner's willingness to accommodate my request show the pride they take in their business, and that's good for a 5th star any day.  I recommend them highly.

"The Brunchery is a new desayuno joint in New Tampa. It occupies the former Boston Market in the Starbucks/Orange Theory plaza adjacent to the AMC Highwoods 20. Brunchery is next door to Moe's.

They are open  from 7 am - 2pm and serve breakfast and lunch items.

Pros:
The white/black decor. It is clean and modern. I like first Watch but it feels a bit dull as a brown guy to go sit around in brown furniture (I can do that at home lol)

My server Jimmy was very warm and curious as to how I liked my meal. He kind of reminds me of a younger Mr. Feeny from Boy Meets World (K-I-T-T or Kitt if you prefer?)

I ordered the Orange Pecan French Toast ($9.25). It was 3 pieces of FT with orange flavored cream cheese and garnished with pecan fragments. It was very filling and had a different flavor profile. I wished it had more pecans personally.

I got my food in less than ten minutes. The place was clean and the hostess lady even gave me a free piece of baklava which was cool.  Prices are commensurate with places like first Watch and Keke's ($8-12/ person)

Misc.
I feel that their specialty pancake selection is less than first watch or Keke's. They had regular, pumpkin,and ones with fruit IIRC. They have egg related things, crepes, and other items so you wont be struggling to pick something. I am biased towards specialty pancakes and I saw on another brunchery menu things like ""coconut pancakes""  so I was a little dismayed that this branch doesnt have them.

"Such a disappointing experience. I remember coming to OC when it was this really grand, lavish dining experience. Today was far from that. We celebrated my mother's birthday here for brunch this morning. I understand their famed Sunday buffet is no more because of covid. Not a problem at all. In fact I prefer a seated meal.

The restaurant still has a killer view. And it looks like the main dining area is still quite nice. But we were given a weird, hobbled round table in the corner of this makeshift bar/server bus station in a wing of the restaurant. I knew I should have spoken up and changed tables. I wish I had.

The room was loud with bright fluorescent lights peering down. The chairs were old and sad. I read a review before deciding to write my own that compared the dining ambiance to that of a hospital cafeteria. I'd say that is an excellent description. A hospital cafeteria with a decent ocean view {if you are seated facing the windows; otherwise you are staring at a flimsy IKEA room divider that got thrown up to shield your eyes from the wait staff schelping food scraps in a waist basket}. Our ears were not so lucky.

But perhaps the most disappointing part of it all was the food. It was so boring. So basic. So bad. And so pricey. The Bloody Mary was straight V8 with nothing added. Not even sure if there was vodka? The mimosa? Uninspired. The charcuterie board? Ridiculous (in a lack luster way). The avocado toast? Well, my toast was burnt. The avocado tasted like those single serve guacamole packets you get with pretzel chips at an airport. Also, the menu said it was served with smoked salmon. Mine came with two small previously frozen shrimp.

I can keep going. The tacos? My husband said it tasted like something from a mall food court. The sushi? Meh. The Nutella pancake? $28 dollars does not justify one {singular} pancake with a ramekin of Nutella.

Look, my mom was happy. She's older. She didn't seem to notice the wallpaper peeling off the bathroom walls. But I did. And it was so sad. So much room for improvement. And so much opportunity to be a shining star (or oyster) in the Tampa Bay area.

"We come here occasionally. We had been looking for a good Mexican restaurant this summer, and this is our favorite in south Tampa (maybe all of Tampa, although there is a good spot, albeit quite different, up north called Mekenita). We moved from Tennessee, and our typical Mexican meal was really Tex-Mex. We haven't found a suitable replacement for our hole-in-the-wall Tex-Mex joint, but we have been venturing out of our old habits of Tex-Mex to find something a little different.

This is a nice smaller restaurant. We've tried several of their entrees, and they are all good. This is likely due to the fresh ingredients that they use. My favorite dishes are the guacamole (appetizer) and their chicken enchiladas (entree). 

The guacamole is fresh. Many places give you nice fresh guacamole. However, this particular guacamole is seasoned so well. The extra ingredients don't overpower the avocado, and they are all balanced. When I think about returning to eat here, one of the first things that comes to mind is how great the guacamole is. The chips are good -- probably a step above the average. The salsa is fine as well, but I would put it at just above average.

The chicken enchilada dish is particularly tasty. I like the green chile sauce. The tortilla shell, chile sauce, and the meat all work well together. The enchiladas are definitely one of the better items on the menu.

There are other parts that have been good: rice, beans, and tacos. The rice and beans are not only good, but they give you some variety. They give you some choices of how the rice is prepared. Both the rice and beans have the right amount of seasoning, and they complement the main entree. The tacos are definitely better than average. They don't measure up to some tacos that I've tasted in my travels, but they are nice and tasty. We have taken friends, and they liked their respective dishes as well.

All in all, we have been a handful of times, and the food is tasty. The staff have been really nice as well as the chef-owner.

This would also be my go to after the gym as it was going to be this night but after this visit Im skeptical about coming back here. I  walked in around maybe between 6:15-6:30ish (I encourage the owner to re-run the cameras) i came in on Nov 4th with a coupon I received in the mail for a Buy one get one half off. The moment we walked in all three staff members looked at my significant other and I and said ABSOLUTELY nothing to us. We proceeded to wait.... We noticed 2 staff members were wearing mask properly and 1 staff had her mask below her neck and when she seen us walk in she quickly slipped it up to cover her mouth. The lady who had her mask off and slipped it up proceeded to do what it appeared she was occupied doing prior to our entrance attending to food checks. Mind you she had her mask off and after touching her face/mask did not wash her hands and went straight to checking the temperatures on the foods laid out on display. As she's doing this still no acknowledgement of our presence or anything literally standing right in front of us no greetings hi's or hellos or reassurance that someone would be right with us. We probably stood for about 2-4mins  just waiting for someone to say something but crickets...it was slightly awkward...We took a step closer to observe in the case and noticed the food was not fresh, rice was super dry and there were black nats/flies buzzing around the food bar. At that moment It was my confirmation that this was not going to be the same experience I've had prior to the many times we had come here. I  don't know what's happened to this place but It's legit falling apart. This place is probably the only healthiest option on this side of town which is why it was a go-to instead of McDonald's or fast food.

This place has a pretty excellent location for late-night food, located in the middle of South Howard. I'm pretty sure if I had eaten here drunk, I would have given it 5 stars, however, I was DDing a bunch of drunken idiots when I came here and they all loved it. I've eaten at some pretty amazing hot dog places and this place does not even come close. If you want a good dog in Tampa go to Mel's up in North Tampa!

The Chicago Style Hot Dog was mediocre. I was not impressed with anything really -- the dog itself, the bun, the toppings... it tasted like a hot dog I could microwave up at home and then throw one some random toppings. The cheeseburger slides just tasted like McDonald's cheeseburgers. The chili cheese dog was decent, though, so if you were to come here, I would recommend that.

With that being said, get the chicken (pechuga de pollo) which is huge or the baby churrasco (skirt steak) and lather it with chimichurri sauce.

"We went for a Sunday drag show and made reservations for 7 over a week in advance. We arrived and were seated on two love seat couches ... definitely not comfortable - people in our group sat on the arm rests just to make room.  The server was friendly and explained the drink specials. She took our drink order and the drag show began. After this, we weren't ever given the option to order brunch food  (which consists of 4/5 flatbreads). We barely saw our server and never were given the option to order food. We ended up leaving and getting brunch somewhere else. The seating was physically uncomfortable and tight.

"Finally  visited Ana Delicias Bakery AGAIN! I am happy and sad that it's on a complete opposite side of town than I live. That might be a good thing because I would want to go all the time.

This little bakery is soo soo cute and they serve some amazing Dominican cakes.  I was following their Instagram for some time and they are a work of art. Not only a work of art though, they are so good and stand out above the rest in terms of desserts. It's been a long time I've felt that way too.

Last time I was here, I really wanted one of their cakes ordered from my birthday, but my hubby didn't want to because of the distance. It's understandable.  Next time we will though! 

This time around I tried their carrot cake. It's not a number 1 option for me elsewhere but with it having chocolate and dulce de leche it was quite different than I've ever had. I had their alfajores again. They are short bread cookies with dulce de leche. They are my favorite.  Last time I tried their passion fruit mousse. I love all things passion fruit.

My hubby tried the cookies and cream and the chocolate cake and he loved them so much.

This is a huge favorite for us!! Definitely check it out!!!",34,C,Ana Delicias Bakery,Ana Delicias Bakery,Ana Delicias Bakery Inc.,5.0
"I feel a moral obligation to write this review. 

My husband and I had dinner here last Sunday, we arrived at dinner time and the place was a ghost town (should have been a clue) the service was good heck even the food tasted good however shortly after eating the appetizer my stomach became irritated. I didn't think much of it I figured I ate to fast. I was to full to eat any of my dinner so I had it boxed to take home. My husband on the other hand ate his meal which was grilled chicken. We paid the bill and headed home (which is only 15 minutes away). We didn't even get halfway home when suddenly my husband started getting severe stomach pain then he became increasingly nauseous. Luckily we made it home without any real troubles... that came later. My poor husband was in and out of bathroom all night. 

Now... I can't say for certain that he got food poisoning because he didn't see a doctor and we didn't get the food tested in a lab but in my opinion and his he got food poisoning. 
Of course about an hour into his bathroom adventure I decided to check out this establishments record with the department of health... let's just say had I checked them out first we would have NEVER gone there to begin with.",1,A,Carmel Kitchen & Wine Bar,Carmel Kitchen & Wine Bar,Carm3l Kitch3n & Win3 Bar,1.0
"2.5 I've been here twice now. Once for drinks and we left because we had a bartender who must have lost the Mr Congeniality pageant and then again this past Saturday night just for the club. I simply did not like this DJ. He'd play 30 seconds of a good song then make the worse transition possible into a not so good song and throw in Little John screaming just to make sure the crowd was still awake.

I guess this place is an 'institution' because they don't charge a cover - which is nice. And honestly I've actually seen people more appropriately dressed here than at some places that charge a $10 cover. Lots of girls in club gear, some girls in jeans and nice tops. 

What makes me bump up this review from a straight 2 stars is the interior. It is super cool. They have a small dance floor just behind the outdoor patio right next to a colorful glowing bar. Then around the corner they have this cool seating area with small cocktail tables where girls can rest their dancing feet (Thank You!). And lastly the have this loft where there is another bar and a bigger dance floor.

"truly disgusting!! We live locally and are new to the area and decided to try it, despite the outdated questionable appearance.  We should have followed our instincts and stayed away.  
My husband and I both previously lived in NYC and do have high expectations when it comes to food especially Italian food but this place wasn't mediocre, it was repulsive!!  
I ordered the Chicken parm which did not look right.  It appeared they had used prepared(bagged)chicken fingers for their chicken- no nice juicy chicken cutlets hand breaded and pan fried, these things came out of the freezer aisle at restaurant depot. A serious disappointment!   Secondly, their sauce looked almost brown, which is never a good sign.  I think it must have been cooking for years to look this bad.  It tasted as bad as it looked.  There was nothing fresh about it. It had a very uniform texture almost like ketchup and tasted bitter and way too garlicky.  Ragu would have been a huge improvement!! At this point in the meal,  I looked at my husbands lasagna which had the same brown colored sauce and looked equally unappetizing and asked him how it was.  He shrugged and said not good.  He said it tasted freezer burned and also complained about the sauce.  I said, enough, we're not eating this crap.  We complained about the food and promptly left, never, ever to return again.  
Not sure how this place stays in business because it is always empty and only ever has happy hour people drinking outside but whatever the case may be- don't eat there!!",7,A,Rick's Italian Cafe,Rick's Italian Cafe,Rick's It@li@n C@fe,1.0

I believe I've been 4 times now and I always look forward to my next visit. My wife and I sat inside the first time and it was very intimate and the next few times we were outside on the patio and it was totally different and yet terrific at the same time. They also have a bar area with high tops and brings a totally different vibe yet. The servers are always excellent, quite possibly unsurpassed in my opinion and informative if need be. I have to say that I have never had better Mexican food. You end up with top level food, service, and ambiance for a reasonable price. I believe that the wife and I have averaged about $60 for an appetizer, entree's and a drink each.

"Pretty disastrous for a pizzeria. The main things you have to do are: take orders, cook pizzas, give them to customers - but if you fail on that last part, you're pretty much doomed since it's the goal of the whole interaction.

I will say that after the Outback Bowl and the evening of New Year's Day, Armature Works and the riverfront were packed! The whole place was bustling and we probably did not know what we were in for when we stopped here before heading back to Central Florida. Seeing a few vegetarian pizzas and almost no line, we chose this place over the on-site vegan restaurant. Several times after that we both said how much we regretted this choice.

The menu is simple enough and sounds great - especially for a lover of traditional, Neapolitan pizzas from a brick oven, like myself! The ordering process was easy - it's definitely not cheap pizza, but it was fair considering what they were offering. She mentioned it would be about 15 minutes (no problem for us) so we grabbed a seat in the common area until a seat at the bar area opened up. The pizzaiolos knew what they were doing, and were working together to put pizza after pizza in the oven.

We ordered some type of pizza with spinach and a few other veggies on it and after 15 minutes or so we thought we saw it come out of the oven - but after some time our buzzer never went off, so we assumed it wasn't ours. Fast forward 10 more minutes and we don't see our pizza being made, but what we do see is a backlog of 15 pizzas piled everywhere they can fit while the expediter just looked at the tickets, pizzas, and then the tickets, and pizzas, and then the tickets again - trying to figure out what to even do. (The answer is: cut pizzas, hand them to customer).

When I went up to see what was going on, I could see my pizza sitting 18 inches directly between us. I stood there a few minutes waiting to get her attention, and not once did she look up, or even serve a pizza - she just looked confused. Finally, the cashier and expediter switched places to bail our her co-worker. I pointed out that my pizza was right there, it's been 30+ minutes, and we just want to eat it before it gets cold. Unfortunately, once it was given to me, the pizza was ice cold (it had been sitting 20 minutes now) and it wasn't even sliced. I had to return it (another 5 minutes of standing at the pick-up window waiting to get noticed), explain the problem, and then wait for an entirely new pizza to be made.

This place needs some training! And some systems in place! And a manager! The pizza crew did a great job, but the service staff soured the experience for nearly every customer I saw. By the time we left, there were customers waiting everywhere to be served pizzas that had been done cooking for 15+ minutes, no one was happy, and we all shared some type of collective regret for spending our $30 here.",31,C,Ava Pizzeria Neapolitan,Ava Pizzeria Neapolitan,Ava Pizzeria Neapolitan Inc.,2.0
"I just don't understand how this place was so busy. I waited over 15 minutes at the bar to be acknowledge or asked if I needed a menu.  Once I looked over the menu the bartender only took one person's order and ignored mine for aps. When they came out the visual presentation of the chicken nachos was horrible. Nacho cheese on one side of the plate only and the salsa was only in one small area of the huge place of chips. The chicken was scarse across the plate as well. Once I actually got a completed nacho (chicken, cheese, salsa) put together and bit into it I wished I hadn't. I don't know what they do to that chicken but it was gross. None of the flavors on that plate blended well together at all. Round two... gumbo. It really had to makings to be good IF they wouldn't have make the dish using burnt sausage. The burnt flavor carried throughout the entire cup and bowl of Gumbo. While spooning around in the bowl you could clearly see just how burnt each piece of sausage was. The Rolls.... man those would have almost been perfect until they put some kind of BBQ sauce on top of them.  Those two things do not go together and completely ruined the roll.  I took my napkin and wiped it off just to try to get something edible from this experience. The smoked wings were good but if you could call those wings due to unbelievably small size.

"New York Buffet is a horrible option if you want variety and a clean restaurant. The waitstaff is very rude. My experience was better with family than alone. All the food was cold and old. Especially the seafood.

When I arrived I was quoted one price then I was asked to pay up front which was confusing because not only was a I charged a higher price but I thought you pay after you eat at these establishments. I was told it was more because HE added taxes and gratuities.

So I paid for the buffet upfront without seeing what was being served and I was seated by a central air unit leaking dirty water. My waitress never addressed me or came to visit my table outside of her dropping off a drink while I was getting a plate.

I ended up eating fruit and soup because no  fresh food was out just scraps of what was left out. The food wasn't labeled correctly or at all. There wasn't a good, great or even okay selection.

During my time their I noticed other tables receiving checks.

So I said excuse me to the waitress which she tried so hard to ignore me until she couldn't and I asked her why was I charged up front and everyone else is being charged afterwards. She literally laughed and walked off. She never came back with an answer instead she sat at a table in the front of the restaurant eating her lunch.

At this point I addressed the guy who originally charged me and I asked him can I speak to a manager. He then says ok what happened. He never said yes I am the manager. He never apologized for the service or lack there of. So I asked him why was I charged upfront instead of after my meal. I even told him how his employee laughed when I asked her. And his exact response was because you wanted to pay first. Wow. 

So I left and just called my credit card company to dispute the charge and I also reported them for unsanitary conditions and practices.

And also people leaving 5 stars for this dump had to be high, hungry or an employee because they definitely do not deserve three, four or even five stars.

"Went here as it's closer than the Palma Ceia location, albeit neither are too far of a distance.  Tend to only come on the rare occasion my husband has a hankering for wings. In the past, we've had questionable service and were hoping that this had improved, as it's been at least  a year since the last visit. We quickly realized things have remain unchanged, if not worse.

We weren't sure if we needed to wait to be seated or seat ourselves as there wasn't a sign or staff around, so we sat ourselves near the entrance. Server eventually came to our table and meals came quickly enough. Husband eventually needed a refill and we both looked around occasionally (5 mins or so), no sight of our server. I finally got up and walked over to who appeared to be the manager and requested the refill. Came shortly after by our original server.  Not sure where she had been?  When we were ready to pay the bill, again, no server in sight - waited for quite some time (again) and finally gave up and walked up to the bar to have them sign us out. It was hardly a busy night, it was actually fairly empty, so that was not a possible factor into the poor service.  

If the food was great, I would have given another star, but my food, coupled with the terrible service is just unacceptable.  Husband said wings were ok, while my food and our app left much to be desired. I know I will not return and not sure if I will even go to another location.

"It's probably too early to judge, but my first visit to Bin 27 revealed a ton of potential in this new south Tampa spot. For starters, the space is beautiful -- sleek and contemporary, but still elegant -- which is sort of hard to believe if you ever spent much time at the old Cafe Con Trey. It also didn't hurt that my server was friendly, efficient and knowledgeable. The menu is loaded with tempting selections, and I finally settled on the beef ossobuco, a unique twist on a classic dish. It's actually a rib cut shank-style, braised with guava, served over garlic mashed potatoes and stewed vegetables, then sprinkled with a citrus gremolata. The meat was fork-tender, and the flavors blended enough to create a sense of consonance but not so much as to disappear into one another altogether. Granted, it would've been nice to be able to actually see what I was eating and, yeah, the wine list could be a bit less predictable (especially considering the restaurant's name). But even so, I'll definitely be back to sample the rest of what is a fairly tantalizing menu -- at least on paper. Early indicators lead me to believe I won't be disappointed.

Grab my order and left at 6:58 PM and I didn't get my food until 7:40 pm I sat on the phone for more than 20 minutes almost trying to speak to somebody and nobody would answer the phone this place is a joke and customer number service is ass , never ever again ordering from this place that's why I stay true to Pizza Hut 

After 20 minutes and multiple phones calling the same place they finally answered one of our phones and their excuse is our driver has more than seven deliveries who the hell grabs more than seven deliveries and goes the most farthest place and then leave us for last when we're not even six minutes away thanks to them we got are food cold as hell.

"There aren't many places around where you can get a good meal for $5. The ""Cheep Cheep"" special at Gladstone's is certainly one of them, and a lifeline to broke college students at my alma mater (USF) for over 20 years now.

A delicious grilled chicken breast, one side (the mac n cheese is always a winner), and a pita served with their highly addictive honey butter for $4.79 is quite a savory bargain. There are plenty of other choices, but I'd bet this alone has to be at least half of their business.

Also they started doing $1 pitchers of beer to help get some people in the door. Not sure if it's working, but give them credit for being creative to get some people to taste their delicious chicken.

Haiku has a good atmosphere and the service was good.
We ordered the steam pork gyoza and Brussels sprouts for the appetizer which I absolutely love! 
For dinner we had the Citrus Salmon roll, pork belly fried rice, and the crispy chicken fried rice and honestly... it wasn't great. We thought it was pretty mediocre tasting. The sushi roll I had tasted more like an orange rind and bitter. The fried rice didn't really taste like it had too much flavor. It was a little more bland. 
For those reasons, we have to give it a two star.

Tonight I was downtown with the kids and we were hungry. Taco Bus was convenient and a crowd pleaser so I called in an order for pick up.

I order pastor tacos on corn. By the time I got home 10 min later, my shells had completely failed and the filling was spilling out the bottom. It was obvious by the color and texture of the shells that they had not been prepared correctly. Nearly raw, in desperate need of a pan toasting. Annoying but forgiveable. Not to be deterred, I grabbed a fork and went to town. 

Whatever I was eating was nothing like any pastor I had ever had. Certainly nowhere in the realm of Loli's! It was a sloppy, bland mess of shredded (?) protein with not even a hint of pineapple. I ate one and trashed the other two.

"Why 5 stars? Because this is one of the better lobster rolls in TB.

   ---   ---   ---

On night one of the Heights Public Market being open to the public, my wife and I frantically marched around in an attempt to decide which vendors we would choose to visit for this momentous occasion. We agreed that Surf and Turf would have to be one of them because lobster rolls are one of our favorite things in the world.

As much as I love lobster any form, we both agree that a lobster roll is best served warm with butter, rather than chilled. Thankfully, Surf and Turf offers you either choice, so we scored the hot, buttery version.

After one bite, the buttery toast really stood out to me. While the lobster is always the star of the show, the quality of the roll is ultra crucial. This roll passed the test with flying colors. And the lobster itself was definitely quite meaty and delicious. 

I've since tried quite a few vendors from Heights Public Market and Surf and Turf is definitely one of my favorites!

Now this isn't a traditional smokehouse.  The BBQ is cooked in electric ovens.  I had favorites and I had disappointments.  The brisket is the definite winner here.   It is moist and flavorful.  The baby back ribs are quite good and far better than the St Louis ribs.   The pulled pork is good, not great.  I did not like the chicken or the turkey.  The sides are solid.

On one occasion, there were only 7 tables in the entire restaurant, yet our meal took 2.5 hours. EVERY table was complaining to the manager about the service. By the time our server came to our table, he was just so embarrassed (there was some sort of screw up in the kitchen). He offered us a free dessert, but then 40 minutes after he placed the dessert order, the chef came out and said ""I'm so sorry, we don't have any more tiramisu."" So I ordered another dessert and she said ""I'm sorry we don't have that either."" So I ordered a third dessert (cannolis) at her recommendation. It was good. 

The one redeeming quality about this location is that they really do go the distance to make things right. The manager ended up comping my entire meal on that occasion. Granted, the service is not usually THIS bad, but we have dealt with other screw ups, including overcooked seafood, long waits, incorrect orders, and forgetting to apply discounts on every other visit we've had at this location.

   ---   ---   ---

I found this food truck a while back on Yelp and have been stalking their Facebook page pretty thoroughly as I've tried to find a time to visit them that made sense. It ended up working out that I visited them at an office park in Clearwater, near my wife's office, so that she could meet us for lunch.

All of that time stalking Facebook was well worth it because I thoroughly enjoyed this meal!

I ordered the #1 - steak skewers with rice and beans and I opted to add plantains. My wife ordered the #2, which had chicken skewers instead of steak. I really loved both of these, but thought that the steak was the start of the show. 

The rice and beans were honestly perfect - everything I'd hope for in this staple of a side dish duo. Plus, each meal was served with some kind of breading that's called farofa, which was an amazing compliment for the meat.

Lastly, I ordered a can of Guarana, which is a Brazilian soda that was described as ""like gingerale with cherry,"" which completely sold me. I loved every last drop of it.

If I ever see this truck out again, I will definitely stop what I'm doing and head to the counter!",18,B,Open Fire Grilled Brazilian,Open Fire Grilled Brazilian,Op3n Fir3 Grill3d Brazilian,5.0

Our server Eric was superb! He had a wealth of knowledge on the menu and had some good recommendations. He also was very quick and attentive. 

The food was pretty good. Honestly my favorite thing was the side salad. The island vinaigrette is basically like a citrus vinaigrette and it is super light and refreshing. The side salad also can come with pumpkin seeds. They were so delicious. I had the Churasco skirt steak. I wish the chimichurri sauce was better it was really just a lot of lime juice. I also got tostones, I wanted them in addition to the rice and beans and plantains, but they came instead of. I liked Eric too much to hassle him to switch it. My boyfriend got the grilled chicken with mashed potatoes. The chicken had a really good flavor and it came with a yummy cream sauce. We got coconut shrimp and that was also pretty good. I'm not the biggest fan of a honey mustard sauce though.

"A small restaurant that maybe made their bar too much of a focal point, somewhat unexpected considering the limited seating and liquor selection. I think the bar could have been much smaller. The ambiance is modern and the wood flooring is a nice touch. 

We ordered the lobster quesadilla $15 and the lobster roll $19. It should be noted that aside from salads ( no protein included) the cheapest entree on the lunch menu is $12 dollars and all items are served with coleslaw, anything more is at least a $3 dollar up charge. The bread used on the lobster roll was great and the coleslaw, a bit too sweet, was still refreshing. The lobster portions were frugal. The quesadilla may have had 1.5 ounces and the lobster roll at most had 2.5 ounces (looks like more because of he large slabs of bread and bed of lettuce). 

This restaurant is new and may need to work things out. All entrees should include fries, there should be sandwich options under $12 dollars, and there should be a true lunch menu.

My husband and I used to come here at least once a week before the change because the food an service were so great.  The decor was changed to standard cookie cutter, everyone shops from the same store, decor.  Even the smallest details like creamer and jelly were changed to an off brand.  The food was terrible.  This change must have happened a week before we went in, because the new owner was in there while we were trying to eat.  Instead of saying hello and making light conversation, he was intrusive and watched his employee's like a hawk.  It was very uncomfortable.  The atmosphere of the old restaurant was gone, and we couldn't wait to leave.  I feel sorry for the staff, as they are probably having to deal with the brunt of the change.

"I am not a huge juicer but when I am feeling crappy after a lot of heavy eating or I want to look skinny for a beach day, I do a one day juice cleanse to flatten the tummy. 

If you have not done a juice cleanse, this is a great place to try it because the juices are fairly easy to drink and that is because the put a lot of fruit in their juices (and you get a lot of fluid to keep you from feeling hungry all the time). Now there is a con to that because you're not getting as many veggies with these cleanses as with others. Still, you have the benefit of a juice cleanse without holding your nose trying to get through the drinks. 

The other great thing is they have several juices to choose from so you can tailor your juice cleanse to better fit your taste.

If you're already a hard core juicer, Squeeze maybe too much fruit juice for you. FK's juice cleanse regime leans very heavy towards veggies and are Less calories bc they use less fruit juices  which is great but then I was holding my nose trying to get through several of FK's juices. 

With Squeeze they request you give them 48 hrs advance notice to do a juice cleanse. Well, I can't plan that far in advance sometimes. I called up the day I wanted to do a cleanse and luckily they had enough premade to do it. 

The ladies at the St Pete location are far more helpful and informative than the lady I encountered at the Tampa location. I won't take a star away from one person's poor customer service skills from an otherwise great company though.

Things are well priced too.  I got a jug... a 1.1lb JUG... of za-tar spice for 5 bucks.  Seriously.   There are many good deals to be had here!   The bulk beans are also well priced, and a great option in times like these.

The selections of teas put me over the edge.  I needed to be escorted out of the aisle otherwise I'd have shot my whole budget there alone!   I can't wait to go back...",37,C,Al-Aqsa Grocery,Al-Aqsa Grocery,Al-Aqsa Grocery Inc.,4.0

"Such a waste of what could be a really cool sports bar.  Me and a few friends went in the other day for some drinks and appetizers.  First impression was they did a great job in decorating the place with lots of TVs and cool sports memorabilia.  Unfortunately that is where anything good stopped.



The service was absolutely pathetic! Had some guy named Dylan who was a nice enough guy, was either totally incompetent, or it was like his first week on the job.   He didn't even make it over to our table for 20 minutes after we sat down.  Another 10 minutes to get our drink order out to us, and then either tried to pull scams (or again the incompetent factor) made our checkout process a total nightmare.  They advertise all over the menu and in the bar that it is always two-for-one drinks, but when we went to check out only one of our drinks have been comped.   We talked to the manager who was completely useless and couldn't care less about our situation and put the problem back on the server.

My strong recommendation is to steer clear of this bar/restaurant.  Way too many other good options nearby.   

Just an FYI that my friends and I are very laid-back and easy to please, but this experience was so bad that it got my blood boiling.  My friends had to talk me down from making a scene and decided it was best just to get out of there.  The friend who talked me down is a sports bar manager in another state and told me that if that was his bar people would be losing their jobs over the terrible service that we encountered.",6,A,Duffy's Sports Grill,Duffy's Sports Grill,duffy's sports grill,1.0

"Came here on a weekend as we were craving Indian food. A little confusing when you walk in because your not really greeted by a hostess or anything and its kind of quiet inside as there was not music or TVs playing. Our entire experience was pretty much just find a seat, go to the fixings bar, get your food then pay at the end.

I don't think anyone even came to our table, checked on us or even talked to us. So we just helped ourselves to the fixings bar, got our food, ate, drank the water they provided in the coolers, paid, then left.

The food though was not bad. There is a waiter who just keeps replenishing the items when they get low on the fixings bar and a scramble to get the hot fresh dosas as soon as there ready. Filled with potato's, they had a very nice tasty crisp  and I easily had about 4 of these. My favorite was the tamarind sauce when paired with the dosa made a great meal. They also had other bread like items that you can dip with other Curry's and sauces they had at the fixings bar but I had no idea what I was eating at all because there really was no one to ask.

"My family and I decided to have lunch here today. 

The Kiwami ramen was full of flavor. The pork belly was cooked perfectly and you could taste the smoke flavor coming through. The noodles tasted like they were made with love. The sushi was fresh and the service was fast. Probably because we were one of the only ones there (they were closing at 3pm). 

The greeter who sat us had an attitude. I'm assuming because my husband asked if we could be seated at 2:30 and she told us they closed at 3 so we couldn't order. He asked her if they closed at 3, why couldn't we order? She was finally like, yea you're right, let's get you seated. I wish they had more options for chicken broth for ramen. My husband doesn't eat pork or beef and most of the ramen items had pork broth. The only one who didn't have pork broth was shoyu ramen.

"What can I say, I grew up with Krystal and White Castle. Whether it was late at night after being out for the evening or on the way to work in the morning nursing a hangover it was always great comfort food. Why am I saying what it still is.!

They've added little chili cheese hot dogs to their overall crystal menu which are just as enticing as a regular Krystal burger. I know, I know this is not a burger, burger but it's a Krystal burger. Come on you gotta know these things and love them. They are what they are and they don't pretend to be anything else.

I accept them for exactly what they are and appreciate them for their healing and comfort food feeling that they give me. I know everybody doesn't feel the same but this is the childhood memory that I have been able to carry on throughout my entire life. I enjoy them as much today as I did when I was a child. The addition of the chili cheese pups are just a bonus.

I understand crystal may not be for everybody but, it is open 24 hours a day which makes it very convenient. There's only two of them in town which makes it very inconvenient depending on where you live. But for some of us, it will always be part of our unhealthy diet. I pride myself on not eating fast food but this is the one I frankly just refuse to give up.

"It's amazing how the best barbeque always seems to come from these little roadside stands, and Ice Cream's Delicious Turkey Legs and BBQ is one of the rockstars in Tampa for cranking out some incredibly wonderful smoked meats.

Drop south on 22nd Street, just 2 blocks south of Hillsborough Avenue and watch for the little red trailer tucked under the trees. You'll be able to smell the smoke as you approach, and no doubt you'll see a line of people waiting for their chance to order some damn good barbeque.

The menu is very simple......ribs, thin ends, barbequed chicken, and smoked turkey legs. The sides are baked beans, potato salad and sweet potato pie. On Thursdays and Friday's he also makes collard greens and Mac & Cheese. He'll wrap everything up in foil if you want to take it to go, or you can sit on the picnic bench under the trees and eat it right there. If you choose to sit outside on the picnic bench watch out for the ants and the flies -- in fact I'd suggest a good spray-down with Off so you don't get bitten by the fire ants.

Ice Cream is the nickname of the cook, owner, and guy in the truck, sort of a jack of all trades who really knows how to smoke the meat and produce some homemade sauce that has a nice kick. Very personable guy who is proud of what comes out of his smoker -- and rightly so. This is some incredibly tasty barbeque.

The meat is flavorful, but not dried out. The ribs were still juicy, and fall-off-the-bone delicious. My girlfriend ordered the smoked chicken, and she was in heaven. I liked everything so much that I ordered a smoked turkey leg to have for dinner later tonight. Ice Cream wrapped the turkey leg in several sheets of aluminum foil and gave me some extra barbeque sauce. When it's time for dinner, I'll just cut the meat off the bone, add the sauce, and re-heat.

"Caracolillo Coffee Mills was recommendation from a well respected coffee  professional; however, I came to find out the recommendation was quite dated. He even stated that the quality had gone down hill. I can confirm it has. I would not do business with CCM.

CCM states, they ""offer a superior array of distinctive blends prepared from the finest coffee beans in the world.... You can not beat our price or quality of our beans at any price...We taste many samples to find the best tasting beans available.""

I've found this to be extremely inaccurate. There is a link at the end of this review to show why. The coffee tastes horrible too, even after taking out as many defective beans as I could before roasting. It was clear that the green coffee was old and probably sitting in a warehouse for a long time by the way roasts developed. I couldn't believe just how many defects there were. Some bags were complete throw always due to extensive insect damage. 

CCM also says, ""We guarantee your satisfaction. If your unhappy for any reason we will replace the product or refund your money."" I contacted the company and received no response what so ever. Not much surprise seeing that everything else they said was untrue. The only benefit I see in all this is a tangible experience with green coffee defects. I literally came across every defect.

Don't say you were not warned. There are much better options for buying both unroasted and roasted coffee at a much better value.

Today husband said ""I have a craving for a tuna sandwich from Subway."" So we headed there for lunch.

On the way I was puzzled about the super Subway request, and we chatted more. He said:
This is the best Subway. It is well run, very clean on the inside, and the food is well prepped and taken care of.

We arrived and the shop was immaculate and had just been remodeled.  I did notice when nobody was in line the cabinets that the sandwich fixings are kept in are kept closed.

"The Tilted Kilt chain has come to Tampa! ... I say that not ever having been to any other Tilted Kilt, or even knowing that it was a chain (or having heard of it) till my friends suggested checking it out, which prompted me to look it up online, thereby discovering said chain-ness. Wow, that was a runon sentence & a half. My bad.

So anyway it's an interesting place; a Hooters for people who think tartan is sexy, if you will. The waitresses are clad in red plaid miniskirts & cropped white button-down shirts which are tied under the bust to bare their red plaid bras & flat stomachs, many adorned with a belly button ring. They're not all skinny, but they are all attractive.

There's a patio area with an outdoor bar where you can smoke & enjoy the cool Tampa evenings -- I'm sorry, did I say cool? I meant sweltering. We sat inside when we checked it out a couple of weeks ago, at a table next to the ""captain's bar"" -- which, if you're like me & you've never heard of such a thing, is a long standalone counter, NEXT to the bar. So it's a bar without the bartender. Weird.

The inside is separated into rough areas by the ceiling, oddly enough; it's a fairly high ceiling & there's like, a few beams that come down a foot & a half or so, that are painted to match the decor. There are limericks painted on the inside of the 4 beams that we were sitting under, & on the outside wall (probably more, too, that I couldn't see). I'll have to remember to write them down next time I'm there.

That night 3 of us had cocktails, & 1 tried a new beer (they have a pretty decent selection). Us mixed drink drinkers ordered from the specialty menu. I had the Tilted Tea, a take on a Long Island, if you will, which has (I quote from their website) ""vodka, rum, gin, tequila, & a splash of sweet & sour"". I liked it a lot.

One of my companions had the Purple Passion (""vodka, peach Schnapps, blue curacao, sprite, cranberry juice, & sweet & sour""), which I found a bit too sweet for my tastes but she liked a lot.

My other companion had the Dirty Girl Scout (""kahlua, vodka, green creme de mint (menthe!), white creme de cocoa (cacao!), chocolate syrup & cream"") -- a take on a grasshopper, if you will. I thought it was pretty good & so did he.

I wanted to munch, so I ordered the onion rings, which were way greasy -- I'm talking, SOGGY -- and totally bland. The sauce they came with was super watery, & they just pretty much sucked. I hear tell that their food (as in entrees) is pretty good, though, & I liked the cocktails so I'll be heading back sometime for sure.",36,C,Tilted Kilt Pub and Eatery,Tilted Kilt Pub and Eatery,Tilted Kilt Pub @nd E@tery,4.0

Location, bottom floor at the International Mall. A hidden gem away from the hustle and bustle of the food court and other restaurants.

Probably the best burgers I've had hands down. So many options, you can find pretty much anything for your palette. The portion size is insanely big, you will have no problem feeling full. You can also substitute out the protein for turkey or a vegetarian option. Be prepared to wait a bit because they prepare your meal on the spot. So if you are in a rush, I would not necessarily recommend. Otherwise I highly recommend with no reservations.

Finally became personally acquainted last night. Walking out of Drynk around 1:45, I was in severe need of post-drinking food and suddenly thought, ""isn't that legendary food truck parked around here???"" As I walked up the street, the truck glistened like a mirage down Howard Ave. I tried to explain how I knew about it to my boyfriend but he was already drooling over the menu. We ordered a grilled cheese & a broken egg and a bottle of water for good measure. BTW, cutest bottle of water ever--- love the graphics! Nice touch!! The sweet girl at the window kindly answered our 75 questions about the menu, and her HS t-shirt while we waited for our food (thanks!!).

Once it was ready, we continued home to dive in. The chips on the side were to die for. I liked the broken egg better than the grilled cheese but both were superb. Can't wait to go back- next time I'm tracking down the truck on a weeknight for some gourmet food, food truck style. Will definitely make a quick & easy gourmet meal on a busy weeknight.

We also ate in the bar, so I missed watching the open kitchen/grill master technique, but that's just another reason to go back.

I had them leave off the tomato, onion and aioli and it still packed a huge flavor punch with fully melted and gooey Muenster cheese and crispy bacon (four big pieces).

From what I see, there is a weekday lunch menu for a really affordable price. We came on a Saturday afternoon. That lunch menu was not in effect, but the prices are still quite affordable and the plates are mountainous.

I had a half a dozen mussels(choritos a la chalaca) which was so good and a good size.  I also split the beef & noodles and still had leftovers.

I went here with my husband last night for dinner, since it was within walking distance we were hoping it would be a good place to add to our lunch/dinner repertoire. But, it will definitely not be a place we will be returning to. 
The buffalo fried shrimp was this place's only saving grace--served with blue cheese dip and slices of celery. 
The Chicken Fajita salad was absolutely revolting. The chicken was so spicy that I literally spit it out. Why on earth wouldn't they put ""spicy"" in the description if it burns your mouth to the point of needing three glasses of water? My husband had shrimp and fish, with a side of green beans. And I didn't know it was possible to ruin green beans, but this place changed my opinion of that. 
I was also grossly disappointed that they don't offer any dessert of any kind (to help quench my desire to put something sweet in my mouth after putting out the spicy fire within).

He quickly went to the kitchen when he saw I was hungry and came back out with some of the best chicken i have tasted in Tampa. I was willing to settle for some mediocre chicken since they had been closed but he came out with a fresh piece of chicken. 

This food was fresh and delicious. The owner spent 4 trips to peru collecting peppers to create a dipping sauce that is just perfect with the tender chicken. What made this deal even more a amazing was the price. I had a quarter of some succulent chicken for only 3 dollars!

"Aweful!
Flyer in my hotel room and ordered seafood pizza and a meatball and cheese calzone.
Ordered no sauce in the calzone.. order came and sauce was in the calzone and the pizza was like cardboard. The ""seafood"" on the pizza was supposed to be shrimp and crab. The shrimp were the itsy bitsy shrimps the size of a dime and the crab was the imitation crap... NOT crab as advertised. I counted 29 on the extra large pizza - again, they are the size of a DIME. The ""crab"" was just over a heaping tablespoon... again, this is an extra large pizza.
I call them immediately so the driver could turn around come back and get the food and reimburse me. The girl told me she would have to get her manager and that she knows she wrote down on the calzone no sauce. A guy named Mario picked up the phone and said he's sorry he made the food he'll bring me another calzone. I said no thank you you ruined my dinner plus the pizza is absolutely awful; it's dry and there's no seafood on it and I'm not paying $20 for a piece of cardboard. He said ""Too bad, I'm in charge of the food and I'll give you a partial refund but you're not getting fully refunded just because you don't like the food"". I told him to come back and get his food I don't want it this is not meeting my expectations in any way and he hung up on me.
I called back Mario answered and I said I want a refund he said I'm not getting one and hung up again.

"Definitely a fun place to brunch.

Ignore their website. Just don't even look at it. I study websites before I go someplace so I know exactly what I want and this one shows menus that are nothing like what is at the restaurant. 

For example, the website says their lunch menu is available starting from when they open. Lies. Only their brunch menu is available at noon on a Sunday. Their brunch menu is not the one on the website. Their drink menu is different too. I was going to get milk punch and it turns out they no longer make it. I was actually really disappointed that I wasn't going to be able to order their PB and J when they said they didn't serve lunch, but turns out, it is on their restaurant brunch menu! TL:DR is don't try to determine what you want ahead of time, because you may end up disappointed. 

ATMOSPHERE - This is not a fancy ladies who brunch place. It is a bar that happens to be open during the day and serves food. It looks like it would be a fun place to be at night. 

FOOD - I was really excited about the PB and J and it turned out to be meh. I feel like I could have made it at home. The fries that came with it were delicious though and had lots of flavor. It's a good meal if you're trying to soak up alcohol.

DRINKS - No they didn't have my milk punch, but they make a mean gin fizz. It was absolutely delicious. This is also the place that you can do breakfast shots and nobody bats an eye. Their drink menu is full of fun cocktails so this is definitely the type of menu I love perusing.

It was pretty empty for brunch on a Sunday. Service is a bit slow because I don't think they expect many people, but if you come to have a leisurely brunch, then it can be quite enjoyable.",20,B,The Big Easy,The Big Easy,The Big Easy Inc.,4.0
"Having spent the a lot of my life In The NYC area, I have yearned for a taste of a true NYC pizza(Pie) here in Tampa.  The search has been allusive at best.
Bruno's is situated on north Sheldon between a car wash and a Shell station, but don't let that fool you.  They have a true brick pizza oven, the paramount of a true NYC pizza.  Unfortunately there are no tables, just a bar counter against the window, so your best bet is pick up or delivery.  But ""not for nothin"", a pie is as much about getting together with good friends as well as enjoying a great pie.
I ordered the 18"" Margarita pizza.  I was told 15 minutes.  I arrived 20 minutes later and they were just putting it in the oven.  No problem, I had some free time, and they were busy for a Tuesday night at 7pm.  So no worries.
Honestly the pie smelt great!  When I saw it I noticed the typical novice mistake.  The majority of the topping were not evenly distributed around the pie, but centered in the middle leaving about an inch inside of the crust empty of toppings.  This results in all the fluids from the topping to pool in the middle of the pie and cause it to bake unevenly and 'sog' in the middle. More importantly, when you pick the slice up the toppings tend to slide right off.  This is the paramount of a poorly prepared pie.
Surely, when I grabbed a slice and folded it the middle, the pie was still wet and the toppings slid right off.
Positives - the tomatoes were very fresh not canned !  Probably one of the best I have had on a Marg.  The basis was fresh, not the canned spice.  However I ordered extra basil and it was all piled at the center area of the pie.  I would have preferred it spread evenly over the entire pie.
Negatives - crust was VERY  bland, lacked salt.  Mozzarella was hard to taste (very odd).  Toppings were centered in the middle causing a soggy pie.  
Bottom line, the potential is there, the ingredients are fresh, and it's an ok pie, just not the quality of a good NYC pie.

Trick... When you call a pizza restaurant that claims to be authentic .. Ask for a ""Pie"" if they don't know what you mean... Just pass, and look elsewhere!",7,A,Bruno's NY Brick Oven Pizza,Bruno's NY Brick Oven Pizza,Brun0's NY Brick Oven Pizza,3.0

"Let me start by saying we have been here many times prior and have always loved it. But never again we will go here & we warm you to do the same. WANT TO SPEAK TO THE OWNERS OF THIS BUSINESS SOON AS POSSIBLE!!!! Your employees ""Jacob"" and ""Katie"" who were working today Sunday 21,2018 are the MOST UNBELIEVABLY RUDE PEOPLE we have EVER dealt with. We purchased two tuna sandwiches with cheese, chips, salsa, coffee ground, a candy, 2 onions and 2 root beers today. When we got home, we realized that the two sandwiches did not have cheese like we asked, not such a big deal. My husband called to let them know of their mistake, Jacob said ""oh sorry."" Then hung up. My husband then called back, obviously upset at the business your store delivers now, and then after questioned, Jacob said we could come down there and he would throw a piece of cheese on them. So unbelievably rude yet again. We are business owners ourselves and this is NOT how you do business. At this point, we were flabbergasted as how disgusting your service was and have been there times before where this has never happened. I called back and spoke to Katy, who was also EXTREMELY RUDE, screaming over me questioning me what cheese we had, which was not the point, refusing us to tell us your names or how to reach a manager. Katy then hung up on me when I said we were coming back to return everything. I called back and they ignored our calls twice. I called from my cell instead of husbands & was answered right away. Katy proceeded to tell me she has spoken to a manager and that no one would be returning our items because we were not given a receipt even though we had been there LITERALLY 5 minutes prior and just arrived home. She also would not answer why they kept hanging up on us. We never cursed, never threatened. She said we could come back some time during the week and get a ""credit for the sandwiches."" We want our money back and to never ever do business with you again. We will make sure everyone in Seminole Heights knows how you truly treat customers, the second they are unhappy with an experience.

"Absolutely worst experience ever, ever, ever!!!!! All I wanted was a good cup of fro-yo and instead I got a horrible experience. There were only 2 flavors, a tart original that had a very gritty consistency and a chocolate flavor that was just as tart and gritty. Not good. Their saving grace (so I thought) were the fresh fruit topping options. That is until the teenage/twenty-something cashier went from handling money and talking on the phone to grabbing toppings from the bar with his BARE HANDS and popped them in his mouth. Disgusting. That is pretty much when I swore this place off forever. Oh but it gets better...

So I paid for our two frozen yogurts with my credit card and left a tip on the bill. A few weeks later when I received my credit card statement, the place charged me $10 more by adding a simple ""1"" in front of my tip. My two cups of kid-size frozen yogurts cost me $18 instead of $8!

"The store is right next-door to the Noble Rice restaurant on Platt Street. There's a small parking lot behind it.  They sell Japanese themed foods here which include some Japanese style sandwiches that are also popular on the West Coast US.  I was told that the bread they use for the sandwiches are fresh baked. I ended up getting the egg salad sando and their chicken katsu sando. Between the two, my favorite was the chicken katsu sando.

They also sell non-perishable Japanese groceries. Since I'm not here during the day time, I can't really speak for their poke bowls, but I heard they were good.  

I'm going to be honest, a lot of the stuff that they sell in the grocery portion of this place, you can get at any Oriental market. Though I'm sure these are good, a lot of their refrigerated items were way more expensive than I'm willing to purchase. 

I purchased and tried their Ramen kit (ramen, toppings, and crab miso ramen base) and found it very underwhelming. Ended up adding ebi fume furikake (Purchased elsewhere) to give it a little bit more flavor.  It was aight. The crab base didn't taste like crab at all.

"This restaurant in located inside Embassy Suites. Should be no stars. We had been flying all day from West coast didn't want to get in car to find a place to eat in University research area.

 The hostess sat us close to the open kitchen (which I enjoyed since I have a catering company & love to cook) with no menus & told us the waitress (who we soon discovered was the only one on duty) was very busy delivering room service & would take our order when she returned to dining room. The only other guests in dining room were 3 women seated at the same table. 

We sat for 15 minutes before the waitress came back. She gave us menus and water then stated she had another room service delivery & would be back to take our order. The poor girl ran to the kitchen counter picked up and delivered the meals that we could see sitting under heat lamps for the table with the 3 women. She ran back picked up several more room service meals put on a cart & headed to elevators. One of the only two elevators was not in use & filled with equipment during our 3 night stay. 

Mean while the hostess sat at a table near the entrance or stood by the open kitchen talking to the three cooks who were very busy. She was not doing a thing to help the waitress or us. 

Before our waitress returned the hostess sat an elderly couple. The waitress returned in 12 minutes gave them menus & water & took their order & turned it in. She then came to take our order. We felt bad for her, she was very pleasant & apologetic and exhausted. We didn't complain about how long we had been waiting or that she took care of the elderly couple first. 

She made several more room service deliveries. The elderly couple as well as our food sat under heat lamps. Our side salads were delivered the same time she brought our meals 25 minutes after we ordered. 

Our meal was not hot when it was delivered fish was dry and over cooked along with the veggies. Salads were warm. She delivered our bill when she set our meals down told us if we were staying @ hotel to charge it to our room. And ran back to pick up more room service orders. We had been in dining room an hour by the time our meal arrived.

We finished what we could of the over cooked dried out meal & headed to our room. Our water was never refilled & we were not asked if we needed anything or how our meal was. 

We decided to we should have left the dining room went back to our room & ordered room service. We would have been eating sooner & food would have been hot. 

I'm not sure why the dining room pays for a useless hostess. Maybe no one has reported her. The poor waitress wasn't in dining room long enough to know hostess wasn't helping out.

"After seeing so many great photos on Yelp I figured I'd give this pizzeria a try, but boy did I make a mistake. I went on their website and called in to order their daily special: 2 large pizzas, 12 wings, order of fries, and 2 liter $21.95. I got it delivered about an hour later and my pizza was already cold, 
Meanwhile, I live on the same street as this restaurant...I payed $1.50 to add pepperoni on 1 pizza got maybe 6 slices on the whole pizza. The website menu prices are wrong, I let the person I was speaking to know the prices are lower on their website but he didn't seem to care. I asked for marinara on the side, which I also had to pay extra for, but decided not to buy. (All pizzerias give you sauce on the side for your pizza if you ask.) I guess they did not like that I didn't purchase their sauce because I had absolutely no sauce on my pizzas! They gave me a flatbread instead...plastic tasting cheese, greasy wings. Some advice if you are in the Egypt Lake area, save yourself the hassle and some money by getting yourself a $5 pizza or $12 deep dish from Caesars down the street, it is literally so much better than what I got 1 hour and 30 bucks later.

"Took my wife and friend here. It had a pleasant atmosphere, quiet with televisions on the walls. 

The service was terrible at first and it was better at the end. We first walked in and sat ourselves. Someone immediately dropped off menus without saying hello or anything. They put the menu down and quickly turned away without a word or greeting even though my wife said hello to them and said ""this is our first time here"" trying to spark a conversation. Very rude. 

Our waiter was better but we could not hear him as he was really soft spoken. He was nice and very attentive to our table. 

As for the food, my wife and friend enjoyed their food. I did not care for my chicken quesadilla as it did not taste good and very messy. The Mexican beans looked disgusting. It was a brown paste soup with melted white cheese on top. My friend made a comment that it looked like Sh*t with Cum on top. 

The food was not cheap. For two meals, it came out to $42.

I proceeded in turning around and heading back to the restaurant, after confronting the drive thru person who had made and handed me the drink she chuckled a little and told another manager who acted as if she didn't care and proceeded to go to the back and get another manager acting as if I wasn't standing there . Before walking into the store I made sure I gathered myself and wasn't completely irate. But the level of seriousness and professionalism only lead me to believe things like this happened all the time. Shortly after a woman who I believe is the general manager came out to do an incident report on was instructed that I will get a call back within 48 hrs.

"BJ's Alabama BBQ is served out of a refurbished drive-through fast-food place, located on South Dale Mabry in between El Prado and Bay to Bay. The restaurant is small with a large counter area, open-air kitchen & smoker, and a few tables - both inside and out. 

The intoxicating scent of wood smoke hits you as soon as you get out of your car, and when you step inside you'll see their open-air smoker and grill with all of that delicious BBQ goodness just waiting for you.

You'll find the menu posted on the wall advertising ribs, chicken, beef, pork, sausage and combo meals, along with plenty of sides. You can either eat everything there, or take it home for later.

For my lunch I ordered a two-meat combo with ribs and smoked sausage, and added potato salad and collard greens for my two sides. I'm not a huge fan of the overly-sweet Alabama-style BBQ sauce (lots of molasses and honey), but the food was excellent. The ribs were fall-off-the-bone tasty, and the collard greens had been stewing in their pot liquor all afternoon. The smoked sausage had a very nice mix of seasonings, and the flavor was enhanced by its time spent inside the smoker.

Don't show up in a shirt & tie, or you'll be wearing BBQ sauce for the rest of the day. BJ's is the kind of very casual place where you roll up your sleeves and get elbow-deep into the sauce. They do have a unisex bathroom so you can wash your grubby paws when you're all done eating. May I suggest a bib and a lot of paper towels if you eat ribs they way that I do!

This is a real basic, locally-owned and operated BBQ joint in South Tampa, and the ladies working there have every right to feel proud about their food. Very tasty, and not very expensive. Give them a try!",4,A,BJ's Alabama BBQ,BJ's Alabama BBQ,BJ's Al@b@m@ BBQ,4.0

"If you like working Air Conditioning, quiet/clean rooms and quality customer service I suggest you run away from this hotel as fast as you possibly can. Let me start off by saying I'm really not picky when it comes to hotels. Give me a somewhere to park, nice cold AC and a bed to sleep on that isn't rock hard and I'm good to go. Upon arrival I parked in a garage for free and got in my room with a comfortable king size bed; good start but it was pretty much all downhill from there. My girlfriend and I left the room pretty much immediately to go out for dinner and drinks. Before we left I noticed the room was a bit warm so I cranked the AC down so it would be cold when we got back... something I do pretty much every time I get into a hotel room. When we got back I passed out almost immediately from the combination of a long day/drive and a few drinks. The real nightmare began at 5:30am when I woke up sweating. Even though the thermostat was set to 70 the room temperature was 80 degrees! I would have asked for a new room immediately but my girlfriend was still sleeping so I tried to lay on top of the bedding and relax. As I'm laying there I hear a noise that was reminiscent of an air conditioning unit turning on, running for a bit, turning off and repeat. Only thing was the noise wasn't happening consistently, sometimes it was every 5 seconds others it would go away for 30 and come back. It was driving me CRAZY! After over an hour laying awake in bed, I take to the internet on my phone to start looking at reviews and see if there are others complaining about similar things. I came across a couple talking about how noisy the elevators were, sure enough I look outside my window and right next to my room is the elevator... half of the rooms are facing inside an atrium looking directly across to office buildings which is very odd but that didn't really bother me because as I said before I am typically very easy to please with hotel rooms. Once I figure out I'm not imagining things and it was the elevator making noise I go down and request to be changed rooms for the following day. Other than having to pack up our things and move up a floor getting changed rooms was a pretty painless process. Get in the new room and it is HOT, chalk it up to AC being up high and turn it down and we go out around Tampa for the day and early evening. Even though I turned the AC down to 65 we came back and the room is 79 degrees! I'm sorry but my house is 74 degrees and thats because I am paying for it I want my hotel room to be COLD, I'm not going to have 3 more poor nights sleep.... time to change hotels. I explained my situation to the front desk and they told me that they can't help me with any sort of refund because it was booked through a third party. Okay whatever I understand and get Orbitz on the phone, waited 30 minutes and eventually went down to the front desk again where myself, Orbitz and Intercontinental Tampa manager discussed the cancellation and refund. All parties agreed I would only be charged for the first night. Only thing is the hotel needed to receive a fax confirming this from Orbitz. I waited on the line for 20 minutes by the front desk then asked the manager if we would still be okay for the refund if she didn't receive the fax (can I hang up the phone) as I wanted to start packing. The manager said yes which is actually frustrating because if she didn't need that fax that means she could have helped me without contacting Orbitz to begin with they just wanted to avoid a cancellation and refund. So I hang up the phone, pack the car in the garage, pull the car around and come in to get confirmation. The manager has received the fax and is refusing to give me a copy. The claim is that there is confidential information on the fax. I said thats fine, white or scribble over whatever is confidential and give me a copy and STILL REFUSES. She offers me a folio showing I had a zero balance with the hotel which does me absolutely nothing, I booked through Orbitz, I would have had a zero balance with the hotel even if I stayed there the full day. All I wanted was some sort of confirmation that the hotel and Orbitz agreed to refund the 3 days that I stayed, even if it was basic notes on the folio or something on company letter head. I only wanted this so I can provide it to my bank if I had to make a credit card dispute. The hotel refused this request for reasons beyond anything I can comprehend. 
Also as we were leaving my girlfriend notice a dry bloodspot on the sheets, Gross! If you look at the picture it was right at the top corner of the bed, I don't know how someone could miss this. 

So one last time, do not stay at this hotel. Literally worst experience I have ever had with any business, ever.

"I am shocked that this Downtown gem has only 2 stars on Yelp.  Granted, I can't comment on the namesake hot dogs as they are always a disgusting way to serve unwanted animal parts but as for the rest of the menu, step aside Yelpers, this place is 5 stars.

There wasn't a separate Yelp entry for the Tampa Salad part of the store but I'm assuming they both equal Nathan's Hot Dogs.  I tried something from each so here ya go.

Tampa Salad CO.- For $6.99 you get the salad of your dreams.  It works like a Subway with a base lettuce, then all of the toppings your little heart desires, no restrictions.  And there are so many options.  I didn't get a protein or a cheese which is included  (grilled chicken, fried chicken, blue cheese, feta, cheddar, etc...) but I definitely felt I got my money's worth with a filling salad loaded up with spinach, peppers, broccoli, tomatoes, carrots, olives, celery, fried onions, and a delicious vinaigrette ( there are probably 40 choices of dressing......).  And while the salad bar was making me swoon, there is an extra star up there for what comes with your salad for free.  A fantastically sized soft pretzel roll.  I expected a pretzel stick and was stunned to see the warm pretzel roll slide into my bag.  Holy smokes, this is my new favorite place.

Nathan's- The only food item I got from the Nathan's half of the store were some french fries which were delicious.  I heard so much about them from others in my office that I had to grab a small order to take back.  They were every bit as delicious as I'd heard they were and glad I sacrificed the $3 to make them mine.",34,C,Nathan's Famous Hot Dogs,Nathan's Famous Hot Dogs,Nathan's Famous Hot Dogs Inc.,5.0

"I will admit in advance that I will always have a soft place in my heart for Bern's because we came here the night we got engaged, a little over a year ago.

This place is fantastic.  Between the Farm to Table practice and the extensive and very reasonably priced wine list, the experience is a dream.  Sure, the place is decorated like Disney's Haunted Castle and it's a nightmare actually getting a table, but the food is wonderful.  And the service!

"**2.5 STARS** because it was an overall okay experience, but rounded down because I expected more

Came to this place with an old high school friend to see what the hype was about. The Fresh Kitchen chain almost has like a cult following. Every time I mention it, I have friends who say ""yeah my one friend goes there ALL the time!"" So I was like, okay it must be good. 

I also want to say, I really support the whole idea of FK and the idea of clean food, as well as their donation campaign during pride month where they asked for donations for Equality Florida Institute's Safe and Healthy Schools Project. I'm all for that, their store decor is pink and poppin' (really nice houseplants, I saw), their Instagram feels like a safe space with diverse staff and good vibes in general. I LOVE that energy and am a big fan. 

However. My food experience was just not optimal. I got the six bowl with an added protein of steak which, rounded up for donations, made it a $12 meal. Like okk, fine so far. Not my ideal price (especially because I can get a custom made pizza from Blaze or Mod for a cheaper price and larger portion), but I'll take it because it's supposed to be FRESH and with reliable ingredients. I got the sweet potato noodles at the recommendation of the boy over the counter, sesame green beans because it was in high demand, according to IG, herb grilled steak, and the herb balsamic vinaigrette (I think. Tbh I forgot the sauce because it didn't really wow me.) While the ingredients looked really ugly in the picture, the combination was not too bad. I mean, it's stuff I can definitely cook at home, probably at a cheaper per unit price, and more to my taste (for example, I like my green beans cooked a bit more than what they did, which was crunchy. When I make Chinese green beans they become really tender and juicy, which is to my liking. I mean despite using sesame seeds, this is def more Asian-inspired than an Asian side dish.), but you're paying for the quick delivery of the food and not having to cook. So I was like alright. 

For a ""fresh kitchen"" though, my food was pretty cold/lukewarm temperature on all fronts and not exactly filling. I originally got around 4 pieces of steak (for a $2 upcharge?! Y'all...) and when I asked the server for more, he looked at me funny/like I was weird and added 2 more pieces. Y'all telling me I paid +$2 for 6 bites of steak?? I can get more meat than that from Chipotle and have it taste better. So then you get into the argument, Fresh Kitchen's marketing CLEARLY makes it more clean/fresh/etc than somewhere like Chipotle, but at what cost?? Literally, what cost? It don't taste as good for the price and I for one don't know if the meat they're using is organic/non-GMO/grass-fed/sustainably sources/all the jazz. Like if I REALLY wanted a fresh kitchen, I would have just sucked it up, bought some grass fed beef from the neighboring Sprouts in the plaza, and took 10 min to cook it myself. At least I would have gotten more than 6 bites. 

Furthermore, when I told the server I wanted more meat because he was literally giving me the last vestiges of steak in the serving container, he was like ""What do you mean old? This steak came out 5 minutes ago!"" That's super funny because I was waiting in line for 5+ minutes, watching them serve, and I didn't see an extra portion of steak come out from the back kitchen. Obviously you don't have to trust my eye witness statement as those can be unreliable, but the fact that he said that while refusing to give me the last of the cold steak at the very bottom of the container... Bye boy. Maybe your dedication to the company is very very deep for defending them like that, but I saw you pick meat ONE BY ONE with your tongs to add to my bowl, even before I asked. That is the CHEAPEST portion I've ever received, and I've visited my fair share of bowl restaurants. 

Alright so let's recap: great mission/values but something just didn't reflect with my experience of mediocre food and cheap service. I know the employees are on the younger side, which usually I would be okay with, but that interaction made me never want to support this place again. I guess it's alright because like I said, FK has an almost cult-like following (especially all the old white people in front of me in line paying $30+ for their meal of 2 portions, lmao), but they can support this place with such a great cause. Not I.",34,C,Fresh Kitchen New Tampa,Fresh Kitchen New Tampa,fresh kitchen new tampa,2.0

"LZL is a new restaurant occupying the former Sate Asian grill (2012) and Pizzafire (2017) spots in the brick University plaza which has First Watch, 5 Guys, Taj Indian Cuisine, and Winn Dixie.

When you enter , there is a bar/partition barely 1 ft from the door that splits the dining area into 1/3 and 2/3. The furniture has Chinese art and a dark mocha color scheme. I was under the impression that it was a fast casual place but was surprised that they had table service. I was seated in a booth on the 1/3 side and given tap water without asking. After looking at Rachel's review, I went with the no. 1 Lanzhou Beef Noodles. You can choose regular, thick, or hand tossed, though its not too apparent (There are commas between each choice on the menu. I would have written something like ""Choose between the following noodle types and then list the choices)

When I received the dish, my brain essentially thought ""This is Chinese pho"" There are noodles, cilantro, and thin beef slices  in a translucent broth. The broth is decent but not memorable. The cilantro had no smell. There were only 2-3 small pieces of beef. The best part were the actual noodles  themselves. Different from the vermicelli style pho , they were thicker and had a more robust taste. On the table , they had  a hot sauce in ceramic china. I added some of it to the dish which made it 25 % better but even then I felt non plussed about the meal.

The service was a bit underwhelming. There were about 11 other patrons inside but my server never came to refill my water. Also , 13 minutes after finishing my meal, I kept looking back but the front desk woman was always looking at her terminal .  I saw the other female server walking around but not mine. Finally I went up and feigned ignorance about whether to pay upfront or if the check would be brought to me. The front lady printed a check and I gave her my card and high tailed it out of there.

If you're going to do table service for a small scale restaurant, make sure its on point. Also, give me metal forks , not a dinky plastic one. Giving me a nice soup spoon and china and a plastic fork is weird. Even Saigon Deli has metal silverware. In addition, charging $10 dollars and having almost no meat is unacceptable.

I had the fried chicken, okra, and black eye peas.  The chicken was crisp, juicy, and the seasonings spot on.  One of the best fried chickens I've had in a long time.  The okra was crunchy, lightly breaded, and tasty.  Definitely get an order if you like okra or want to try good okra.  The peas were tasty - especially after adding a splash of Zatarain's hot sauce.  Service was attentive and responsive.  What a treat to be visited by head matron Jacklyn.  She should be on the Ybor's Chamber of Commerce.

"This place is absolutely DELICIOUS. I have nothing bad to say about it.

My friend and I went the other day to try this out after a long day of shopping. The place itself is small, but what do you expect for a take-out/drive-thru only place. They also have seating in the place next door for those who want to eat nearby. 

Now, on to the food. We got a couple of things: Dragon berry Fruit Açaí Bowl, Peanut Butter Blast Smoothie, and the Voodoo Bowl Poke Bowl. In terms of food, my personal favorite was the Voodoo Bowl. It was so flavorful and appetizing. I especially loved the spicy mayo and blend of proteins. 

The Dragon berry bowl was always very good, not the best açaí bowl I've ever had, but definitely up there. As for the peanut butter blast smoothie - chocolate/peanut lovers, this is for you. The drink was so delicious, and definitely one of my favorite beverages out there.

The prices are rather decent. I would consider them worth it. The wait time can sometimes be a while, so be cautious if you are in the rush, but I figure it's because it's made fresh. 

Overall, this is my new favorite food place in Tampa. The employees are super nice, and the food is excellent. It's such a hidden gem, and so worth the drive. I highly recommend it to anyone.",4,A,Big Island Poke,Big Island Poke,Big Island Pok3,5.0

I came in for dinner to visit with my uncle, my 2 daughters and my little sister and her son (2 year old). The food was great, the Shitake pizza is a favorite of mine, and our server was kind and attentive. 
However, the issue came up when the manager asked to silence my nephew from occasionally kicking his feet on the booth. 
This is a Pizzeria, and a noisy, family one at that. My nephew was only kicking one in a while and I could barely hear it over the music and diner noise.

The quality of every ingredient and the preparation are always perfect.  You'll never get a bad cut of meat or anything but the freshest greens.

Try a bowl if it's your first order but you really can't go wrong - I indulged (for the first time) in some fries with my last order and true to form they were perfectly crispy and delicious.  They don't do anything here they can't do to perfection.

We loved everything we ordered: matcha green milk tea, oolong milk tea, and avocado and durian smoothie. They use fresh fruit which was so refreshing. And the milk teas were a perfect sweetness. They told us for the oolong milk tea, they use brown sugar. The boba was really soft and flavorful. They serve honey boba and it was cooked perfectly. A small bubble tea was $3.50 and small fresh fruit smoothie was $4.50, so I would say the price is just average. I am pleased because it was worth the quality.

"Why 5 stars? Because these are possibly the best pancakes in Tampa Bay.

   ---   ---   ---

I declared, ""these are the best pancakes in Tampa Bay!""

My wife then reminded me about Ohana Cafe in Dunedin.

""D'oh!""

It's so hard to choose which of the two I enjoyed more, because they are very different, as far as pancakes go. Ohana is a Hawaiian restaurant, that serves their pancakes with a slab of macadamia sauce spread across. It's pretty freaking epic.

But this isn't about Ohana, it's all about Shelly's!

Shelly's Pancakes come with the most fruit I've ever seen on pancakes. Strawberries, bananas, and blueberries are the culprits of this fruit invasion. Throw some powdered sugar on there, and BOOM, you've got at least the 2nd best pancakes around :) They didn't leave me feeling as sugar hungover as pancakes/waffles/french toast usually do, so I think they were a bit less heavy than usual pancakes, which only makes them more perfect.

This business took over for PAO Cafe, which makes me sad because I loved PAO, but I absolutely love the new tenant just as much, after only one visit. I'd love to try something else on the menu, but those pancakes were so heavenly, it's going to be hard to stray away from them. Maybe the Shelly's French Toast next time, with the same concoction of produce? :)

The wife ordered a pancake sandwich, which was different, but nearly equally as awesome. 

So if it's not apparent enough by now, go to Shelly's and get the pancakes.",9,A,Shelly's Cafe,Shelly's Cafe,Shelly's C@fe,5.0

"I put off writing this review in the hopes that letting some time pass after my brunch there might temper my reaction.  Unfortunately that wasn't the case.  I'd like preface this by saying that writing a bad reviews is the exact opposite reason that I joined Yelp.  However, this was quite possible the worst brunch I've ever had.

I will start with the positives.  The coffee is really good.  Our server was knowledgeable and courteous; always around when we needed her to fill up water glasses and top off the coffee.  The space is decorated beautifully and the atmosphere is fantastic inside.  The sidewalk seating is perfect for a fall morning in Ybro.  We were seated promptly and the food did come out of the kitchen pretty quickly.  Unfortunately, that is when our experience at Sunday's (on a Sunday morning) took a 180 degree turn for the negative.

We both ordered omelets, and maybe that was our big mistake.  The home fries were soggy and luke-warm, as if they'd been cooked hours ago and left to sit in a hot drawer to be served at a later date.  They were also very bland, but thankfully not greasy.  The grits I ordered as my side were completely unseasoned and dry, and they may have been the most bland thing I've ever eaten.  And the omelet.  Oh my.  I ordered the smoked salmon & dill one with Havarti cheese.  It was giant and looked appealing as the plate was delivered, but failed to deliver.  It was very tough on the outside and steaming hot on the inside.  I suspect (although cannot confirm) that it may have been pre-prepared and then microwaved.  I have no clue how else they would have gotten it into the state it was in when I tried to eat it.  On top of that, there was hardly any cheese in or on it, and I didn't see or taste any dill.  Ultimately the toast and jam that was served on the side turned out to be the best part of our meal.

I hope that perhaps we came in on a bad day, where they were training someone new in the kitchen or the chef was just having a bad day.  Their dinner menu does look fantastic.  But after the disappointing brunch experience I'd be hard pressed to return.  Personally I feel like omelets may be one of the easiest food to prepare.  They are certainly the item that young chefs are taught to cut their teeth on.

"This place has lots of potential but I'm giving it four stars for its lack of vegetarian and vegan options. For people like me, who don't eat animals, these options are essential to compete with Bamboozle, which has a separate vegan menu. As a new establishment, it appears that there are a few kinks to work out. Tofu isn't even listed on the printed menu (hey, I know printing [and reprinting] is expensive), but upon visiting I noticed that they had tofu listed under the pho options. I went in for breakfast and asked if they had any vegan options. The girl at the counter seemed a bit confused and turned to (what appeared to be) a more senior member of the staff, who was working off to the side, for help with my request. He suggested a tofu banh mi (which is on the menu but is made with eggs). I added avocado to my order, and the sandwich was excellent. In addition, the coffee was outstanding. I didn't experience any delays with my order that other reviewers experienced, but there were only two other people in there at the time.
The shop is ideally situated downtown, and the atmosphere is warm and inviting. There are plenty of seating options including a leather sofa and arm chairs, stools at a window counter, as well as traditional tables and chairs. The background music was subtle and suitable, and even included a Grateful Dead tune while I was there. Free Wifi makes this an appealing place just for coffee or tea.
This place seems poised to be able to cater to vegans and vegetarian with the existing menu. There are two spring rolls that appear to be animal-free and the bun or rice bowl (with tofu as the protein) could be a viable option. For those whose diets are in the minority, a few designations on the menu would go a long way to attracting this crowd.

Hands down for the money, my favorite food they offer is oddly a cheese steak sandwich, which I will not begin to claim is authentic in any way but it's absolutely perfect for me.

"My family loves Grillsmith! Carrollwood is our go-to location since both restaurants on the south side of town have closed in recent years. IMO South Dale Mabry was the best and most convenient for all family members, we were sad to see it go. Grillsmith is always a consistent dining experience from attentive servers to the quality and taste of the meal.  

We love to start with the Spicy Thai Shrimp, which has a tender crunchy coating and delicious dipping sauce, and one of their flatbreads loaded with yummy toppings. I've heard the Voodoo Shrimp is also great but I can't break myself away from the Thai to try it.  Their complimentary bread sticks are also great. From there, my family loves every entree whether it be the Chicken Marsala, Chimichurri Steak, Pork Tenderloin, or Oak Barrel Salmon, each is prepared perfectly. They have ""Fitness Plates"" which are a lighter, smaller portion for those watching what they eat. My daughter is upset they removed the Lillian's Braised Beef from the menu though, it is still her favorite, but she has moved on and found two new favorites. I don't eat much meat so I enjoy the simple yet tasty Caribbean Black Bean burger with a nice cold House Salad for starters. This burger is not on their dinner menu, it is on the lunch menu, but they are always accommodating and fix it for me anyway. All of their sides are perfectly created from the amazing Au Gratin Potatoes to the Seasonal Veggie to the Sweet Potato fries I order to accompany my burger (with a side of BBQ sauce for dipping!). 

Along with the treat of a night out, we choose Grillsmith to be our #1 stop for celebrations from graduation to birthdays to engagements. There are two things I appreciate most about Grillsmith. First are the attentive servers, while not overbearing, are there to refill your drink before it runs dry. And second is hands down, a consistent dining experience. There has never been a single incident where a member of our party has needed to send food back to the kitchen. Every dish, every time, is perfectly cooked and seasoned, and is a perfect temperature when served.

Their prices are a bit on the higher end of what you would consider ""family casual"" but still extremely reasonable considering the quality and quantity of the food, service, and ambiance.

"Why 3 stars? Because it's nothing special for Brunch and basically a plain-Jane average experience that's reminiscent of Village Inn with its basic menu options and old school 90s decor. 

Samaria Cafe is located in downtown Tampa next to First Watch. We wanted to try something different and not much else was open so we gave Samaria Cafe a shot. Samaria Cafe has kind of an outdated interior decor that reminds me of a village inn restaurant. Just like village inn, the brunch menu options were pretty basic although they did have 4 different Benedict options. I was a little disappointed that the menu doesn't have a lot of seafood options. 

We ended up getting the mushroom Benedict and the Reuben with coleslaw. The server told us they're known for their Reuben and it did not disappoint. The mushroom Benedict came out a little runnier than expected, so if you like yours well cooked, make sure to specify that! Our food came out in under 10 minutes and there was no wait to be seated.

"On a scale from 0 to 5, a 0 being terrible and a 5 being excellent, the food is a 3. It is not the worst or the best food one can eat. It is good food with mild seasoning and nice size proportions. The food is inexpensive.
 The reason for my review is due to the poor customer service I received today. The last time I order from them was 8 months ago at my last job. At the old job their customer service was excellent. On a scale from 0 to 5, I would have given them a 4.5.

 Recently, I started a new job that is 8 to 10  minutes away from Great Eats. I decided to order from Great Eats today because I was happy with their service at my old job. But, after today's horrendous service, I have dropped their customer service score to a 1. 
My first 2 occasions I called the restaurant was yesterday, my calls were dropped twice , and I could never finish my order because I had go back to the phones. My third occasion (last occasion), I called the restaurant back at 10:40 am next day.The same lady answered the phone once more and asked me for my location. I proceed to give her the call center name and address. Once she received the address, she told me to hold and I could hear her say to someone in the background ""Can you take this call? It is the same lady calling again."" This was the third time I was treated like a difficult customer or in a passive aggressive manner. I was quite chipper and polite; however, the lady acted as if talking to me was a chore. I was never rude or a negative Nancy on the phone despite my two failed attempts to place my order.
The man quickly took over the call and informed me that to deliver I must order at minimum $20 worth of food before taxes and that the order would take two hours for the 2nd time.  I said it would be fine with me once more. 
Next, the man asked ""Why did you not return our call from yesterday?""
I explain to him how I did not have access to my phone because I was in a call center taking calls. I explained I saw the missed call and text message five and half hours after I last spoke to the restaurant and by then their restaurant was closed. The man explained to me that per the Manager that they would not deliver any food to me at my work place because I failed to answer their text message in a timely manner. Therefore, they couldn't trust me to answer my phone when the delivery man arrived because he would have to call me to let me know he was out in the lobby. The man said that I could still place the order, and the food would be ready in 2 hours, but I would have to drive and pick it up. He would still take my order and card payment over the phone as well. I told them I understood, and I would call back at a later time. 
I decided against calling them back. My friend brought me some food from her house and I ate the extra chili that she so kindly offered me.

BE WARNED:
If you are interested in their restaurant you will need to buy $20 worth of food before taxes if you want them to deliver any food to you. However, on their website it says $7 minimum for delivery for limited areas. My call center is 8 to 10 minutes away from them (2.5 miles). My old job was 15 to 20 minutes away from them, and they never behaved in this manner. They were fine delivering the food and getting the 20 % to 35% tip I gave the delivery man at my old job.
Also you will have to wait 2 hours to receive your food. It doesn't matter if they are delivering it to you or if you're picking up. It will be the same amount of time. So, you would need to call early to get you food finished in a timely manner.",28,C,Great Eats Sandwich Company,Great Eats Sandwich Company,Great Eats Sandwich C0mpany,1.0
"Fuji Sushi is greatest place to get Sushi in Tampa.

What can I say, it has a small and warm ambiance that you can't find at more commercial places.  Mr. Lee, the owner makes the sushi for you and takes pride in cultivating relationships with everyone that goes there. You will always find someone asking about him or his family, and that is how he loves it.  

In terms of food, he uses the most fresh fish possible by getting multiple orders a week.  The presentation and plating always keeps guests smiling and coming back for more.  His special rolls are found on the Fuji Sushi Special Sushi Menu, not just the white sheet you order on.

"I met up with a friend on a Saturday night to catch up and grab a few drinks while enjoying the Florida weather. 
The venue itself is very pretty. The seating options are great and it would be good for a party or two or twelve. 
The menu at the bar was limited and not very appealing to me personally. I ordered the edamame just to have something to snack on and it was fine but not special. 
I can't comment much on the drinks as I only ordered vodka sodas which are hard to screw up. I was very unimpressed with the service. There were two men working but it seemed like they were not allowed to make drinks so they just awkwardly stood around. There were also two female bartenders who were very chatty with each other and not paying close attention to their customers, myself included. 
The best part of the evening was the music. DeJohn had the best playlist for a laid back rooftop vibe and my friend and I kept commenting to each other how we liked this song or pulled our phone out to get the name and artist.

The Louisiana Dry Rub is Cajun spice with hint of garlic. It is very tasty. If you only can handle the medium spicy, this wings is very good fit for you. I like it because of the spiciness but the Dry Rub with Dry wing. I am not particularly like the wet wings. So this preparation is to my liking. 

The wing is crispy and have good kick of spicy taste. It is not sweaty spicy. It is also crispy. The phone order was accurate and the the promised pick up time is exact. The price is good with $0.80 per wing.",16,B,Wingstop,Wingstop,Wingst0p,4.0
"My husband and I waited for 20 minutes to get in.  No big deal really, other than a manager of some sort came out three different times to let his buddies cut right around those of us in line and go straight in!  What happened to ""first-come, first-served"" as is stated on their website!?!?  What came afterwards was even worse!  We got in, headed straight to the ONE bar they have and were immediately ignored by the first bartender.  He stared straight at us then turned around.  Second bartender, working nearby, said she would be right with us.  After about 15 minutes later (she was making a large drink for a group and didn't know how to make it, so had to keep going to the recipe book) and after TWO MORE bartenders looked at us and ignored us (even when I said, ""excuse me, can we just get two beers?""), I was losing my patience in addition to many other customers around me stating the same!  The female bartender then finished the large drink, started conversing with the group, then conversed with a friend of hers standing behind us.  I asked again, ""can we just get two beers""?  She gave me a ""go-to-hell"" look and stated, ""I told you, I would be right with you.  I only have two hands you know""!  WOW, what customer service!!!  At this point, we had probably been at the bar 20-25 minutes.  And that's when we left.  Aside from the ""manager"" and bartenders, the door staff and stair guy were extremely pleasant.

"I've driven pass this location several times seeing the sign boasting to be the ""Best Thai in Tampa."" That's a pretty lofty statement that begs people to wonder if it'll live up to its hype.

We met some friends for lunch giving them some options courtesy of Yelp. I love looking at my bookmarks and trying something new. Our friends picked Thai food so we ventured here. 

Once we parked in their private lot that has at most 8-10 spots, we entered the restaurant. The seating is pretty tight and close to each other so you can hear the conversations going on in other tables.

It seems that from the reviews, the lunch buffet is the way to go. The weekend prices are pretty pricey considering I can find the same items in other restaurants. This restaurant doesn't stand out from any other Thai restaurant that I've been to. 

One thing to note is that the dishes are spicy. I ordered my Yum Beef (salad) medium and it was spicy even for me. My boyfriend's Spicy Green Chicken Curry was just the right heat level for him which begs the question what ""Thai Spicy"" would taste like.

We ordered a starter of vegetarian spring rolls for the table which came out four sad looking rolls. It was fine but not outstanding. It was by no means a generous amount.

Overall, the meal was decent but the prices were pretty high for something average. I have plenty of Thai restaurants nearby that have lower prices so I probably won't venture all the way here next time.

This was the first time I had been here to eat dinner and not a work function. I was quite impressed with the speed of service that we received. I ordered a draft beer for my dinner, they had a few draft craft beers, which was cold and good. 

For an appetizer we ordered the Havana Short rib ""Spring Rolls"". There were very interesting. They were good, and the almond guava paste & Peruvian aioli were different. The best was the almond guava paste, the aioli was ok, but the dish could have used a little heat.

After the starter I ordered a small Cesar salad. Was not super impressed, the salad came out dry and could shave used a little more dressing. 

For my dinner I ordered  the Lollipop Pork chop. THIS WAS AMAZING! The portion was plenty big and the pork chop was juicy, flavorful and tasty. The description read ""lightly smoked, Old Smokey Tennessee ""apple pie moonshine"", served with ""house cured bacon truffle"" macaroni & cheese, Chef's veg"". THAT IS WHAT SOLD ME!

"First of all, this isn't BBQ. I tried to order the burnt ends, but they were out, but had brisket. I was told that they cooked the whole brisket, and didn't remove the points for the burnt ends, and that should have been the tipoff. I opted for the brisket instead and was disappointed at what was presented. First, there was absolutely no smoke ring on the meat. As well, there was no smoke aroma from the meat itself, making me wonder how they could call this BBQ. I forged on and took my first bite, sans sauce. In a word ""flavorless!"" There was absolutely nothing there! Sure, the meat was tender, but you could do this by placing a brisket in the oven for a few hours. The sauce was the only thing that added any flavor to the meat, and any good BBQ'er will tell you ""the meat should stand on its own.""

"Healthy and Environmentally friendly! This place is pretty awesome.  I'm a dedicated vegan and a sustainabilist (meaning I promote living on this earth in a sustainable way) and this place is setting the bar for other establishments to follow. It's a nice tranquil cafe serving a number of nutritious options, catering to vegans, vegetarians, and those with certain allergies. It's ideal for anyone that wants to relax, study, or socialize while enjoying healthy treats and beverages.They incorporate many different positive practices into their business model such as using eco-friendly products, recycling, and fair-trade products. And if that wasn't enough, they also go the extra mile of educating their customers on the nutritional value of their food items and the benefits of it. If I didn't live so far away (near USF) I would definitely come here more often.

Just to clarify some points about the bad reviews this cafe has received. Viitals is setup like any other cafe and small restaurant (Panera bread, pita's republic, Moes, etc), you get your order at the counter, you are not waited on. The tables are no more than 4ft from the counter so how lazy do you have to be to complain about the food not being brought to you? Second, everyone has their own preference when it comes to how certain foods should taste and feel. For example, in my opinion, no place or person will ever come close to making authentic Mexican dishes (Enchiladas for example) as good as the women in my family (I'm Mexican by the way). However, that doesn't mean I'm going to totally bash other places about their Mexican dishes even though I may find them extremely  lacking in comparison. To each their own, but let's try to give a fair review.",35,C,Viitals Specialty Bakery & Lifestyle Cafe,Viitals Specialty Bakery & Lifestyle Cafe,Viit@ls Speci@lty B@kery & Lifestyle C@fe,5.0
"I've been coming to this area for the past 16 years.  I've eaten in a lot of places and felt I had a good handle on the happening places.  So when my hostess said we had to eat here, I was a bit skeptical.  How wrong I was!

This is THE place!  No trip to Tampa is complete without a Cuban sandwich, so I was all over that.  But the deviled crab was highly recommended.  Add to it rice and beans, and all of a sudden there was more food than I could eat.  It was all wonderful!

The atmosphere here is just perfect.  Casual, one waits to order and then waits for his food.  We were handed a box with our food in it and then found a table outside.  We were soon joined by three Cuban octogenarians.  What fun!  They filled us in on some of the little known history that only long-time residents would know.  We were also provided a hand-written invitation to their social club.  we had an absolute blast here.

I will be back here the next time I visit Tampa.  This is one of those don't miss places to eat.  Woo hoo!",8,A,Brocato's Sandwich Shop,Brocato's Sandwich Shop,Broc@to's S@ndwich Shop,5.0

I proceded to order white rice, shredded meat, and they had nothing else I wanted, I guess they had ran out of items, so I left it at that.  The lady who served me was nice and very generous with the portions she gave me, while another lady was standing a few steps away engaged on her smart phone. The one lady who served me asked the other lady how much would that be for those two items, and she replied, $10.99 + tax, I was suprised as well as the lady serving me, to which she said, ""but he's only taking rice and meat"" they other lady replied, ""same price""  I found it very expensive for 3/4 of the recipient full of rice.  I paid and left.  I was not feeling like looking like a cheapskate!  Too bad my first experience was this bad, the prices for ready made food was high in comparison with other markets.

"I enjoyed everything about our experience at Ichicoro Imoto.  They promote this location as ""a streamlined expression of Ichicoro's signature style ramen-ya"", but since I go to Ichicoro just for the ramen, that was okay by me.

Even though we were there on a busy Friday night, we were quickly sat at the counter that runs across the front of the restaurant. After a few minutes wait, our server brought my Kirin Light out, and took our order. I ordered the Shoyu ramen, and Jon tried the Shio ramen.  Both were generous portions, and had excellent flavor, although they were a bit salty. Pork and noodles were perfectly cooked. I always get the Shoyu ramen when I go to Ichicoro, and it tasted exactly the same to me.

My only complaint is that they have coupons (which are usually a great deal) in their shop for customers to use but sometimes they don't put them out and since they expire every month, I can't count on using them.

The service was so slow that we finished our margaritas and ate all of our chips and salsa before she even came by to take our order.

"Went here last week for lunch before heading to work & was glad I did! All of the staff is extremely friendly and quickly took my order when I entered. I ordered a ground beef & a chicken, broccoli & cheese empanada along with steak fries. 

Service was slow because it was crowded and they make your empanadas fresh & made-to-order. However, it took around 12-15 minutes to get my meal. Server was very helpful in bringing me utensils, hot sauce & ketchup.

Since these empanadas are made-to-order, they are extremely hot when you receive them. Both of the empanadas were extremely delicious. Personally, I liked the ground beef one a little more because it was very well seasoned and had a kick to it. They both tasted amazing with the hot sauce & the the crust of the pastry was perfectly crispy and golden brown. The steak fries adequately salted and tasted good.

"I have visited the original Davis Islands location and the recently opened South Tampa outpost on El Prado and have had terrific food and service at both.

Everything about this place feels authentic from the very personal, and personable, service to the insanely delicious pastas, sauces and mozzarella.

A friend I was dining with at the El Prado site had been there just the night before and was planning to return for a third consecutive night the day after we ate. It was just a fluke that the first night she was taken there as a spur of the moment decision with her dining companion. Our visit had been planned for a week because we were anxious to try it and a birthday dinner was in order for one member of our party. And the three-peat? Completely her idea as a way to introduce someone else to the restaurant for the first time.

We were given a small plate with olives, roasted veggies, small toasted breads brushed with olive oil and a couple of samples of pasta. Nice touch, selection and presentation. The entrees that were selected were preceded by a delightful but simple salad that provided a satisfying crunch and was accompanied by some tangy dressing.

Our pastas arrived quickly and proved to be very generous servings. The smells from each selection were incredible and the conversation definitely slowed as we went about the serious task of eating.

There was so much flavor we did not want to waste a bite so used the serving of bread that was placed on the plate to carefully soak up sauce and forks to thoroughly scrape each dish clean to capture every morsel as we packed up the uneaten portion for leftovers.

The server was quite helpful and was able to handle some special requests made due to dietary preferences. Note, we were charged a $5 for fee the substitutions requested (just think that should have been mentioned up front rather then showing up on a bill as a charge for marinara).

At the time of our late October visit the new location was still waiting for paperwork to clear so it could sell and serve wine. Until then, guests may bring their own (but may want to check to see if there is a corkage fee).

Some people might be a little put off by the prices but for the quality and quantity of what I was served I have no issue with the cost.

She was so rude and unpleasant. Also their menu is a lot smaller and so is the new place. Never going back,34,C,The Enerjuicer,The Enerjuicer,the enerjuicer,1.0
"Best meal I've had in Tampa Bay. This place could stand with the best restaurants in NYC or San Francisco. Service was excellent (they folded my napkin when I left the table for the bathroom). Ambiance, decor perfect for a sexy romantic date. And both dishes served were delicious. My pork chop was the most tender pork chop I've ever eaten.

"Why 4 stars? Because we've found a rare good Mexican restaurant in Tampa!

   ---   ---   ---
Early on in my days as a Tampite/Tampanian, I discovered Miguel's and absolutely loved it. I've yet to eat at a single other Mexican restaurant that I ""loved"" ever since. My visit to El Rincon officially changed that.

After driving by this place hundreds of times, I took the advice of the wise Mike S, whose review indicated that this is his favorite Mexican in the area. 

Mike S doesn't let people down, it's just not in his DNA. And apparently, it's not in El Rincon's either.

My only complaint is that my quesadilla seemed like it was half the size that it should have been. However, it was tasty enough that I wasn't too concerned about its size. The rice and beans are very crucial to me when I'm eating south of the border, and those bad boys delivered.

El Rincon, I will definitely visit again...and I see the potential for a 5-star update.",10,A,El Rincon Mexicano,El Rincon Mexicano,El Rincon Mexic@no,4.0

So, I cant comment on the accuracy of the food at 4 rivers, only my opinion of the taste.

Over the last few months, there seems to be an onslaught of people rushing to 4Rivers, and porklaiming (not a typo) it the next coming of Monica Bellucci.

I have never eaten at a Barbecue restaurant in Tampa. Outside of my mom preparing some occasionally at home, I dont really eat any Q

4 Rivers is located in a plaza with Youfit Fitness and Devita Dialysis (an ominous portent about my triglycerides perhaps?) on Dale Mabry  just south of the Bearss intersection.

The decor is sort of contemporary cafeteria with some neat 2 bladed fans with pulleys. There are metallic chairs along long wooden tables. I came at a light time on a weekday afternoon This is probably only the second restaurant that has a very communal feeling;you will be in kissing distance with your dining compeers on busy weekends.   Perpendicular to the main line for ordering is a ""Sweet Shop"" with oodles of confections.    I admit that I dont really think sweets when thinking of meat, but an interesting idea nonetheless.

Reading many reviews, I decided to order Burnt Ends dinner plate with some Texas Sausage a la carte, and smoked Jalapenos, Smokehouse Corn, Bread pudding, and a biscuit as sides.

My thoughts:

Burnt Ends:  Holy Hippo Spit!   This was excellent. It is a mix of brisket and pork burnt yet soft. Sweet yet spicy. I was inhaling it into my mouth like Kim Kardashian does on any night of the week. It becomes ""Shin Akuma"" levels of brokenness if you add 4 Rivers sweet/spicy sauce.    5/5

Texas Sausage: .  This was smoky and spicy and had was very good. Add the 4rivers sauce for more decadence       4/5

Corn: Probably the best corn that was not on the cob I have ever eaten in my life.
I could probably eat this by itself with out any other items    5/5

Smoked Jalapenos:   Hotter than I was thinking. The jalapeno has cream cheese and is wrapped tightly with bacon. Spicy and epic. Bonus: It looks like a Star Wars space ship.                                                 5/5

Biscuit:  Imagine a KFC/Popeye's biscuit, but supercharged with NOS. Big, flaky and filling                                                    4/5

Bread pudding:  This is basically a dessert , but prepared very nicely.  4.5/5


I would like to try the pulled pork and brisket in the future.
The rating teeters towards 4.5. I suppose if you just get the burnt ends/corn/jalapenos, consider my review a 5/5.

The only real negatives are: 

-- 4Rivers is closed on Sundays and it closes early weekdays at 8 pm.

--Even though it is a casual place, the prices are a bit expensive.
I would consider it equal to going to a sit down American chain a la TGI,Red Lobster, etc. 


Also, it is nice that the North Tampa is getting some good restaurants since it is somewhat of a ghost town up here and I don't want to drive to Palma Ceia for good food all the time.

"Let me just start this review by saying that if my review was going to be solely based on the drinks, bartender, or waitstaff service it would absolutely be five stars. I went there last weekend with my boyfriend for a date night and we were first off very impressed by the restaurant itself, it was very cute and clean, and we really liked the simple decor. 

When it came time to order our drinks our waiter was so friendly, and when I ordered a drink that they didn't have on the menu he went to the bar to see if they could make it, a peach Bellini. They didn't have it on the menu but the bartender made a peach purée and made the drink for me, it was absolutely delicious. 

The food on the menu looked extremely exciting, and we couldn't decide what to order because it all looks so good. I decided to go with the chicken and waffles, and my boyfriend got the ribs. When the food came the presentation was very nice, but the flavor just wasn't quite there. It was really disappointing considering how amazing our service was, and how amazing the drinks from the bar were. If they could get their food to be on the same page as their service and their bartender, they would definitely get five stars in my book.

I definitely see us going back here for a date night, but probably just for some drinks.",11,A,Cask Social Kitchen,Cask Social Kitchen,cask social kitchen,4.0
"I nornally don't go to MCD/BK unless I am going on a road trip to Miami or ATL. However, there were 2 items I was interested in trying.

This BK is one of the newer style ones from 2016. The restaurant was clean and the customer service was friendly. I got my order within 5 minutes. There is an electronic soda machine , but it was out of many flavors .

Impossible Whopper - This burger costs $5.50 (I believe a standard whopper is $4.30). It is made of soy and potato oil/sunflower oil. No meat is present at all. It has lettuce/pickles/tomato/ketchup like a standard whopper. It tastes pretty close to the whopper but not quite. I have to give Impossible food credit for that. The closest thing I feel  the taste is similar to is Boca Burgers from Publix/Walmart. It doesn't feel as substantial as a regular burger though. Nutrition wise, it is mostly the same with it being 30 calories less and 1 gram of sugar more and 1 gram of fat less or thereabouts. So overall, one shouldn't be eating this to eat healthy or lose weight. The carbon foot print /environment is the greatest benefactor.  I would recommend this for people who don't beef for religious reasons who are in a crunch with limited options.   3.25/5

BK Taco - I can't believe I'm saying this but this makes a Taco Bell standard taco look like Salma Hayek.  The taco shell is crisp but only at the top near the opening and the bottom is soft and shriveled up. The ""beef"" is some amorphous compound that is worse than TB beef. It has cheese and lettuce but is minimal. Not worth the $1.    2/5",26,B,Burger King,Burger King,BurgerKing,3.0

On the buffet today:

Naan. Disappointing. Cold in the steam table. Boooo. Please get this staple right.
Veggie korma. Good, but not great. I prefer it smoother and creamier.
Saag. Also good, but unremarkable.
Rice. Tasty, fragrant and properly unclumpy.
Biryani. Delicious.
Butter chicken. I prefer this on the smoother, creamier side, as well, but the flavor was good and the chicken tender.
Chicken vindaloo. Yummy. Hot, but not nuclear.
Goat curry. This is the stuff. Delicious brown curry sauce, tender goat and not too many palate-piercing bones.
Chicken tandoori. Flavorful, but a tad dry. Not unexpected for white meat on a buffet post-rush.

Service was friendly, used plates were removed during my visits to the buffet, and the dining room was clean and well-appointed. I will more than likely visit again for the regular dinner menu.

Having this place now a mile off is just wonderful. 

My last visit - I goofed and over ordered. I got the large chopped salad. Yeah, only do that if you are feeding two. Or maybe 3. Its ginormous. This is actually the very first time I have ever had the chopped version (i was raised on the standard style) and, well - I'll probably only ever order this version in the future. Pappas invented the potato salad on the bottom style salad, and they still do it just perfect.

Also added gyro meat - which is not recommended. Only reason for the 4 stars over what should be 5. It came out burnt on some edges, was a bit dry, and I was perplexed why it was on the side... I expected the protiens to be added to the salad. Gyro meat is great with sauce and/or veggies - kinda not so much alone. 

So, next visit: Small salad for one, or large salad for two. Maybe add chicken - gyro meat reserved for gyro plate or an actual gyro.",19,B,Louis Pappas Fresh Greek,Louis Pappas Fresh Greek,Louis Pappas Fr3sh Gr33k,4.0

"TL;DR - standard Hooters

FIrst and foremost, I LOVE the breaded wings at Hooters and its the main reason I come here. I swear!  It also helps that the ""scenery"" and ""decor"" is always nice at this particular location.

I've never had any major problems with the service here.  The girls are usually on top of things and food comes out quick.  Once in a while they'll forget something I asked for but it happens.   During non peak hours, they're usually just standing by the door greeting customers and are available to help if needed.  

My only gripe is that they could use more deals on food and drinks.  Wings, give or take, are about a dollar each regardless of how many you order.  Actually, pitchers aren't too bad at 7-8 bucks each. Wish they had a happy hour menu then I'd definitely be here everyday but I guess one can dream....

I got the rib sandwich with Mac and cheese and potato salad.  No lie, the potato salad was without a doubt the best I've ever had... Actually though, I was very impressed.  Mac and cheese was also excellent and went well with the bbq.  They make all their own sauce and it shows.  Full of flavor and I bet it took many years to get just right.

Must have been the grand opening as there was a DJ outside and 4 or 5 people dancing to music.  I placed a to go order for some chicken tenders.  I was quoted a wait time of 10-12 minutes.  What became immediately obvious is the kitchen was not up to speed yet.  I'd say most people waited at least 30-45 minutes for to go orders. It seemed that the kitchen could only handle one order at a time.  I heard one gentlemen comment that he thought he'd have to come back tomorrow to get his order.

After 50 minutes, I got my order and took the food home.  I'd say its not bad, but the service was so horrible that i will not go back.........",27,B,Wing Zone,Wing Zone,Wing Zone,1.0

I ordered a mango daiquiri instead which was very good. My friend ordered the media noche and said it was flavorless. The salmon burger was terrible, literally was like congealed spam and inedible.

"Honey's is half bar and half restaurant.  One of those Drinking-Family-Friendly places.  When I went at 9PM on a Saturday night, the restaurant section was filled with middle school aged cheerleaders and their parents.  The bar was pretty empty, I presume because the drinkers were mostly out front smoking.  There were plenty of big screen TVs (mostly tuned to the same game, unfortunately) and that online trivia game that some bars have.  There's also an arcade room. 

The menu is your basic pub fare: buffalo wings, pizza, salads, burgers and fries.  I went for the wings and I have to admit that they were some of the best wings that I've had in awhile.  Honey's fries tasted great too- fresh cut, but were served almost cold.  My husband- who's something of a pepperoni pizza snob- tried Honey's pizza and wasn't terribly impressed although he did manage to finish it.  But remember, he's a snob.  The bill wasn't bad either.  Very reasonable.

I don't have much to say about the service, but our waitress/bartender may have been having an off night.

At the end of the day- I may go again.  The wings were pretty F-ing good.  But then again, maybe I won't... There are plenty of other bars on Dale Mabry that will serve me cold fries and make me wait for my beer.",1,A,Honey's,Honey's,Honey's,3.0

"The ultimate retail store, brought to you by Sweden!

This place is madness - I suggest eating at their cafeteria before embarking on the epic journey through their shopping Mecca.  The meals are inexpensive and filling.  

Know going in: if you're purchasing furniture or large items, bring a friend and grab the palate cart instead of a grocery cart.  You'll need the friend to grab stuff from shelves at the end, and the cart won't cut it for heavy, bulky items.

They snake you around their store on purpose - it's an internal marketing scheme to force you through the various departments with the hopes of you purchasing items you otherwise weren't their for.  

Many kitchen items on the 1st floor are quite a bargain and you can really save some money if you shop wisely.  Some others appear inexpensive on the surface but a cursory Amazon search while in store will keep the prices true.

One of the best places for matted picture frames - perfect for the artist looking for an inexpensive way to frame their finished works.",4,A,IKEA,IKEA,IKEA,4.0
"Basically just left this establishment in horror. My sister and I love Thai food. In fact we have tried a bunch of them in Tampa and the two others in temple Terrace. We were excited about the proximity of this new place. The first disappointment came with the service. Slow and  unfriendly, our waiter handed us the menu and quickly walked away. Our first order was Thai coffee, which tasted very bitter, a stark departure from habitual drinks. Then came the beef salad, which flavors was different from standard. The salad was drizzled in what tasted like Italian salad dressing.  The peppered shrimp was ok. My sister did not like the beef Salad and had it sent back. We also canceled the rest of our order since the simple orders were already subpar. Shortly after doing so, the owner/cook came out and asked what happened. My sister explained that this is not what she is used to, and that the beef salad tasted like Italian salad dressing. The owner proceeded to say that this was her version and that she would have to charge for the salad. Neither of us had mentioned payment at this time. My sister was taken aback, and said that she wouldn't pay for something she didn't eat. The owner then said that she has to pay for rent, electricity and her groceries which were not cheap. I didn't see how it had anything to do with us but ok. We were going back and forth about paying for what we had but not what she barely touched. Eventually she offered that she would only charge for half. Needless to say we will not be going back.",30,C,Singha Thai Viet Restaurant,Singha Thai Viet Restaurant,singha thai viet restaurant,1.0

Really cozy and comfortable. My guess is that the more word gets out, the harder it'll be to get in! They have booths, which I prefer and a nice square bar in the center. 

My ONLY con is that they validate your valet parking ticket which brings the cost down to $10. Parking in the area isn't great due to all the construction.

"Pibb's Rib Shack was darn good bbq. This food truck was posted up outside my apartment complex one evening during our scheduled food truck night.

Pibb's had a decent amount of options to choose from, including sandwiches and dinner meals. They offered chicken, beef, ribs, pulled pork, meatloaf, sausage, brisket. Pretty much anything you could want.

I went with a two meat meal. I always like be able to try a variety and at only $13 for the two meat meal with 2 sides, it was a great deal. I ordered the pulled pork and the brisket. For my sides, mac and cheese and collard greens.

The meal was hefty and large portioned. The two meats were topped with my choice of sauce, sweet bbq. The pulled pork was top quality, not fatty, juicy and packed with flavor. With the sauce on it, it was awesome. The brisket was also fantastic. The long, thin strips of meat had that slight char on the edges, juicy and flavorful.

The mac and cheese was creamy, baked and super good. The collard greens had great flavor as well. Everything was standout and I'd definitely eat here again. Top quality bbq.",1,A,Pibb's Rib Shack,Pibb's Rib Shack,Pibb's Rib Shack Inc.,4.0

I was looking forward to enjoying a similar taste experience, and so was my companion, who had heard about Mofongo and was excited to try it. He was incredibly disappointed once he did. And after tasting it myself, the flavor and texture were vastly different from anything I'd experienced in Puerto Rico. It was...weird. He did enjoy his steak.

I had chicken soup and Moro...the soup had a somewhat decent flavor (not amazing) but a lot of small bones and gristle, and the Moro was mostly dry rice and lacked flavor.

The woman behind the counter was friendly and efficient taking my order. Their menu is located on one wall of the restaurant on a couple of large blackboards. Essentially you have your choice of any Mexican food item, with any Mexican protein you want in it, and the pricing is adjusted accordingly.

I chose a combo of things; enough to last for 2 meals. Fresh made guacamole was very good, and I enjoyed their chips. I tried two tacos, one with chorizo, and one with chicken tinga, which I liked best. I love that they give you the option of Mexican or American style (lettuce, tomato, cheese, etc) when you get tacos.

I also tried two sopes, which is my go-to at any Mexican place. They were okay. I didn't love the fried disc they were served on, although I did like the toppings of campechano and picadillo.

2nd time ordering food and it's awesome! Indian food in tampa is pretty weak outside of a few select spots (1-2 max come in mind) and in new tampa has been traditionally horrendous the last 10+ years we have lived here. So glad to have a place we have finally go to with great food. We have been running the list on the menu with great success but even sweeter is the owner's recommendations on what is really great today. He did not steer us wrong. Also the mango pickle was like my grandmother's homemade version which is saying a lot. Keep up the great work!

"After a seemingly endless construction and their decision to not open for lunch I wasn't sure if I'd ever get to try this open-grill steakhouse. Now that I have, the word that springs to mind is ""pedestrian"".

The tuna martini appetizer was quite good, a spicy tuna and greens concoction that you really need to mix to fully enjoy. The sushi was pretty bland, but to be honest, I find this to be the rule rather than the exception in these kinds of restaurants.

I hope, for the restaurant's sake, that it was the first night for our cook. Our food was below average and  the performance didn't entertain even our young child.

The service was very good except for one thing.. I was not familiar with the whole sake selection so went with the waiter's recommendation.. it tasted like water with a little vodka poured into it. He was, however prompt in filling our large party's requests and accommodating.

"I didn't know what to think when my parents asked if I'd like to go to a place called Del Rio's. Then they said it was Latin and New Orleans cuisine and I was jazzed.

But after walking into the restaurant and feeling like I was walking into a family's personal kitchen, I felt at home. It's BYOB, which I wish we would have known before showing up but that's not their fault. I love BYOB spots since that's where you spend the most money.

On to dinner, I had the Shrimp Creole and all I can say it WOW. It was really good. The portion size was huge especially for the price. It's a little bit spicy with a great albeit subtle smokey flavor. It also come with a side salad that has a nice dressing that's some sort of vinaigrette that tasty.

"I believe this may be the original Outback Steakhouse. I think that Outback is to blame for my Steak Addiction. I got hooked before I was old enough to drive. Now, more than 15 years later, I still love that juicy steak like it was the first time I tasted it. Instinctively, I always go with Victoria's Filet, a Loaded Baked Potato, and a Caesar Salad. I usually get a Fosters, Australian for beer, to wash it down. And when I am feeling extra greedy, I will start off with a Bloomin' Onion. But if you do that be careful, those Bloomin' Onions have been known to ruin an appetite or two.

I have been to this location a few times. The staff have always been professional and friendly. I have never had any problems. The food is usually speedy. I have dined at the bar and in a booth, service is good at both. The only complaint that I have is the parking lot. It is not large enough for the crowd. Luckily, it probably keeps the wait times inside to a minimum. 

If you love steaks and you are stuck up about them, then Outback's chain steakhouse menu may not make you super thrilled. But if you love steak and can put up with the chain vibe, then you should really like Outback. It is my favorite chain steakhouse.

We do not speak Spanish but she's spoke fairly good English and took us through the menu and offered some options that are very popular and things she really liked. We ended up ordering two entrées and an appetizer. I'm still not exactly sure what I ordered but it was fantastic.

I almost want an order of just the chicken chicharrones, they're so tasty. The sauces for sides complement the flavors well, and the bleu cheese on the burger was just enough without overpowering.
I've worked for a lot of small businesses that have to compete with the cheaper, faster options around the corner, and I really hope these guys don't go under just because their prices are higher than standard fast food choices. If you want something that is sub-par and seems cheap, then go get that KFC by all means. But if you want REAL food for a very fair price, then please check this place out.

Usually I get a roast beef but I decided to try the bacon Swiss chicken (see photo). It was okay. Maybe as good as the one at Wendy's. 

What's weird about this location is the dining room is mostly two person tables. No booths. No partitions, no decor. It's like a very bare bones cafeteria. I will say it was at least clean so that's good.

"We recently visited Edge on a Friday night around 8:00pm after having dinner downstairs at Elevage. I absolutely love rooftop bars so I'm very excited that South Tampa finally has one. 

The decor included many oversized chairs and benches with several outdoor heaters, which was nice because the breeze can get quite aggressive up there. I would have liked the music to be a bit louder, but it seemed like they only had a couple speakers.

There was someone managing the entrance, I believe she was counting how many people were coming and going. We were only there about an hour but it never seemed overly crowded. Service was a little slow at first, it took us about 15 minutes to get a waitress to come to our table, so maybe try ordering at the bar before you sit.

"Today my family and I attended the Cuban Sandwich Festival in Ybor City. I wish I could review the event as a whole, because we were very disappointed overall, but we were not disappointed with Alessi. Basically, Alessi was the only vendor at the festival that was approachable without waiting in an insane (like 50+ people) line.

The reason that Alessi did not have a line, I think, is that they only had cold Cubans, not pressed. We were there rather late for lunch and my kids were starving, so we decided to give the Alessi cold Cuban a try. We really wanted a Miami-style Cuban (no salami), but could not locate the only Miami-style Cuban vendor that was supposed to be there. So a Tampa-style Cuban (with salami) it was. 

The Cuban was very good, with fresh soft bread and tasty meats/cheese/pickle. The people at the kiosk were very friendly and happily cut the sandwich into four pieces for us all to share (my two kids, husband, and myself).

We were expecting to have a wide variety of vendors to choose from, but that was not the case. We could have gotten a corn dog, chicken, rice and beans, all kinds of fried stuff...just not a big choice of Cubans.

good food. good service. nice place. however I found there online menu misleading and I took a party of 20 pluse to this place expecting much lower prices. and I wouldent complain so much about the price if I were getting meat with my dishes. but for pasta with a small amount of meat on it for $20.00 per plate on average is rediculus. could have gotten the same food some place els for half the price with more meat on it. is $18.00 for a small cesar salad with a chiken brest on it justified I don't think so. will never return there again.,25,B,Lauro Ristorante,Lauro Ristorante,Lauro Ristorant3,2.0

"The hotel is part of a country club chain and we enjoyed a round of golf. Challenging course. 

Our summary:

- the place is a little worn but adequate (there are 25 or so rooms)

- the housekeeping was very pleasant and so was the cook lady that we spoke with. Each was genuinely nice. 

- the free/included breakfast was yogurt, bagels, apples, coffee/tea. No protein like eggs or sausage, and oddly, the coffee seemed to always be cold each day. It was disappointing on some level. Nothing felt like it was truly fresh or local. Just meh. 

- Someone mentioned the hotel staff (e.g. Lorraine). And true that she could be a little warmer to guests. Oddly seemed overly concerned with booking directly on our next stay (ie, not booking through a paid travel site). if you call them, be prepared for a sales pitch on are you ready to book your room. this requires giving credit card manually over the phone (that's not good credit card security). you can cancel up to 48 hours before and still get your 1-night deposit back.

- when you check in there is a pre-authorization charge for more than you expect to pay for the stay to cover incidentals. all hotels are doing this to avoid getting stuck with bad credit cards and customers who try to scam them. so that doesn't show up on your statement, only the actual charges. 

- They have some $10/day facilty fee but that's ridiculous given that you are paying for everything ala carte and there is not even a free newspaper, etc. 

- If you get a good deal versus your other choices by all means stay here but expect it to feel like a southern plantation that's a bit worn but quiet. Other than a snack for breakfast (w/o protein you are always hungry), we ate off site for the whole stay, so we have no idea about the regular menus.

- free parking is plentiful and there are dining choices within a 10 min drive (ex, red lobster, etc).

- the beds were very comfortable.

- as much as we would like to give this 4 stars, it doesn't have the service or polish needed. example, no valet to park or help with our bags, mediocre breakfast, worn feel (but quiet), etc. 

- It's a solid 3 or 3.5 stars. 

- A restful stay is nearly guaranteed. 

- Good but not great. 

- there is a refrigerator in each room and free self parking.",38,C,Tampa Palms Golf & Country Club,Tampa Palms Golf & Country Club,T@mp@ P@lms Golf & Country Club,3.0

Our waiter was real attentive and our food came out rather quickly. If you're a beer guy they have a decent selection of bottles here.

"Great selection of food with a beautiful view.

Whoever chose the businesses that got to occupy the spots at Sparkman Wharf did a great job. In my opinion, there isn't a dud in the bunch. I love that none of them are huge chains and they are all Tampa locals. There is also a great variety of food choices so everyone can find something. 

We went at a kind of random time on a weekday, but since school was out there were tons of families just chilling. I would be more wary about going here when it is hot, but I'm not going to speculate on that without experiencing it first hand. 

There is a ton of seating. Almost all of it was taken, but the grass looks like a nice place to pop a squat and enjoy some food. My husband went for tacos and I went with an acai bowl. The acai bowl was on par in terms of cost about what I pay at a normal brick and mortar store. The tacos were on the more expensive side, so I don't feel like I can say that you'll pay a premium here until I experience more vendors. 

I love being right on the water. It's nice to stand and look out. 

We didn't have to deal with parking since we are Aquarium members. That's another positive to Sparkman Wharf. You can walk to so many places! We walked to the Aquarium and we also went to walk the Riverwalk a bit. It is so centrally located to a lot of fun happenings.

"I've never been to the original Sa Ri One, so I can't comment on it or compare it to SRO Lunch Box; however even after just one visit, SRO Lunch Box has won me over.

As others have mentioned, there's major construction (as of the date that I wrote this) on 56th, so it can be very much of a hassle to find and navigate to. Once you pass the Firestone, I believe (coming from USF), you're almost there. Not to mention the parking lot is extremely small, so be careful.

So there wasn't anyone inside eating there, but I figured it was a cute little place and lunch break was over for most people working anyway. I ordered a tuna kimbap for $4.50 and a kalbi lunch box (for around $9). All  lunch boxes come with a small container of miso soup (I got everything to-go), a soda or water, a side of cucumber kimchi (oi sobaegi) and two pan-fried dumplings (mandu) with a small container of dipping sauce made of soy sauce and I guess some sort of hot sauce (though I didn't taste it at all). It also comes with a separate container of rice... Lots and lots of rice. It's probably enough for you to save some for the next meal.

The food is no doubt authentic (even as my food was being prepared by a non-Korean). The kalbi is really tender with a balance of sweetness and saltiness. The cucumber kimchi is slightly spicy, but not extremely... So if you can't handle extremely spicy foods well, it still may be suitable for you. The mandu was pretty good too. Not the best in the world by any means, but still very satisfying. The kimbap was excellent. You can taste all the ingredients in it, plus the roasted seaweed and the sesame oil that's infused into the kimbap. It's also extremely filling; one roll comes in (if I remember correctly?) 10 pieces. It's enough to split with friends or family as a snack (or all to yourself!) or as a meal itself. The miso soup tasted really good as well. It definitely did not taste instant, and there were two solid chunks of soft tofu too. I wish I could've had more hehe.

Overall, the prices are pretty good. The food is delicious. They also sell Korean fried chicken, patbingsu (shaved snow ice which I HAVE to try!), frozen yogurt (and they have mochi topping here!), other entrees (bulgogi, tonkatsu, etc.), bibimbap... and I'm sure there's a lot more.

"The highlight was definitely the salsa bar. I've seen Mexican restaurants with a wide array of free hot sauces, but this was the first time I've seen a place offer ten free homemade salsas to eat with your meal. Fantastic!

While I was checking out the salsas, Rene, the owner, came over to discuss the different salsas with me and even showed me in the back where the salsas were being prepared from fresh grilled tomatoes; he emphasized how they are using the freshest ingredients possible. My favorite was the peanut salsa--a delicious degree of spiciness. 

I'm training for a race, so I've had to cut way back on what I eat. I ordered a grilled chicken (pollo asado) burrito and ate half of it. Very, very tasty! I was with a party of about a dozen people and everyone seemed to really enjoy their meals. I think 10 of the 12 people had to get to-go boxes because the portions were too big for one meal. (That's a good thing!)

I confirmed with Rene that a Taco Bus will soon be opening in St Pete and it will be modeled after the Bus in Seminole Heights. There will be both outdoor and indoor (air conditioned!!) seating. He said that if everything runs on schedule, the new Taco Bus should be opening this November. This was my first time to meet Rene, and he seemed like a really good and humble guy. When I asked him how he made the Bus so popular, he simply said that he had been very blessed. Now there's a good guy!

Overall, Taqueria Monterrey is a great little Mexican restaurant.

I order tostones with guacamole, at least the guacamole was decent and the tostones were fried perfectly but I tried their rice and beans and does not have much flavor and their Cuban sandwich should be called a bread salad because they barely put any meat and all it is is just a big amount of lettuce. I won't recommend going here.",16,B,Asados Al Carbon,Asados Al Carbon,asados al carbon,2.0

Brown rice is available for an additional cost, which is a great option.   - The person taking our order was friendly, knowledgeable about the menu and helpful.

I got the Ybanini and my husband got the Cubanito and the seasoned fries. Everything was terrific! I preferred my Cuban over my husband's burger, but I couldn't stop eating his fries!!! The fries were perfectly crispy and were well spiced with a slight kick.

"I was in the area and got a restaurant.com coupon for this place since I saw that tag ""sports bar"".  I should have known better as when I walking in, there were 2 employees outside talking about ""how damn hot it was"".  Whatever, I didn't let that bother me. We walked in and no one directed us anywhere even though there were several employees around.  This along with the fact that there were no actual customers, made me quickly realize to take my food to go.  This place has the typical Hispanic-Cuban food.  White rice, yellow rice, black beans, red beans, chicken, ropa vieja, pernil, ect.  My coupon was $15 and I needed to spend $30 (again, I was expecting a sports bar).  Anywho, my $30 didn't go as far as I thought it would, I mean, I got a lot of different items, but it could have done more damage elsewhere. The guy taking the order was new, he was really nice and he was trying to do as much as he could.  The owner was eating lunch nearby and the counter guy was asking for help and she obviously didn't want to help.  Very rude, I'm sure she didn't know I spoke spanish as she muttered ""I didn't want to stand up"".  We had to wait for the beef empanadas and walked over to the bar area where I saw that they also apparently had wings and jalapeno poppers among other things I wasn't aware of.  I asked if there was a menu and she pointed to where I had just come from.  I asked about the food listed in their area, and again she just said ""they cook it"".  At this point I just wanted my food so that I could leave. I found everyone there besides the new guy to be very short and rude.

We waited to get home to eat.   The yuca didn't have enough flavor.  My fiance had white rice, pernil and garbanzo beans (random, I know),  he said ""it wasn't bad, it's not something I'd go back and get"".  My meal was yellow rice and black beans with the ropa vieja. The rice and beans were ok, I've had better. The ropa vieja was actually pretty good.  Empanadas were also good, but pricey.  I realized that after ordering 2 empanadas my bill went up $10 which I didn't realize until later...this was the owner that rang it up since the new guy hadn't yet been trained on the coupons.  Whatever, I won't go back to dispute it.  Not going back to this place.  As a Hispanic female myself, I've definitely had better food than this in other places, they were also kind of cheap with their food. $2 for 5 small fried sweet plantains.   I may sound harsh, but I that's because I grew up eating this type of food. I don't see this place being in business much longer based on the fact that there was no one there and their lack of good service.",7,A,Havana Blue Sports Bar & Restaurant,Havana Blue Sports Bar & Restaurant,H@v@n@ Blue Sports B@r & Rest@ur@nt,1.0

We got a pitcher of beer and she continued to fill our mugs as we drank. The food was good and home-made tasting.

The decor is super neat. We came here for a birthday and our server, Holston, really accommodated us. He wore a mask the whole time (over the nose and all) so our party felt safe. Let's talk about the cocktails. The fanciest drink I ever had was a strawberry daiquiri at Applebee's , but boy these cocktails are something special. We paired that with a fancy cheese board (sharcutry). We were recommended the beef car patchio. At first I was nervous because I've never eaten a meat so fancy but I just got paid so I took a gamble and ordered it. WOW. Amazing. The broccolini (LOL a fancy broccoli) and burrata were spectacular. We saved calories for the bread pudding and it was worth it. FYI bread pudding is not your classic jello pudding with bread on top.

Terrible. Will never order here again. I feel bad for the delivery boy if he was new, but when I phoned Jimmy Johns after 40 minutes to see where my sandwich was, it rang and rang. After 3 attempts to call, and no one answering, I gave up.",6,A,Jimmy John's,Jimmy John's,Jimmy John's Inc.,2.0

"This review is for takeout. I ordered from their website.

I ordered the beef kafta kabab with salad and also the Kafee special. The website said the food would be ready in 20-30 minutes. We arrived at the restaurant 20 minutes later, and the food was not done. We waited about 10 minutes in the restaurant.

The person at the register was very nice and offered water while we were waiting. She also offered as many sauces and salad dressings as I wanted when she was packing up my food. (I only asked for one tzatziki and one garlic sauce, but if I'd know how dry the kababs would be, I'd have asked for more.)

When I got home, I was disappointed to see that I got the beef kabab rather than the beef kafta kabab. It was a little overcooked and dry. The Kafee special turned out to be a chicken skewer, two falafels, two grape leaves, hummus and rice. The falafels were really really dry. Everything else was fine but not remarkable.

The interior is very stylish with lots of granite and marble and looks like a nice place to eat lunch in downtown (or dinner. They serve wine and beer). If only the food matched the rest of the place. The food is pretty but not tasty. Maybe they need to work on their recipes (they are still brand spanking new).

"I was torn between ordering from this location or the one on Armenia. I chose this location because it was closer. I placed my order online for a large one topping pizza for $7.27. I had a coupon for a free small one topping pizza. The website accepted the coupon code and I paid for the order online.

I drove approximately 2.8 miles to this location which is in a cut off of South Dale Mabry. If you're not familiar with this Hungry Howies or not paying attention, it can be easily missed. 

I picked up my pizzas, they were made as requested, I signed my receipt and crossed ZERO on the tip field. Therefore, $7.27 was my total.

A few days later while looking at my bank account I noticed a charge for $10.27 that was deducted from Hungry Howies. Ummmm I'm confused! How dis this happen? I immediately called and spoke with ""Red"" the assistant manager who was beyond unhelpful. I wonder how many customers they do this to. Why would I pay $3.00 for a tip on a 7.00 order that I drove almost 3 miles to get??

My boyfriend and I visited on a Friday night around midnight. They close at 3 am and we read good reviews so we gave it a shot. We called ahead to put a delivery for takeout and were told they were not doing take out because of a private party. We were told we were welcome to come and place an order there....odd.

Anyways, we drove down there and noticed that on the door of the restaurant there was a sign stating the private party was there from 7pm-9pm. Confused as to why we were told we couldn't order because of the private party since we called at midnight.

When we walked in there were only 5 people total in the restaurant...we walked in an sat at the bar. Only two people were working. A skinny girl with black hair and heavy set bangs and a man with a beard making pizzas (presumably the cook). We sat there for 5 minutes without any greeting, no one helped us or seemed to care. The girl at the bar did not look our way ONCE. She just stood in the same spot talking to ONE other guy at the bar. We kept waiting for her to come over but she didn't....

We finally got the cooks attention and ordered a pepperoni pizza. Waited 15 minutes. While we waited more customers entered. Same girl employee didn't look their way either, didn't seem to care, kept talking to same guy (probably a friend). Didn't see her work once while we were there.

"Craving burgers on a lazy gloomy Saturday afternoon and not wanting to go far from home my honey and I decided to check out Smashburger. We had not yet been and kept getting mail from them to come check them out. It is located in a plaza with a buffalo wild wings, Jeremiahs Italian icees, pizza hut, another broken egg, and Tijuana Flats amongst a few other non-food centered businesses. The restaurant is very clean. When we arrived parking was a little tricky but we eventually found some. The restaurant was not busy at all so the parking must have been from the other establishments. 

When we walked up to the counter the lady was gracious, she gave us a minute to look over the big menu above her head and then promptly took our orders. We were then provided with our drink cups, a table # and we were on our way. We sat in the front of the store by the windows and placed our # on the table. Not even 10 mins later our food was out. Everything was right which was good. We both got cheeseburgers, honey got everything on his and I just got onions and the house sauce. We decided to split large fries. The cook was nice enough to split them up among our baskets. 

Now on to the food. It was not bad but it also nothing special. For a 'burger joint' can you fault me for expecting more? Like I said it wasn't bad and I will likely be back if I want something close by but I would rather take a bit of a longer drive to Burger Monger.

"Exquisite. Exceptional. Expensive. This is a sophisticated way to enjoy authentic Vietnamese cuisine. 

There's no sharing a communal bottle of siracha or hoisin sauce with other diners here. It's served in a small ramekin, perfectly portioned just for you and your pho, which costs about double what you would pay at most Vietnamese noodle shops. The chicken is organic though and it's served in a beautiful extra clean looking bowl. I still had trouble swallowing the $13 price tag for the soup along with a $3 split fee for my husband and myself sharing it. We paid $16 for soup. Vietnamese store owners everywhere must be looking at them with awe and envy. Teas and limeade beverages range from $3.50-5. 

Restaurant BT and its dining experience are unlike other Vietnamese restaurants though. For one, it's not in a strip mall. This is probably the most overlooked restaurant on Mac Dill with most drivers' attention steered toward the neon orange Datz sign across the street. 

Enter the small building and you'll feel the upscale atmosphere - white linen table cloths, clear plastic French bistro chairs, calming environment, professional service, and nice tableware. Outside is a serene patio with bamboo, orchids and a small garden that helps you forget the construction and traffic just steps away. Parking is very limited as they only have a small lot behind the building with spaces so narrow I recommend letting your passenger out before squeezing into the space. 

My last recommendation is the duck burrito. It's like a Peking duck pancake roll but beautifully wrapped and presented for you to enjoy with no effort on your part other than consuming. The pork bun entree was also superb. Shrimp rolls were fresh.

I don't believe there is anything on the menu that isn't prepared well.  It's authentic Vietnamese, just presented in a sophisticated manner.

An Asian man was extremely aggressive when I asked him if we could have a larger table. We have a little one and it's just easier to be able to keep food out of reach. Then our server Dante forgot our appetizer. At that point I just said never mind on the appetizer. They comped it and gave it to me anyway which woulda been great if the crab cake bites would of been edible. They were burnt rice cakes with fake crab. Then my seafood was brought out in a plastic bag. The corn was soggy the potato's were black and my crab had no meat in it.

The customer service was very impersonal, the guy was annoyed by me asking questions about the sauces and the options. Another couple came in notice his attitude and walk away.

"I have a client in the USF area, and I'm always on the lookout for a different place to eat while in the 'hood.

PJ Dolan's is an Irish Pub & Grille located along Bearss Avenue, just to the west of Bruce B. Downs. The restaurant sits back from the road in a mixed-use shopping center filled with a variety of other restaurants and shops. PJ's used to be a location for Remington's Steakhouse, and prior to that it was a Mexican restaurant, and who knows what else along the way. PJ's has been there for a little over 3 years, so let's hope that it's there to stay.

The basic layout of the place hasn't changed despite the various owners. There's an outdoor covered patio, along with an indoor bar area that has darts, pool and other sports, indoor and outdoor seating for the restaurant, and an outdoor stage area for the live entertainment / bands. PJ's has Open Mic nights for singers and musicians, Karaoke, and Trivia nights during the week.

The menu is a nice mix of classic bar appetizers with a few Irish specials like Scotch Eggs, Irish Bells, and Irish Egg Rolls filled with Corned Beef Hash. There's a nice mix of soups, salads, sandwiches, and burgers for lunch; and some heartier entrees for dinner including Corned Beef n' Cabbage, Shepherd's Pie, Bangers & Mash, and so on.

Back in the bar you'll find plenty on tap including Guinness, Harp's, Smithwick's, Kilkenny, a couple of ciders, and more. You'll find plenty of traditional drannnnnnks like the Black & Tan, Snake Bite, and a Black Haze, along with craft beers, imports, and plenty to get you in trouble.

For lunch I had the Corned Beef Melt with a cup of Irish Potato & Leek soup. It was good food for a fair price.

If you're coming in for a big party (4+), I suggest the BBQ or what our family generally order the Traditional Korean meal, plentiful of food for 4 people; loads of side dishes, BBQ beef and short ribs, fish, soup, noodles, and white rice.

"Heed the words of Speedy Gonzalez, ""Ándale, ándale! Arriba! Arriba!"" And get on over to the new Nueva Cantina in South Tampa.

Before you arrive, you'll notice the brightly-colored awnings and as you draw closer, the wonderful artwork on the wall next to the entrance.  Upon entering, I am greeted by the hostess and a gentleman. I comment on the beautiful artwork outside.  The gentleman informs me he is the owner, and the artwork was done by two artist friends from New York. The wonderful artwork is throughout the restaurant.

It's very crowded and people are streaming in behind me.  The owner tells me it will be a 20-minute wait (but it was only about ten) for a table.  I ask how long they've been open; he stated Wednesday was the Soft Opening, and the Grand Opening was Friday.

Their grand opening was day before yesterday, so give them time to work out a few kinks.  I notice the beautiful blue floor which resembles a bowling ball; the hostess warns me to be careful as it's slippery. She was right--I saw several people slip and catch themselves. Fortunately, no one--self included--ended up on the floor!  

Dinner was good: I enjoyed my Tostadas (sans meat).  The rice portion, however, was skimpy; most Mexican restaurants serve far more as a portion size.  The waitress was attentive, so kudos on service. When the meal was finished , she reviewed dessert choices and mentioned flan was on the menu, but they didn't have any yet. I was tempted to try the Plaintains Foster, but she pointed out it is a rather sweet dessert.

So, overall was it authentic Mexican? Not really.  But, I enjoyed my meal and will be back. Maybe even try the Plaintains Foster to keep my sweet tooth happy.

"I've been going here for years and even supported these guys through the pandemic but the last couple of years have just not been as good as the first. When this place first started the service was awesome, the beers were amazing, and the food was on point, all for a reasonable price. But since then I've been consistently disappointed. The beers here are still stellar so no need to worry there. But there is always something that makes my experience there not so great. Last time I ordered there weekend special nachos they came out in under a minute!?!? How a $15 plate of fresh nachos came out in under a min is because it had been sitting in the kitchen for god knows how long. The guacamole was getting brown, the cheese was dry and hardened and the meat on it was blackened and dry. Another time we went the hostess forgot about my party and left us waiting. It feels like the servers here are always new and getting trained, bound to make mistakes...which is understandable the first couple times but why do I always get the new guy. We receive the wrong order, wrong drinks, wrong drink size, and we sometimes hardly ever see the server. The bar tenders here used to fill up our growlers with anything we liked. Now it's not even worth bringing in our growlers because they hardly have any on tap they are willing to fill it with. 
   Don't get me wrong the beer is great, the food is ok, and the venue is not bad. But it's come to the point where I can expect to get disappointment. I always come in knowing things will be different, but something always disappoints.

"I tried this place on a whim one day, having had a hankering for chicken wings. Wild Wing Cafe definitely has them, in thirty-three different flavors, ranging from mild-medium-hot (and beyond) type, as well as specialty flavors that range all over the globe. In tow was a spicephobic friend of mine, and there were wings that her mild palate could definitely experience. Each flavor is nicely labeled with ranging numbers of peppers, depending on spice level. The menu also offers some sandwiches and salads, but I came for the wings, man!

The restaurant has various platter sizes, ranging from 8 to 50, allowing you to choose two flavors per order. My friend got the 8 piece, and since I had trouble choosing, I picked the final option, the 25-piece sampler platter, which gives one the choice of five different flavors. So, between me and my pal, we chose: Italian and Thai (hers), and Chernobyl (3 peppers), Ginger, Jalapeno Cheddar (2 peppers), JoJo's Red Dragon (2 peppers), and Island. 

When our wings finally came, mine was served in a large sectioned platter, like one might see at a party where a vegetable platter was served. No one told me which wings were which, but that was okay with me. I slid up my sleeves and began my adventure. 

The Chernoybl wing was pretty spicy, but it still had flavor. The Ginger definitely had a definitive ginger taste, and ended up being one of my favorites of this whole endeavor. JoJo's was a teriyaki, but with a very hot kick as soon as it hit the back of my throat. Island was nice and mild, but with a bit of a Jamaican jerk undercurrent. Jalapeno Cheddar wasn't all that hot, but you could taste both flavors. 

I also tried my friend's wings. The Italian was just okay, too mild to really have much flavor. The Thai had a nice peanut taste to its sauce.

I recommend this place, definitely, although it could get a little pricey. However, if you want to eat your fill of wings, go early and get the all you can eat wings from 11-2.

The waitress was incredibly friendly, was good with recommending different rolls as well as what fresh fish they had available that day.

My and my bf ordered the fatty tuna, shrimp, squid, striped bass nigiri sushi as well as a rainbow roll and a cucumber eel roll. The fatty tuna was delicious, the fish was high quality and you can definitely taste the difference between that and regular tuna. The shrimp was the best I have ever had, not cooked like your average sushi place, actually raw but not fishy at all. The shrimp head came along completely fried, and yes I ate all of that.

"It is about time we got a place like this in Carrollwood. Actually, Tampa in general was lacking a wine bar like this.

The wine shoppe is in the same plaza as black rock and villagio movie theater, it's hard to see from Dale Mabry.

"Just OK.....nothing to brag about but was nice to give it a try.  Came her on my lunch break so they weren't busy but did get busier after I ordered.  They do make the sandwiches fresh --- they make it at the front counter w/the ingredients and then send to the back kitchen for them to grill it.  I ordered the Healthy delight which is the grilled cheese w/mozzarella, feta, organic baby spinach, tomatoes, and red onions.  I ordered it on wheat bread.  The cheese was nice and melty, although the feta does not really melt well like the mozzarella and the bread was nice and crispy.  Since the cheese is only added to 1 side of the sandwich it really doesn't seal in the ingredients so as you bite into it, the spinach drops out. This is my only complaint about it.  Lunch was very filling!  The clerk working the counter seemed like she was really interested in being at work today as well -- on her phone when I walked up and no greeting.  When I went to speak on what I wanted to order, I was told in her monotone voice to go to the register to order, which I did move down a bit to order.

"Made reservations for a party of 15 on a Saturday at 8pm. I was called the day of and asked if I wanted to sit inside since it was cold out to which I agreed to. Upon arrival I was told in order to sit inside my party would have to sit at 2 separate tables but next to each other, I asked if I had any other choice and was told no. It took over 20min to be seated which was uncalled for since it was completely dead. Maybe about 5 tables of couples seated outside. They have a bar both indoors and outdoors and the 3 tables that are available inside are in the hotel lobby. The seating was horrible. Not only was I displeased with half my party sitting at another table but the lobby was full of people standing around with luggage just steps from our table. We asked to change our table to the outdoor seating since we would rather bare the cold than the indoor arrangements. Upon our request we were told that we could not switch since all the seating outdoors was already reserved. Unhappy we went back to our table. As we looked over our menus our waitress told us we could sit outside and moved us to a large table with a heater on each side. There was only one waitress for our party so we tried to be accommodating to the slow pace. At this point it's already 9pm when we got to order drinks after plying musical chairs. I ordered a mojito which was basic. Throughout the night my guests found that getting up from the table to order at the bar was a lot faster. Food arrived at 930pm which is where I give my only 2 starts for this review. My food was delicious. I ordered the mushroom flatbread and side of truffle fries. I tried my friends grass fed steak and my one bite was so fatty I had to spit it out. She had to do the same a few bites later but she did rave about the mashed potatoes.

"I was feeling lazy, and did not want to cook! It does happen, right? And I wanted meat... grilled tasty meat! I was thinking maybe Churrasco... or Mediterranean Kabobs.  And then I remembered I had bookmarked Perdigon El Sabor... and it had good reviews. I love any kind of Latin food... and some of the Latin countries do some awesome things with a grill, and some meat and skewers!

Grabbed the girlfriend, and off we went. The location is really close to us, and fairly easy to find. Nice on the inside, if a bit small... but it was cozy! A large TV on the wall was cycling images of the various dishes, and they looked wonderful. Another screen in the corner was showing an ad for an advertising company, but was also showing some food pics too, and not too blatant or annoying.

Service was good...  we got water, and batidos right away. Ordered some Calamari for an appetizer, and it was delicious... crispy chunks of yummy squid, and two wonderful sauces to dip it in.

Then the main courses arrived. And they are beautifully presented, and are just mouth watering to look at.. much less eat! Girlfriend had ordered the Parilla de Venezolana and I had ordered the Parilla Mar y Tierra. It was a small mountain of well cooked meat and seafood... with an aroma that was heavenly. The grilled shrimp (two skewers) were the best grilled shrimp I have ever had in a restaurant, absolutely delicous. The beef and pork were also very good... the chicken was bit dry, but definitely edible. The Chorizo was delicious! The Tostones served with were good also. The citrus sauce and pico de gallo were very good too.

The mango Batido's we had were excellent... and if they had only had a bit of rum in them, OMG!  :) 

We did not do the desserts, as there was no room left... but I do want to try the flan and the Tres Leches cake... I love them, and will just have to take them home with me, next time!

"A subsequent visit to Streetcar Charlie's solidified their higher star rating for me.

For one, I was wrong about the beer selection. They have quite a few special bottled beers and one seasonal tap - just ask and they'll give you a list of what's available.

But the real reason that I'm reviewing them again is the level of neighborhood friendliness and service that I received the other night.

I walked in around 11pm, fresh off a plane from New York, kinda tired, but not wanting to go home. I asked if they had a late night menu, which they do, but the kitchen was closing since it was a weeknight. Totally understandable, so I said I would just have a beer.

The bartender was undeterred, however, from finding me food. ""You can't just have an empty stomach!"" she decried and promptly went into the kitchen. A minute later, she came out of the kitchen, beaming, with a bowl of clam chowder that was freshly made a few hours before.

""There, we can't have you starving,"" she told me, lining up Tabasco sauces and crackers.

Most places I've been to would have just pulled the late night menu out of my hands and plopped the beer in front of me, informing me that they were closing soon...but not Streetcar Charlie's. Charlie himself came and chatted with me, asking me about my trip.

"In the past week that I've been living in Seminole Heights- I have visited Nani's twice- once for breakfast and once for lunch.

As with most restaurants in this area, you have to be looking for it to know it's there.  It's very easy to drive by it and think it's an auto shop of sorts.  But, it's definitely worth stopping at.

It's got a small indoor seating area, and a patio area as well (which I imagine will be nice once the weather is better).  Their cuban bread is to die for- I had it both as a grilled cheese for lunch, and as a ""toast"" on the side of my eggs for breakfast. 

I don't drink coffee, but my friend was raving about how good it was.  

The service is friendly- I really like that it's a small local owned sandwich shop.

We tried out four different types of sliders just so we wouldn't be short of variety. Ordered out 3 plain krystal burgers, 3 double Krystal with cheese, 3 chili cheese Krystal burgers, and 3 bacon with cheese burgers and an order of chili cheese fries. The regular krystal sliders did remind us of White Castle burgers but the other 3 kinds just tasted too salty. Their bacon was pretty big to be put in a slider but was also salty. The chili was also so salty on the burgers and fries that we didn't even get to finish the fries. The cheddar shredded on top of the fries looked like they just put it on top without even trying to melt it.

"First, if this were just a review of the service, it would be five stars. All the servers were friendly, helpful, and efficient. If this were 3 years ago (we usually stay at least one night at the hotel when visiting the west coast of Florida), the review would probably be five stars overall. However, there are  factors that brought the rating down from what would have been stars, and not all of them are necessarily the restaurant's fault. 

First, the menu has been substantially reduced from what it was a while back. This is unfortunate, albeit very common in the pandemic environment. For a pescatarian, about the most ""exciting"" thing on the menu is currently shrimp scampi. This time around, the main dining room was closed, with only limited seating availability in the bar. 

We got our food to go and took it back to the room, which offered little in the way of surfaces at which to eat. I had the shrimp scampi, which came with no sides of any kind and had only six shrimp. It was of reasonable quality, but in my opinion there is no shrimp scampi with only six shrimp and no sides that is worth $26. My wife had a grilled chicken sandwich with fries. She said the sandwich was very good, and the fries were also quite good. 

Later in the day, we got a margherita flatbread with extra cheese that was also quite good.

Breakfast the next morning was a bit disappointing. The only option was the breakfast bar - no ordering off the menu, which raises questions about whether the options on the room service menu are actually available. I would suggest checking with the hotel if this is important. Two options: continental breakfast (which is free at many hotels) for $12, and the ""full"" breakfast bar for $18. The latter featured scrambled eggs, potatoes,  meat options, French toast, oatmeal, and similar options (very similar to the breakfast we had gotten for free at the Hampton Inn and Suites at Venice Beach by Hilton the previous morning, although the fresh fruit options were much better). Bread options were rather limited, and included plastic wrapped, mass produced muffins rather than fresh ones. The eggs were slightly overcooked and required a little chopping with the serving spoon before putting them on the plate. The potatoes had become a little soggy, probably as a result of their time in the chafing dish. The design of the dish appeared to have water that condensed on the lid stream back into the food when opened, which doesn't help things like potatoes. Overall it was okay, but at $18 it did not seem like a very good value. Overall, we found the restaurant overpriced for what we received.

We typically travel to Florida at least once a year, and the Doubletree Rocky Point is a convenient stop for us on the way back.

"If I could give a negative I would but that's yelps scoring problem

We went for Sunday brunch based upon a best of review in creative loafing. We were told a birthday party just came in so it would be 15 minutes but we could sit. So we did. For about 5 minutes and the waiter 1 came over and took our orders. Bacon and eggs and one of the salad combinations. Waiter 2 brought us a water and coffee after another 20 minutes and said our order was good. About 30 minutes later we got refills.  It was then i commented that the folks beside us to the left had arrived about 15 minutes ago and had just been served  Finally after 1 hour and 15 minutes we got served.

Then when the bill came we were charged $10 for an $8 item and $10 for a $6 item. That took about 10 minutes to correct.

All in all an absolutely MISERABLE experience.  Nothing would make me go back. First time I my life I left a zero tip.  The final nail was when I was trying to get the bill corrected waiter 1 was comping the other table for drinks because of the wait.

From the pepper crusted filet to the short rib risotto, each entree was a home run. The appetizers were on point. I love the bruschetta trio (one grapes saturated with honey, sounded odd but was one of favorite), I do think they should offer the traditional bruschetta as full appetizer, I think it would benefit them since its really good.

She gave me the ""be right with you"", which is absolutely acceptable if you're busy. I've been a bartender for years and I can say she was far from busy. She was not very friendly. No smile, nothing. She was way more interested in people she knew the faces of than the ones she didn't such as myself. When I ordered my food she rolled her eyes when I asked for blue cheese and celery. When my wings arrived they were not breaded even though she had asked me if I wanted them breaded or not, coming here specifically for that. I ate and never said a word. I was never checked on again until I was finished with my food. While sitting at the bar I witnessed the man next to me order a yuengling bottle and her pour him a draft.

There are a handful of places in downtown Tampa area that serve Poke bowls and i'd have to say this place might tie for first with The Hall on Franklin. The reason I enjoyed going to Poke Fish is because of all the options I was given and the ingredients were in front of my face. 
Not to mention they didn't up charge for the good stuff (ahi tuna, salmon, Shrimp). 

I got a large bowl which includes 2 bases and 2 proteins and endless toppings/sauces. I chose brown rice, power greens, ahi tuna, salmon, and shrimp. I highly recommend the poke sauce because it's a perfect mixture of sweet, bold and tangy. I got all of the toppings and then spicy mayo to top it off.

The buns are so beautiful you almost don't want to eat them, emphasis on the 'almost' :) I had the butter white bun first, and it is so soft and delicious, the craisin (raisin?) on top was the perfect amount of tart to accent the sweet buttery cream and bread.

I get the feeling all the food is frozen and they just heat it up, it just doesn't taste fresh or homemade.  More like what you heat up in the frozen food isle, like a Stoffers's lasagna.

I may have given this place 3 stars, but the delivery time is horrendous.  I live about 1 mile from this place, maybe a mile and a half and it takes well over an hour to and hour and a half for them to show up.

Ma Po Tofu- they sub the meat with Chinese mushroom and everything else is the same.  I was pretty impressed by this dish, you can tell the sauce actually had some work in it not the pre-made black and white sauce.  The tofu was soft and silky, the amount  of peas and carrots was perfect/  Also, the dish was actually spicy.

Salt&Pepper Tofu.  The tofu were fried and then seasoned with salt and pepper.  Sounds simple, but tasted delicious.  The only I probably would improve is fried the tofu a little less, time wise.  I think it was fried a little too long and part of the tofu was a little hard and chewy.

Eggplants with Tofu.  This dish definitely was better than I expected.  Most places don't get eggplants right, they usually cover it with too much sauce and cover the taste of the eggplant.  Here, they lightly fried the eggplant so it's the crispy on side then cooked with fried tofu and sauce.   IMO, this dish can be mix with rice pretty nicely like Ma Po Tofu.

"I'm surprised to be the first to review this restaurant, as it appears to have stood for quite some time. Due to the location of this cafe along with the operating hours, I feel confident saying that a large portion of their business comes from those working at the Port of Tampa; it's directly across from the entrance in an older building.

The menu consists of basic sandwiches (Cuban, Roast Beef, Roast Pork, etc) along with a small buffet that I'd assume changes daily. They also have breakfast, hence the opening at 5AM!

I went safe and ordered a Cuban and a bottle of Diet Coke, total was $5.50. It wasn't the best Cuban I have ever had (see: West Tampa Sandwich Shop), but it was still pretty tasty and filled me up on a budget.

It's worth to note that a guy named Carlos seemed to own/run the place and he welcomed each person who walked into the door...most of them seemed to speak back as if long time customers. During my short wait for my sandwich, Carlos offered up a complimentary Cubano espresso.

Fantastic food. This place has excellent cuban dishes prepared in the store. From the outside it looks like a convenience store but actually it is a small grocery and butcher.

"So they opened pretty recently. Very good pizza. A little greasy but still 5 stars and I'll be coming back. A lot of cheese and overall very flavorful.

"Alba Coffee is simply charming--a family-owned business (I believe they are Scottish?) with a menu full of delicious drinks and even more tasty sandwiches. The staff is so friendly and everyone seems genuinely glad to be working there (and they all have glorious foreign accents that make you want to talk with them forever).

Along with a full menu of standard coffee-house drinks, Alba also serves an inspired array of delectable foods. Although a little on the pricey side, each sandwich is unique and different. I always get the cranberry and brie pressed sandwich, which is served on two enormous hunks of bread with chips on the side. 

There are two TVs, unfortunately placed so that no matter where you sit your eyes can't help but stare at the screen. I am not a TV watcher and don't have one in my home at all, so they are a huge distraction for me when I'm trying to have a conversation over a cup of coffee with a friend. However, this has never stopped me from visiting the shop again and again.

Alba has open mic nights, local musician performances, and even an Irish band complete with step dancers who regularly perform at the shop. This is truly an incredible feat--the space is quite small inside the store. They also sell a variety of snacks, trinkets, and goodies from Britain. 

Everything about the place makes you want to come back for more. My only complaint is that each time I go, I always want to spend tons of money just to support the family running the place!",21,B,Alba Coffee,Alba Coffee,Alba Coff33,5.0
"Been looking for a place that carries fresh scallops as they are hard to find down here. Born and raised in FL but lived in CT for 5 years and fell in love with sea scallops while visiting Rhode Island beaches. I've tried the grocery store/warehouse bags of frozen scallops that produced little flavor and were tough. I was able to buy a tub of scallops (11 in a tub) for $16.95 and pan seared them in a cast iron pan with butter and olive oil. Oh man, were they tasty! Light texture, sweet taste.

"I stopped here for lunch with my mom while she was on a work break. I called ahead because I had my dog with me after he had an appointment at Blue Pearl and confirmed they would allow my pup to sit with us on the patio. I was glad to be accommodated and the patio was empty so that worked out perfect. Unfortunately, the service was not amazing. It took about 10 minutes to get waters and over 30 minutes for our order to be taken. We each ordered a burger and I asked for jalapeños to bring added. The meals eventually came out, delivered by someone I assumed was a manager. He didn't ask if anything else was needed and our server did not return to check on us. I had to go inside to get salt and condiments but was not  acknowledged by any staff, rather I just had to find what I wanted on unused tables and take it myself. My burger didn't have the jalapeños I asked for but it was a tasty burger. I wasn't a fan of the broccoli but my dog was happy to help eat my greens. When the server finally came by, we had been done eating for 10 minutes, never had our drinks filled, and asked if we were ready for our check. Not knowing how long it would take to come back, I handed him my card, ready to cash out. I hope service inside was better but with this experience, I wouldn't recommend coming here if you are tight on time.

"I just moved to the area from Texas where I ate tacos at least weekly. Naturally since I've moved here, I've been on the hunt for delicious, authentic tacos to satisfy my reoccurring cravings and I can confidently say that my hunt is officially over. Ranchero Tacos are absolutely fantastic. These rival any of the tacos I had in Texas. I got to the truck about 30 minutes before they closed so I was a little nervous that maybe my food wouldn't be super hot and fresh, but that is so far from what I received. I ordered chips and guac along with 3 tacos: carne asada, al pastor, and carnitas. Everything was made to order and came out piping hot. Even the chips were hot! I'm pretty sure they even made those fresh to order. The guac and all 3 of my tacos had so much flavor. Each type of meat was perfectly seasoned and juicy and paired perfectly with the cilantro, onions, lime and salsas. Everything was so fresh tasting and you could tell the corn tortillas were homemade as well. These are absolutely authentic Mexican tacos and even though I was just there yesterday, I'm already craving them again. I will be back again and again and again.

"First the good:  The ambience is very nice, the food is OK, and the servers are pleasant. 

Next the bad  Rushed from start to finish.  Felt pretty unwelcome. 


My first time in this restaurant, located across the street from where my daughter's volleyball team practices.   Ordered the bruschetta as an appetizer, which featured excellent topping on somewhat overlooked bread.  Had difficulty choosing from the plethora of excellent-sounding appetizers, but finally settled on the ravioli with vodka sauce.   A bread basket was brought to the table along with some complimentary nibbles, and everything seemed in order.   However, that happy feeling soon left as I was asked more than once if I wanted to box up whatever was left on literally every plate I was served in turn.   I had finished my main meal and was enjoying some of the breadsticks, and before I could say a word, they were taken away.   I was given the check and told, ""no rush"", but the server returned within 3 minutes to see if I had perhaps left my credit card yet.

"We have been here many times - we really wanted to like it and had hope that maybe it would get better.  Sadly each visit was worse than the previous one.  Employees are friendly.  The restaurant is reasonably clean and tidy.  However, the food is just meh to awful.  On our last visit it was awful.  Pulled pork was incredibly fatty - more than half was inedible.  The apple crisp was more of an apple muffin , which was completely raw inside.  I mean not a little underdone, it was soupy raw.  Chicken tasted like chemicals and gas.  The sides are pretty bleh - caned green beans, store bought fries, the rest are greasy/old tasting, inedible.  

We have issues every time we visit.  There is a lack of customer service/accommodation.  With the recent menu changes, there is even less flexibility in choices.

A hidden seafood spot in ybor away from all the nightlife so keep your eye out. I come here often cause I enjoy the food and vibe of the dining area. The last two times I was here I got the Florida steam pot with the crawfish bites as a appetizer. The pot is kinda small and somewhat over priced being market price of around $29 dollars and then add another snow crab cluster for $8 dollars it just doesn't seem worth it. The clusters are decent size so you do get a good bit of meat. It comes with about 15 shrimp you peel em. About 10 cuts of sausage and 2-3 ears of corn. Be warned the sauce in the boil is spicy not noted on the menu. My recent trip here compared to last weeks was a drastic change. The lady I had last week was amazing and so attentive and made sure me and my guest had everything and enjoyed everything. Then on Monday I came here to show this place to a friend and it was a complete nightmare. The waiter we had did not even bother to take drink orders after giving us a menu. There was two other small groups there but he kept going to the back so I'm not sure if he was helping cook as well. The wait time for everything was very long. After eventually bringing us our food to start with the appetizer he didn't even bother to bring plates or napkins over for the other guest. With the main corse we awaited still napkins and refills. Then at the end the waiter assumed I wanted to split the check and put the appetizer on my guest check and that's not what I wanted or ever brought up and he was not pleased. I'm just over all disappointed with my most recent trip there with how terrible the service was because this is one of my favorite restaurants in Tampa.

My hungry family went in not knowing this place was take out only and we had a starving 2 year old. After we ordered over $50 of food, I asked the lady if she had a piece of bread or something to hold my son over until the food was ready, she quoted 20-30 min until food was ready. She said she couldn't give  us any because it was all wrapped up. I the back. I had to leave my husband to wait for the order and load my son up in the car and take him to a gas station to get him a snack. I cannot wrap my head around leaving a restaurant to get food. When I went to go pick up my husband from the restaurant, the order was ready, and there was literally a whole baguette in the bag. Why didn't the lady give us that and take it out of our order, or charge me for extra bread? I am upset that we had to leave and go somewhere else to get my son a snack while we waited for our order.

"I have been waiting for a Moroccan restaurant to open up in the Tampa Bay Area and was really excited to see this place come up. Spending some time in Morocco I was really craving a taste of their delicious tangine dish. The restaurant was easy to find and had lots of parking as it is located in a plaza. The place is very bright and has a lot of cute decor. I love that they have beautiful plates out when you sit, just adds to that Morocco vibe. 

Once we were seated we were greeted by our waitress who I believe is also the owner. She informed me that there was no veggie or fish option for the tangine (so disappointing). The main veggie options are most of the apps or a falafel sandwich, I opted for the sandwich as I was really hungry and needed more than an appetizer for dinner. My partner ordered the chicken tangine, this was his first time trying this dish. I also decided to order a small pot of Moroccan tea. While waiting for the food we noticed many more coming in to dine, but still only one waitress. 

Eventually our food came, I was a bit disappointed that my side was French fries but they were okay. The sandwich was also good but nothing out of this world. My partner enjoyed his tangine but was surprised to just get a chicken thigh, no veggies or potatoes just a piece of chicken. He was still hungry to say the least. Our waitress also forgot about our tea. Granted that the place was getting busier and she was the only one waiting tables I figured she was just a little behind. But when we both finished our meals we still didn't have the tea. I reminded her and she brought it out a few minutes later saying she forgot who had ordered a small pot of tea.

"i thought this place could be my new go to chinese delivery place. Wow i was wrong, the guy who answered the phone at first was really nice he helped me out and said he could deliver to me even though im outside their range. so i ordered Mongolian beef combo it came with fried rice and an egg roll, i subbed the fried rice for white rice. He shows up delivers he was nice i tipped him, so far 1000x better than osmay.

I ordered Mongolian Beef Combo which came with fried rice(i asked for white rice though) and an egg roll, and crab meat rangoons. the meat is okay but theres really not much of it, the fried rice could definitely have been better, especially since i didnt even order it, the eggroll was kinda small. As for the rangoons, they werent tne best the issue i had was i could tell they had been cooked in older oil so they tasted like something else. I could have forgiven all of this, and absolutely would have continued ordering from them. After almost 3 years of living in the USF area this was the best delivery chinese ive had, by that i mean when i ate it i didnt automatically say ""this is horrible"".

But when i called the lady about the mistake with my rjce said there was no fix for messed up orders all i wanted was a percentage off or something. All she was willing to do was send the driver with white rice, but it took him 45 mins to get here (which is what he told me it would be) and i didnt want to wait to eat. We went back and forth for a while and it became clear she just didnt care, so i got frustrated and said if you can't do anything for me I'll probably never order from you again. She said "" Okay, no problem, thank you."" and hung up the phone. I'm really not usually very picky about service but her complete uncaring attitute tells me she doesnt care about her customers at all. So ill keep looking for an even half way decent chinese delivery place in the area.",13,A,Duck Duck Express,Duck Duck Express,Duck Duck Express,2.0
"Soooo.....it's a no from me dawg. 

Pros: Loved the shrimp and the garlic butter sauce was delicious. 

Cons: Ordered the blue crab dinner. It was a joke. I was actually insulted. You could tell the crab had been frozen. It was super dry when I cracked it open. No joke like crab jerky. So basically they serve subpar, old crabs and attempt to disguise the taste by drowning the crabs in sauce. Additionally, the crab was so small it was pathetic. I mean how can you as a cook put something like that on my plate?

"I have only been to a genuine New York diner once in my life, so I'm not fit to be an expert on the subject of diners, but I have been to quite a few in Tampa, so that does give me a little knowledge to draw from.  And my knowledge tells me that this place is great!  If it were as close to my house as Three Coins I would probably never be able to decide which to go to since they are so similar.

Yes, you're not going to get high cuisine when you come to a diner, but that's why that plate full of eggs, hash browns and toast is only $4.25.  You go here for some simple comfort food, or a no fuss breakfast, or just because you want to get out of the house but don't want to spend a lot on food.  Or maybe you just love the 50s style decor and the friendly and competent wait staff.  

Personally, I'm thrilled that my pancakes came out tasting like they contained hints of funnel cake and didn't have that oily coating that a lot of flat top cookeries leave on everything.  I love that my wife's over-medium eggs were genuinely over medium and that our coffee tasted like it wouldn't be served anywhere else but a little diner.

Gave this two stars just because of my love for chipotle as a chain but this location is poorly run and is one of the few focused purely on profits and not on customer service/satisfaction.  I eat at chipotle at least twice a week and get the same ingredients; I know what a normal burrito looks like.  The one they made for me at this location was at least 30% smaller than any burrito I have ever had.  It was smaller than a typical taco.  When I politely asked if I could have a new burrito or just supplement with a taco the manager gave me the fifth degree about what was in the burrito and that sizes always vary.  I didn't really feel like arguing so just walked away with a poor experience and walked out the door still hungry.

Dona Kitchen serves basic Mexican street/cafe food. Tacos (mostly around $2), quesadillas, sopes, and made to order guacamole. The owners are very friendly.

I tried three tacos: asada, campechano, and carnitas. I was a little perturbed when the cashier asked if I wanted flour or corn tortillas, as I don't think flour tortillas should ever be an option for Mexican tacos. But whatever. I had mine on corn tortillas, Mexicano style (with onions and cilantro). They were served with lime wedges and my choice of spicy or mild salsa. When they were served, the server asked if I needed instruction for how to eat Mexican tacos. (!!!) She stopped herself when she watched me with the lime wedges. 

I thought the tacos were good. Not the best I've had, but solid. They needed the lime juice and salsa as they were bland otherwise. And they were served on two tortillas per taco, which is an indication of store-bought tortillas. My preference would be Taqueria Emanuel (on MacDill closer to Columbus) as they do a better job with the meat and have clearly home made tortillas. Or Loli's, if you want a fish taco. But this was not a bad option if you happen to be in this part of Tampa and crave tacos.

"So I've had drinks at Fodder & Shine with friends multiple times because the atmosphere is pretty chill, the decor is on point, and well...the bartenders put a lot of effort into making some amazing cocktails (beer selection isn't bad, either!).

The extent of my dining experience had just been a southern chicken biscuit on another late night visit, which was great and a core portion of their menu- but I finally had a full dining experience recently so I decided to drop a review.

I was told to ""order the meatloaf"" by a couple friends but this goes against one of my dining principles: I grew up on some amazing homemade meatloaf in the South and find very few restaurants get it ""right"" for me. My *main* preference is that meatloaf is topped with a ketchup-based sauce. I thought this was universal, but so many restaurants decide to top with a brown gravy...ugh. It could be a Southern thing, yet Fodder & Shine flaunts a strong Southern/soul feel. Not only that, but I also find many restaurants make a loaf and then slice each serving portion (totally understandable) but often they toss it on a griddle or heat source for too long and dry the meat out. I digress...

The menu states that the meatloaf is ""ketchup glazed"" so I'm pumped and order it. I'll be damned if it doesn't come out with brown gravy on top! I asked the waitress and she said there is a light glaze covering the meatloaf, but it's also topped with brown gravy. WHHHHYYYYYYYY? Those flavors don't go together for me personally and I couldn't taste a tomato/ketchup glaze at all.

Nonetheless, it was pretty good all own it's own but the dish was completely saved by the creamed kale and fantastic mac-n-cheese. The service was above par and as I already mentioned, the drinks are fantastic.

Social distancing is enforced and there are tables outside for those to sit at as well. Tables are wiped down between customers and staff wear masks. The restaurant was very clean and the staff attentive. 

When we arrived there was no wait and we were seated quickly. The menu is varied and there are some great selections at great prices! Our waiter recommended three things from the menu to include the steak and eggs sandwich, the strawberry stuffed French toast, and the country skillet. 

I was in the mood for savory so I went with the waiters recommendation and ordered the country skillet. I have to say out of five stars I'd rate it a 4/5. The only thing I'd improve on is a a little more gravy on the dish. Other than that it was delicious! The biscuit was so soft and fluffy! The eggs were fluffy and delicious! The potatoes were perfectly fried and tender. My only issue was there was TONS of onions but that's on me for not catching there was onions in the dish. I'd have ordered light on the onions or no onions at all. However, if you're in a savory mood I'd say go for it! 

My friend ordered the strawberry stuffed French toast special for 12.95! And she let me have a bite and it was soooo delicious! Honestly if I could have ordered like a side of that it would have perfectly complemented my savory dish. The playing was delicious and so beautiful! 

We did order the hot chocolate and while it was good, it wasn't the best hot chocolate I've ordered from a breakfast/brunch restaurant the whip cream was ok, but next time I think I'd skip on it. Though it is good to note, there are free refills on it AND you can get them to go.

"This is probably the worst experience I've had since moving to Tampa. The fact that the place was so popular confuses me, as I wouldn't give this place a second chance.

My girlfriend had some friends in town for the Coldplay concert, so we were hoping to grab something quick and cheap before the show. As that doesn't exactly describe anything by the Forum, we went to Channelside to try our luck. Sushi and Thai were out, let's go simple and try Stump's.

We were off to a terrible start when the Hostesses (plural) didn't even acknowledge we walked in. Literally we stood there for a minute, no peep from either of them, and my girlfriend decides ""maybe the hostess is up more"". At this point, we see an open table, but I stupidly suggested we do the proper thing and wait. This will be both the right and wrong thing to do.

So we go back to the hostess and they finally talk to us and say ""10-15 minutes"". This becomes a cliche out of Seinfeld as they repeat this to subsequent guests 5, 10, 15 and 20 minutes later. So yes, not only have we first been ignored, but then given a longer wait time then originally suggested.

But while we wait, we get to hear confusion in the ranks - seems a group that decided to sit outside (0 wait) haven't actually had a waiter stop by. No one also seems to be communicating what tables are open to the hostesses, so its just a cluster of problems.

Eventually we get seated, AND IT'S THE OPEN TABLE WE SAW 20 MINUTES AGO. Wow, thank you idiot hostesses, we should have just sat ourselves. And the only reason this place gets one star is our waitress. We let her know right away we want to order then and get out ASAP. And she did her best. We ordered then, got water (and even a refill) and she even delivered the checks early like we asked.

But once again, time for the problem - the food. As we wanted fast, we got the sandwiches: pulled pork, cheeseburger and for me I got the chicken sandwich.

The chicken sandwich was overcooked, and the cheddar cheese was shredded cheddar sprinkled on. My girlfriend got the pulled pork with mac and cheese. The mac and cheese tasted like Stouffer's, only not cooked long enough.

Could it get worse? It does - my girlfriend was complaining about her stomach hurting on the car ride back. Granted she's a hypochondriac, but the sounds her stomach made told me the truth. Sadly by the morning I too was feeling the effects (and actually still am).

"Tasty authentic indian food with plenty of options for meat eaters and also vegetarians.  They have a lot of indoor seating and some outdoor as well.  
They do serve halal meats in case you're wondering.   We asked our non indian waiter who apparently had never heard the term ""halal"" and had no club what it meant, but he later  confirmed it with the cooks that it's halal.  

The butter naan is disapointing because there was no butter.  You might as well get plain naan, it will taste the same as the butter naan. 

The garlic naan was declicious and had just right amount of garlic and actually seem to have more butter than the butter naan. 

The goat dishes has lots of large bones, so be prepared for that, if you haven't had goat, it's less chewy than beef or chicken and less gamey than lamb. 

Everyone at the table overall enjoyed their dishes. But be forewarned the spiceness level of the dish likely will NOT be want you wanted/ordered.   They say they offer 1-5 level spiciness, I wanted 0 spice on my navratan korma but it was more like a 2, my friend who wanted max 5 level with his goat vindaloo said it seemed more like a 3, and my other friend who wanted 3 spiceness with the butter chicken thought it tasted more like a 5. I think the cook is just going to make the dishes as spicy as he thinks it should have. 

Atmosphere is very clean, well lit, peaceful and quiet . There were only 2 other parties in the restaurant for dinner on a Thursday night, and they were seated far from us. 

Service was pleasant, but our waiter was clueless about what halal meant, he couldn't describe some of the dishes, he didn't asked if we wanted to divide up the check, and he brought a small container that didn't fit the food we were trying to bring home.",4,A,Spice Kitchen,Spice Kitchen,Spice Kitchen,4.0

"This is the worst sushi I have ever had! It is safe to assume the good reviews are from the college crowd, and let's face it. When I was in college anything that wasn't boxed or microwaved seemed amazing.

For $5 this place is an absolute steal! They were trying their hand at many different dishes so I got to try caesar salad, crawfish etoufee, a coconut curry shrimp dish, lamb, a chicken stir fry, fingerling potatoes, broccoli au gratin, chocolate mousse, and brownies.

Now this is quality food but it is to-go also so $14 is a bit high for the ""I don't feel like cooking"" nights. Probably the biggest issue though is when they ring you up you are given a bill with the suggested tips starting at 18%, if you wanted to tip less you have to select ""other"". This is take out, not full service so this makes no sense and is awkward. What this all means is you are spending at least $30 for two people.

This is my second time going to Pei Wei. The reason I didn't write a review after the first time was because I was underwhelmed and I thought it would get better with another try. 

The food is made to order and super fresh. However, there is just not one thing I ate that I was wowed by. I actually just finished my take out and looked at the left overs and decided I might as well throw it away because I probably will not eat the rest. 

I'm not saying this place is bad. According the the slew of people that was there when I picked up my food, it must have a good following. Unfortunately, I will not be one of them.

The lobby area has an open layout with lots of seating and 2 lounges off to the side.  I got to spend some time in the lounge since I arrived very early straight from a cruise long before my room was ready.  The area had a table and comfortable seating.   There is a Starbucks onsite as well as a full service restaurant.

Once my room was ready I was blown away by how nice it was.  I had a bayside view room and looking out the window was absolutely breathtaking!  The hotel room was very nice.  Very clean and spacious.  A microwave & mini fridge made it convenient for leftovers.  The highlight of the room for me was the spacious,  double door shower with the rainfall showerhead.

Every evening I went down to the lobby for the welcome reception. It included light snacks (pretzels, pita chips & tortilla chips with hummus, salsa & guac.  There were always a couple of cocktail options as well as 2-3 wines.  These were all complimentary and they had other shots & cocktail options for a small cost.

The free breakfast had lots of options.  An omelette station,  sausage links, bacon, pancakes, eggs, fresh fruit, cereal, toast, danishes, bagels & muffins.  

The pool was very nice.  Not very deep (deepest part was 4ft6), but still nice for splashing around and relaxing.  There were plenty of loungers and a few chairs and hightop tables.

"I've seen oggi for years and never got around to trying it until recently and I'm so happy I finally did. To start with it is such a cute location. It feels very rustic and charming, and if you get seated outside in between the buildings is feels as if you're somewhere outside of Tampa. The food was delicious. We started with the mozzarella wheel of the day. A good starter, and the balsamic glaze they add to the cheese and the salads are amazing. It was so delicious. The meals were also delicious. The chicken rigatoni was my favorite over the italia rustica but mostly because it was more substantial. Both meals were very delicious and comforting. We had a cannoli for dessert which could not have been a better way to finish the meal. Anyone in the Tampa area should give Oggi a try.",13,A,Oggi Italian,Oggi Italian,Oggi Italian,5.0

Location is great, ambiance was good (heads up, at 10:00 the left side turns into a club), food was fine, but the service was confusing.  The hostess was also our waitress and the bar tender which was fine if we could've gotten our drinks (water) and food (salads and kids meals) in a timely manner.

Highlights: huge portions sizes, reasonably competently made pasta with obviously fresh ingredients (the garlic bread containing actual portions of garlic cloves was a pleasant surprise). The twenty dollar a person fixed price menu seems like a good deal, though that's not what we enjoyed this evening. 

Lowlights: the salad was some kind of culinary joke, I think. The onion pieces were about three quarters of an inch thick - a slice more suited to grilling to put on a burger than to being presented raw in a salad. The Italian dressing was flavorless and somehow greasier than expected. The complimentary bread was akin to a cardboard box.

I am going with the bad first. The the consistency of great food at everyday need to bring it to customer. With that said. Our experience with the restaurants for one day is fantastic. We were there Friday buffet. That is the only best day or what we call Prime Day. 

The buffet set off day only Friday and Saturday from 1 pm to 6 pm. Friday we have visited is the best day compare to my friend went on the following day. The food at Saturday is not nearly good as to Friday buffet. The Friday buffet has Mansaf - a authentic Arab lamb dish. It was delicious. It also has bake and bbq chicken, beef, fried fish.

I really like this place for the location and the food. I went on a Friday evening. They were pretty busy and we had to wait for a table outside. I had the 2 mini burgers which I very much enjoyed but I didn't to much care for the spinach dip. It had whole pieces of spinach in it and had a bit of a watered down cheese taste. I had a mojito and have to give it a B-. It wasn't bad at all but it wasn't nothing to brag about. The service was great and the atmosphere is really nice and laid back. The weather was nice so sitting outside is a must and even though the restaurant is right along a semi busy road you don't hear the cars.

"This was the second time my boyfriend and I stopped in at Nicki's for breakfast.  We chose this restaurant because it was minutes from the Tampa Airport and had good Yelp reviews.  I forgot to check in/write a review last time, so today I thought it was my first visit until we pulled into the parking lot and remembered we had been here before.

Nicki's is a cute diner.  It was about 10am when we arrived and the restaurant was more than half full.  You can choose your seat, so there really was not anybody to greet us.  We sat in a booth and waited a while before a server came to our table to take our drink order.  Since we had been waiting a while, we placed our drink and food order at the same time.

The food did not take long to arrive.  We ordered our standard breakfast order--egg white Western omelet with hash browns for me and corned beef hash with eggs over easy and hash browns for him.  The food was fine.  The omelet was a bit on the small side and the hash browns were quite greasy.  The best part of my breakfast was the side of homemade white bread.  

I would rate my experience higher but the service was just lacking.  Our server never returned to our table.  No refills on coffee.  It took forever to get her to bring us a check.  I think it may have been a staffing issue.  Anyways, the food was fine.

My wifei ate a veggie quesadilla and I ate a roasted turkey, avocado and chipotle pepper sandwich, both of which were also delicious.

"Pipo's has generations of experience in creating traditional Cuban cuisine here in the Tampa Bay area. The recipes have been passed down through the family, and the result is authentic favorites including roast pork, masas de puerco, roast chicken, picadillo, boliche, palomilla steak, and ropa vieja among others.

You'll find this Pipo's Café in a strip mall located along N. Dale Mabry Highway in Carrollwood. It's in the same shopping center as Carrabba's and Pet Supermarket. There's a second location down in south Tampa.

The food at Pipo's is served cafeteria style. You grab a tray and your silverware, and then walk along the line as you make your selections. They have six or seven main entrees sitting on the steam tables, or you can order a Cuban sandwich, or something else that appeals to you.

I had roast chicken with yellow rice & black beans, but you'll also see a number of House Specials, signature sandwiches and salads, and daily Chef's Specials such as their very delicious Pollo Tropical.

After paying for your meal, you pick a table in the dining area and then your server will bring you an order of warm, pressed La Segunda Cuban bread to go with your meal.

Not a hint of salt on them either and some were even slightly chewy/undercooked. The salsa was pretty watery and overall bland in my opinion. I would never order that again. Tacos came out during the time they quoted us during ordering. Three tacos came out hot and fully packed of meat, cheese, onions and cilantro!

"Started to give two stars, but the service was good, so I gave it three. This place has a lot of potential, but falls short of the mark. It was just, ""meh"". 

The only reason I found this restaurant was due to a Living Social voucher I had gotten at a steeply discounted price. Honestly, the meal was only worth about what I paid for the voucher ($10) plus the tip ($6) and nothing more. The whole place is in an airplane theme, with some really cute touches. Lots of decor and things, from the restroom sign, to the ceiling lights, and the waiting area. All really cool. But the food was really blah. 

We visited for brunch on a Sunday at 2pm. Their brunch runs until 3pm, so I made a reservation online, which upon walking into the restaurant I realized the reservation wasn't needed. They actually didn't even ask my name to look up the reservation when I told them I had one. There were a few other parties in the place, but it was mostly empty. We ordered the Southern Breakfast and the Cheesesteak Scramble. The Southern Breakfast came with homefries, and was two biscuits, country fried steak, and sausage gravy. Very interesting flavor, it was almost sweet. Nothing really spectacular, just above edible. The Cheesesteak Scramble was described as strip steak, onions, peppers, two eggs, and hash, topped with Cheese Wiz. Yeah, CHEESE WIZ. O_o  I opted to replace that with plain old swiss cheese. Mine was pretty good, once I pulled off the things they called eggs on top. I wish it were scrambled hence being called a ""scramble"". 

The bloody mary bar was impressive. Not great presentation, but they had everything under the sun available. I'm not a fan, so my man enjoyed both of ours. I asked for a mimosa, and it took a bit to get so the server comped it to me without me even complaining or asking.

I am really curious if this place is hopping on a Friday or Saturday night being so close to Cigar City Brewery, and having a ""bar"" feel. The bar area was pretty neat looking. I would also like to check out the live music acts they have on occasion. I would not go back for the food, but some of their happy hour drink choices looked great if I were already in the area.",32,C,Flight Restaurant and Lounge,Flight Restaurant and Lounge,Flight Restaurant and L0unge,3.0
"We had a reservation on a Friday evening in January. We were greeted and seated upon our arrival. The dining room is large,  open and nicely decorated. It may have been a bit to open because the room lacked warmth to me. Our server was quick to follow to take drink orders so we could get this party rolling. In fact, service was spot on throughout our entire dinner. 

I had planned on just doing the salad bar for my dinner, however they have a seafood option here so I decided to go this route. Salmon and shrimp were offered. Salmon was on par. I really don't care for farm-raised shrimp so these were not a hit for me. Next time I will only order the salad bar unless I'm craving meat. The salad bar is huge and is a gracious plenty for me with all that is included. It is still smaller than the other Brazilian Steakhouse in town. Still very good, I really enjoyed all that i tried, however this one is not as impressive as others I have seen.

I took a few college boys with me. They were in heaven with the unlimited meats. This was a hit for them and a real nice treat. 

Overall a very good experience. I will go back. Oh on a side note, right now they have a few coupons and other ways to save by checking-in on Yelp.",5,A,Terra Gaucha Brazilian Steakhouse - Tampa,Terra Gaucha Brazilian Steakhouse - Tampa,Terra Gaucha Brazilian Steakhouse - Tampa Inc.,4.0

"Say adios to Mangroves, and hello to Sunova Beach, which is the newest addition to the SoHo/Courier City bar and restaurant scene.  Why replace a bar/restaurant with another?  I'm not sure what the answer is, but just by walking into Sunova Beach, I think I know the answer; Fresh and new and beach bar, mostly beach bar.  It's the one vibe SoHo doesn't provide in it's many bars and eateries.  WoB is beer snobbish, Cheap is pseudo-swanky, Drynk is douche-baggish, MacDinton's is a fake-ass Irish pub, SoHo Saloon is small and the Lodge is a little bit of everything.

I really like what they've done with the place.  It seems more open now, and the place has definitely been brightened up.  As for the staff, we saw two people who rolled over from Mangroves at the bar, but everyone else was new--and you can tell.  A lot of the staff was lost somewhere between friendly and ""I don't know what I'm doing.""  They just opened a few days ago, so it's gonna take some time for the rookies to get settled in, I suppose.  

The bar is full liquor with beer.  In this day and age of craft beerism, I was hoping that they would have a better selection though.  I think they had about 10 lines on their rail, and they were what you'd expect to see at perhaps Applebee's.  My suggestion would be for them to rethink their selections and try to specialize in more craft beers to set themselves apart from all the other bars in the area.  I skipped the beer and had Nathan whip up an old fashioned for me.

As for the food, it was decent.  There were 4 of us and we ordered nachos and a burger to split.  The nachos were pretty good, but small.  We ordered half chicken, half steak for sampling purposes.  I think we all agreed that the chicken was better due to how well-marinated and seasoned it was.  The burger though was pretty good.  It might be the best burger in SoHo.  10 ounces of flame-grilled deliciousness.  James Joyce is still the best in town, but the burger here is a good alternative if you don't feel like traveling to Ybor.

Happy hour for drinks is daily from 3-7 PM.  As for the food menu, all but two shrimp dishes are under $10, so you won't break the bank chillin' out here.  The new indoor/outdoor bar area is great and I really like the atmosphere change to the area.",19,B,Sunova Beach,Sunova Beach,Sun0va Beach,3.0

"This good truck is about 3.5 stars. We were here after dinner and decided to try their food truck. Their taco has 4 selection- ground beef, chicken, pastor, and chorizo. The regular taco is $2.50. Is kind of above the average price. 

I got the chorizo and the pastor. I feel their meat is chop to fine. It feel like very powdery. However, I do like their toppings. They will ask you want a Mexican way or US way. I got the Mexican way. It top with cheese and sour cream. 

Tuesday, they have taco Tuesday for a dollar a piece. By then, it may be worth the price. Others than taco, they have quesadillas and burritos. May be that is better.",35,C,Los Comparres II,Los Comparres II,Los Comparres II Inc.,3.0

We opened up our salad hoping to find some reassurance, but were sadly disappointed with a half of a tiny cup of dressing for a large greek salad and a tiny black hair.

Service excellent, our waiter was Katie. Attentive yet not stopping by every 2 min. Also , we ordered jalapeño ceviche that came with plantain chips , SO good! We ate the chips right away:) and boom she brought more! It's like she was listening ;) ok , now why 3.5 stars. We ordered 7 dishes and half of them were way too salty - cannelloni ( my favorite out of all  yet too salty) , some of the olives, bread with tomatoes. Boiled octopus was a HUGE disappointment! Barely a bite of octopus and flavorless potatoes. For 15$ no no no. I order octopus everywhere I can and this was the worst. Best dishes that we liked- Serrano ham - melts in your mouth. Meat balls delicious. Jalapeño ceviche- just enough spice and freshness. Drinks- I had 2 different sangrias- Blanca and Cerveza. While interesting, traditional sangria I prefer better. Overall, I prefer restaurant Ceviche over Bulla. And we managed to spend over $100 for 2 , which I feel a bit much.

"I stopped by this Acropolis location on a Saturday afternoon for a late lunch. It was around 3:30pm and there were not many patrons to be seen. This location has a swanky interior with large white cushioned booths as well as an outdoor seating area that looks out onto Kennedy Blvd. The parking lot is not very big and you may find yourself parking on side streets if you visit during a busy time. There is one solo TV at the bar, but no surround sound if you are wanting to watch sports (Greek music only). 

I have been to several Acropolis locations and what I have always respected is the consistency in the menu items. My lunch date ordered the Samos Salmon Sandwich ($9) that he has ordered at the Ybor location because it was on point. He said this location also produced the product and flavor that  he had hoped for. I decided to try something different with the Falafel Wrap ($8) and I ordered it with a side of tzatziki sauce despite the fact that it came drizzled in tahini sauce. I'm glad I did because it was not the most well dressed and flavorful wrap on its own. There was a falafel ball on each side and the rest was mostly the tortilla and lettuce. I don't think I'd order this again. I'm a carnivore and will resort to chicken or gyro next time. Like other locations, sangria is 2-4-1 all day, every day and happy hour is 3-6pm for other selections.

The banana nut carmel waffle had so much nuts in it and was really hard to taste the waffle. I think someone accidentaly poured to much nuts. However, The stuffed raspberry french toast with cream cheese was sooo delicious! I would definitely come back for that alone. The pancake, waffle, french toast doesn't come with sides.

Bar service is terrible. Unfriendly and hard to get served even during off times of the day. Good place to come and sit to watch sports. No pressure to buy a drink because they never ask if you want anything and good luck getting another round when your glass is empty. Food was not bad but it was nothing special or at least the server describes it a being nothing special. We ordered the hummus appetizer which was okay. Nice use of sliced cucumbers. Also ordered boneless chicken app. Lightly dusted with garlic parm but it was just a dry dust and not much flavor. Glad we had the ranch dressing to dip in as that was pretty homemade tasting. I wish the service left a more positive impression because I think they don't care as if you are a captive audience by location and may not have other choices.

"This place has a great lunch buffet.  For $8.99, you get to taste all sorts of yummy comfort food.  There were three proteins available (smothered chicken, baked chicken and fried fish), and a whole lot of sides.  I tried the red beans, sweet potatoes, and collard greens.  There were also mashed potatoes, cabbage, and cornbread.

Everything tasted good.  I usually find myself needing hot sauce, but I thought the food was well-seasoned on its own.  The baked chicken was very tender, the fried fish had a very good batter (although it wasn't as crispy as I'd like).  I loved the red beans and rice.  The collards and yams were fine.

The sole waitress was friendly and kept offering me refills of my sweet tea.

"One star BC I had to give it that. What a scam!  We went to the restaurant and ordered a $12 bowl of soup. We expected to spend a couple hundred dollars easily as it advertised as a nice steakhouse!  That's rubbish!!! 

After ordering a $50 steak that my husband and I wanted to share, and two sides totaling almost $20 dollars, and two sauces to go on top of the steaks at $24, a manager comes to our table 10 minutes after ordering. We were consuming the soup and a split of champagne.  She told us that we could not share the steak and that we would have to order a second steak. We are out of town and only share food when we are out of town so that we don't waste any extras.  This also allows us to order soups and apps well as dessert. 

She spoke to me in a condescending way and everything she said was demeaning.  It made no sense that we would have to order two steaks as there is fish on the menu for $23 each person and a steak for $50!  What if we each came in table of one? Couldn't we order whatever we wanted?  

She pretty much told us that she would NOT fill our $75 food after we already ordered $30 of soup and champagne. 

I've never in my life heard this from a restaurant without a menu disclosure. Nowhere on the menu does it say any of this or that we cannot share a dish (see pics).  We planned on crème brûlée and cocktails afterwards as well.

The manager said her name was Dina/Deena. This was tonight at 7:45 pm. 

Obviously there was something else about the way my husband and I appear. Not cool. Sounds very much like our money is not good enough for them. 

Will be making sure to contact who I must as I feel completely discriminated against.   I am saddened by this and I think it says a lot for the full out act of discrimination of the manager (in pic) or owner, who she claims orders her to make all people at a table order at least one entree each.",0,A,Malio's Prime Steakhouse,Malio's Prime Steakhouse,Mali0's Prime Steakh0use,1.0

As for the food, the spinach and artichoke dip here is awesome.  It is served with crunchy pita chips but they will provide warm, grilled pita bread if you ask.  The mezze plate is one that everyone should try.  Step out a little bit and try something new with the edamame hummus!  The roasted garlic on this plate was yummy!

The building is new and the so do all the interior is new too. The menu price is at medium range. We started Tako Yaki. It come with 5 pieces to share.

May be a little salty may help. 

Our main course are the Kiwami Ramen - Tonkotsu Ramen. Good enough pieces of charshu. Very good porch egg with flavor. Their pork broth is at the light side. This is their style. I like the most is their Kiwami Torch. It is spicy king crab top with torch white tuna. Very flavorful. 

Food come out quick. Service is good. I give them an A for just open and paid attention to detail. It is about 4.5 stars restaurant. Since the quantity is is less for ramen and chicken Karage, it is 4 stars.",18,B,Kiwami Ramen and Sushi,Kiwami Ramen and Sushi,Kiwami Ramen and Sushi Inc.,4.0
"As the original first customer to order their food when it opened back in 2011.... I have to say the garlic knots were by far the high standard of what a true delicious greasy, garlicky taste should be in a bread. Even til this day, no other pizza joint has topped or met the high standard as this amazing side app has become to our knowing for ordering a pie. However, when i decided to come back and try their place again, I was a it disappointed in the knots when I tried it 5 yrs ago. But, it's still the best Knotts toucan find in the Bay Area. Maybe the standards went down alittle?? Who knows. As far as the pie goes, it's your typical NY style pizza. Nothing special. You can get the same pizza from any other pizzeria joint. Does not differentiate from other places like Eddie, Cappy's, Detroit etc. all of them has them one special pie that makes it better and it's unique to other local mom n pop shop. The pies are really thin and the red sauces are not used as much as it should be. For the price you pay on their specialty.. Pretty bad. Bc you can a better overall pie cheaper from other places with its unique style to it. Is it recommendable? Yes bc of the knots. Def. stop by for the Knotts. You'll see how they really make this their #1 seed and he showcase to cow over ho this small little pizzeria shop. Oh yeah, true NYorkers.

"The Brontosaurus Beef Rib is a fatty, salty delight.

I have a confession to make, I've gotten a lot less adventurous with food in my old (ok I'm really not that old) age. Before, I used to always get something different when I visited someplace I've been because I wanted to try something new - I was always determined to see if there was something better. Now, when I find something I love, I tend to stick with it. It's the whole why fix something that isn't broken adage. 

I've always loved the brisket at 4 Rivers. I've only gone to the one in South Tampa, but I figured it would be the same. My husband mentioned his coworker got the Brontosaurus beef rib and loved it. I struggled internally with whether I wanted to try that instead, if it was bad my day would have been ruined because I could have gotten the brisket. I tried to convince my husband to get the brisket, but he wouldn't budge from his standard chicken sandwich. I slept on it, I thought about it some more, and then I decided I would do it. (Yes, this is what takes up most of my brainpower).

I've tried the Brontosaurus Beef Rib and I can't go back. (Although, since it is $25+ my husband warned me this can't become an every day thing. Thanks, hon). First of all, it is huge! I was pregnant and did a spin class that morning so I was starved and I could only finish half. I ate an additional quarter for snack a couple hours later. Moral of the story is two people could easily share this bone of meat. I'm a huge lover of salty, fatty meat, and this satisfied those two cravings. There is so much salt and so much fat that I was in heaven. However, if you do not like salt or fat (or an overabundance of salt or fat), this is not the meat for you. My husband, who likes lean meat, would probably only eat half the meat. 

For sides, I got the cole slaw and corn. I asked which vegetables don't contain pork and, unfortunately, both the green beans and the collard greens are made with pig. I can live with that because I loved the corn and cole slaw. They were the perfect accompaniments to my hunk of meat. I think the corn is cooked with onions so it gave it a richer flavor than just corn. 

This location is so much bigger than the one in South Tampa. They have a huge dessert section, which I will have to check out another day when I'm not filled with meat. We got there at 11:30 on a Friday and there was no line. My husband got his chicken sandwich right away and it was about a ten-minute wait for my Brontosaurus Beef Rib. Basically, we were in and out in twenty minutes. 

I'm glad we don't live closer or else I would weigh 20 lbs more. I will be back for another Brontosaurus Beef Rib.",13,A,4 Rivers Smokehouse,4 Rivers Smokehouse,4 Rivers Sm0keh0use,5.0

"Meh, I went here on the universal Yelp acclaim and was a little disappointed. It could be that what I got wasn't the best choice, which is certainly likely given their extensive menu, but what I did get was missing the zip I would have liked to call it an enjoyable experience.

Firstly, they were running low on bread when I got there, because their bread delivery person did not come for some reason that day, so I couldn't get the pita sandwich I wanted. Not a problem. It happens. What I did get: Turkey,  Fjordland cheese, rye and their sauce, didn't knock me over. It was just OK. 

Also: The decor is a little odd: well-worn posters advertising cruise trips (for an elderly clientele?) and some other strange, dated mounted objects. The ambiance overall seemed a little stagnant.

"My boyfriend loves this place, and sometime I wonder if confessing his love of this place to an Asian girlfriend should be considered a personal affront.  I had a negative experience here years ago and rarely come back unless forced to by group choice, especially when I view it as elevated Panda Express. As I'm writing this reviews, I'm eating my words. I'm actually glad my boyfriend dragged me in here  for dinner the other night, as I tried to approach it with a more open mind; though never forgetting it's elevated Americanized Chinese. That is at once it's strength and weakness. While you might never find the authentic flavors of China Yuan or Yummy House, on this night, I was impressed not to find the soupy sauces so prevalent in Americanized Chinese take outs you find at every shopping center. All of the dishes we ordered were really well seasoned, not swimming in sauces, or too salty. We ordered the chicken lettuce wraps ($8) to start shared a very large Mongolian beef ($19) and a side of chili green beans ($7) which was big enough for two. It says a lot for their waitstaff training program that our trainee waiter Michael only had one hiccup (forgot my chopsticks that were taken away with my appetizer plates). Otherwise, he was on his game constantly refilling my soda before I even got to the halfway point, nor was he overly flustered when we told him about our restrictive diet: no rice, no starches, no grains, no sugars, and no booze. Yes sir, we went to an Asian restaurant and had no intention of eating rice or noodles! I really don't think that's unreasonable to do either as knowledge of food ingredients is so key with allergies so prevalent these days. You have to be able to think quickly on your feet, and if needed, make recommendations to tweak food for the customer. With the closure of the adjacent sears store, there's so much parking available now for the entrance of the westshore mall closest to P.F. Chang's.

"My husband was sweet enough to bring me here for the first time for our 2nd anniversary dinner. We were greeted by the hostess who was super sweet, acknowledging our special day, and who was chatty as she took us to a quiet table away from larger parties.

Our server, Rich, was very friendly as he explained the menu and specials to us. He had a favorite in each category he'd recommend and also acknowledged our special day. It really meant a lot that they did that!

Drinks: We started our with a cocktail each. For Cinco De Mayo my husband tried their Diablo drink special that was some mix of ginger beer, tequila, habanero pepper, and fresh lime juice. I'm never one for spicy drinks or usually tequila and it was delish! I had their Watermelon martini made from fresh water melon juice and was pleasantly delighted - light and refreshing without being oversweet from any added sugar.

Food: We tried the Kobe sliders, one each as you can get them singularly, and they melted in our mouths. For dinner my husband had their Snapper special that came with  Sweet potato mash and grilled brocollini. He also got a side salad to start. I had their Salmond salad and it was not only a generous portion of salad but the dressing - balsamic and feta - was awesome. The salmon was cooked perfectly and it was such a nice balanced meal. 

Dessert: We cheated and tried their donuts. One each: raspberry, chocolate, white chocolate, and caramel. OMG. My favorites were the raspberry and caramel - there was even homemade whipped cream that accompanied them.

"I enjoyed my visit to Pascal's. On a weekday around noon, it was nearly full, but we snagged a table inside. They also have outdoor seating on the patio, if that's more your style. 

The walls are covered in local art that you can purchase. To me, ""local art"" is hit or miss. Some of the paintings on the wall were pretty good though. They definitely made the high walls of the restaurant more intriguing.

An interesting note: we were attended by every person working that day, not just by one waiter. Two different people tried to take our order. The first had to leave mid-order to confirm pricing, and when the second person came by, two other staff flanked her until we had finished telling her what we wanted. Just a little odd. I wasn't sure if they were in training or not. Everyone was very friendly, and service was relatively speedy.

I ordered the breakfast quesadilla and added chicken (an extra $4 charge). It's definitely a big portion for one person, but I put it away like a champ. If they served it with just a little more sauce, it would be perfect. The house-made pico de gallo was really good. I'm not a fan of bell peppers, so I picked those out, but the rest added a nice acidity to the dish.

I also ordered a cappuccino, which was pretty decent, both in size and flavor. Better than average.

My dining companion ordered the chimichurri panini, and I can confirm that it was just okay after taking a bite myself. Sort of dry. Definitely in need of more sauce. I gave some of my pico de gallo to him, and he said the panini was in dire need of it. The house-made pickles that come with the sandwich are really tasty and don't taste too much like cucumbers like you'll find at a lot of places that make their own pickles.

"I like Channelside for a lot of reasons, but I have just as many criticisms.

Pros: Great location, interesting mix of businesses, festival feel. Two level open courtyard lends to wandering. Movie theater + Imax the main draw for me (plus Splitsville, which I am a huge fan of)

Cons: Does not take as much advantage of the waterfront as it could have. Stupid entry design required a retrofit that feels like the claustrophobic, grudging fix that it is. 2 Escalators - both go up only... eh. Seems stupid.

"Pipo's has generations of experience in creating traditional Cuban cuisine here in the Tampa Bay area. The recipes have been passed down through the family, and the result is authentic favorites including roast pork, masas de puerco, roast chicken, picadillo, boliche, palomilla steak, and ropa vieja among others.

You'll find this Pipo's Café in a strip mall located along N. Dale Mabry Highway in Carrollwood. It's in the same shopping center as Carrabba's and Pet Supermarket. There's a second location down in south Tampa.

The food at Pipo's is served cafeteria style. You grab a tray and your silverware, and then walk along the line as you make your selections. They have six or seven main entrees sitting on the steam tables, or you can order a Cuban sandwich, or something else that appeals to you.

I had roast chicken with yellow rice & black beans, but you'll also see a number of House Specials, signature sandwiches and salads, and daily Chef's Specials such as their very delicious Pollo Tropical.

After paying for your meal, you pick a table in the dining area and then your server will bring you an order of warm, pressed La Segunda Cuban bread to go with your meal.

After she left with her food they started to degrade her right in front of me which was just not right. I ordered my usual gyro for lunch and they never added the sauce and gave me the bottom of the bag for fries. This was basically fried little chunks of nothing. 
I then asked where the ketchup was and the owner advised me people waste ketchup so gave me a dime drop in a container.

"I've eaten here a number of times as well as have had takeout.  It's a different kind of pizza if you are used to traditional New York Style Pizza or Chicago Deep Dish.  Its a thinner crust and because of the high heat in the ovens, it's very crisp.  Usually, a part of the crust is slightly burnt.  Last night, I ordered a plain (granddaughter), cauliflower (son), and a meatball with ricotta (myself and spouse) for take out.  I actually requested that they hold baking the pies slightly since we were out on some errands.  When we showed, the pies were ready and we took them home.  The plain has that right tomato sauce...slightly tangy.  The cauliflower, although it sounds a little weird, tastes pretty good.   The meatball with ricotta was not to my taste buds.  The meatballs seem to have a little too much filler.  
On past trips to dine in, we've been able to be seated very quickly.  The staff has always been quick to respond to requests.  The pizzas have been cooked and at the table in a reasonable time.  All in all, a good experience.  Most pizza houses have what I call traditional specialities.  That means, they tend to have their versions of Hawaiian, Supreme, 4 cheese, Veggie, etc.  Here, it seems that you would have to put your own together.  The description on their specialities take a little bit of time to read because they are different.  
If you like thin somewhat hard crust pizza, try this out.  If you don't, this is probably not your place.",18,B,Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza,Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza,Anthony'sCoalFiredPizza,4.0
"Aweful!
Flyer in my hotel room and ordered seafood pizza and a meatball and cheese calzone.
Ordered no sauce in the calzone.. order came and sauce was in the calzone and the pizza was like cardboard. The ""seafood"" on the pizza was supposed to be shrimp and crab. The shrimp were the itsy bitsy shrimps the size of a dime and the crab was the imitation crap... NOT crab as advertised. I counted 29 on the extra large pizza - again, they are the size of a DIME. The ""crab"" was just over a heaping tablespoon... again, this is an extra large pizza.
I call them immediately so the driver could turn around come back and get the food and reimburse me. The girl told me she would have to get her manager and that she knows she wrote down on the calzone no sauce. A guy named Mario picked up the phone and said he's sorry he made the food he'll bring me another calzone. I said no thank you you ruined my dinner plus the pizza is absolutely awful; it's dry and there's no seafood on it and I'm not paying $20 for a piece of cardboard. He said ""Too bad, I'm in charge of the food and I'll give you a partial refund but you're not getting fully refunded just because you don't like the food"". I told him to come back and get his food I don't want it this is not meeting my expectations in any way and he hung up on me.

I will try them again in a week and hope they have their act together.  I really would like to see them succeed.

"This was our first real experience with Filipino food (we'd tasted adobo and lumpias before but nothing else) and it was a good one. The restaurant is very casual with food already prepared and ready to serve as you order. 

We wanted to taste multiple different items so opted for a couple of combos which consist of two entrees each served with rice. For the entrees we got the lechon, pork sisig, menudo and dinuguan. We also got several pork lumpia as well as bbq pork and chicken skewers. 

My favorite entrees were the sisig and the menudo. The sisig had a pickled taste which I thought was delicious and balanced well the fattiness of the pork pieces. The menudo is more like a stew, hearty and rich. The lechon (fried chunks of pork belly) were just too much fat for my liking. There was literally no meat, just pure deep fried fat. The dinuguan (pork cooked in pork blood) was definitely an acquired taste and not something I would ever have again. The lumpias were so good, not greasy or dry and were even more delicious if dipped in some vinegar. The chicken bbq skewer was better than the pork, the pork was not tender enough. 

I really wanted to try their chicken adobo but unfortunately it wasn't ready yet, we were there for lunch on a weekend. 

We also tried Filipino ice cream which is really dense and thick, not creamy. The avocado flavor was a bit bland but the ube macapuno (ube with coconut) was delicious. 

The prices were very reasonable ($8.99 and $10.99 for each combo, $4 per skewer, $2 for 3 lumpias, and $3.75 for two scoops of ice cream) and the portions were generous.

"I tried the house special, the pollo margherita after a serous debate with myself over which yummy sounding option I should pick. Seriously, everything sounded good. While I was still deciding, my friendly but very quiet waiter brought me a free light appetizer of couscous, pasta salad, and crostini. It's not something I'd normally order myself, so it was nice to be able to try it ""on the house.""

After I put in my order, the waiter dropped off a very simple romaine salad (again, included in the price of the meal) with a few shavings of cheese (I think grana padano) and a tasty house Italian dressing. The lettuce was bright green and crispy. No limp or watery elements to be found.

It wasn't long before my entree arrived. The colors were vibrant, the portion huge, and the smell enticing. My only criticism is of the marinara. It's very sweet, and I like my sauces more earthy. The chicken was pounded nice and thin and was breaded and fried perfectly. The waiter brought a shaker with extra parmesan as well, which seems to be real cheese, as they had kept it in the refrigerator. The house-made mozzarella on top was delicious! I found this dish and the appetizer to be under-salted, so if you're watching your sodium intake but love Italian food, this might be the place for you! Luckily, there is a sea salt grinder on the table for people like me.

There's also a shot of espresso included with the meal. I found it to be very watery and more like drip coffee. I've had Italian espresso, and this was nowhere close. Despite this, I had a good experience and wouldn't mind going back to try other options.

First time ordering tonight. Definitely the best Greek salad ever!!!! Calamari was great and not over cooked like most places. Linguini and clams although a little oily was delicious and loaded with clams! My boyfriend got a meatball and bacon pizza. He said the 4.00$ charge for the meatballs is a little high but it was good so no complaints. Delivery was quick too. We were expecting to wait about an hour and the driver got here in about half the time.

"STAY AWAY! If you want to have your night ruined just go here. I went here to eat last Friday night and it was beyond comprehension how bad the experience was. Each time we wanted a beer, It took at least 30 mins and 3 times asking the waiter if he was going to bring us the beer. When he finally brought it out, it was warm. The food took 1.5 hours to come out and they never even brought one of my friends his burger. It was almost comical because we asked for the burger 4 times and they still never brought it. We had to just laugh when they finally told him that it was takinging 2.5 hours because they were waiting on wings... But he ordered a burger! Not wings?!?! We asked for the check because we finally had enough and they charged us for every beer that they never brought out and the burger that they never brought out and left my friend hungry! And the waiter argued with us about the charges with was unbelievable! I really think they were all high there or something..I finally had to post this after I looked at my credit card statement and they added $5 extra as a tip!

"Change is inevitable. Cyber Takee Outee has a new owner. For the loyal regulars, you gotta a lot to adjust. 

My impression of the former CTO was impressive. The taste of his food was bold but still hold on authentic Cantonese flavor. The new owner, however, took a different path. His food is much lighter on all aspects. 

The only fact that determine whether if I should come back to CTO is how hubby's taste buds and stomach reacts to their food. Since he had been spoiled by eating Chinese food for the last two decades in China, I let him do the talk. 

His assessment is, it is not bad for an Americanized Chinese take out. Fresh ingredients and no MSG; Stir-fired vegetable was crunch and not over flowed with garlic. Reheated beef noodle tasted even better. The flavor is not as sophisticate as Chef Li, but it is not a bad alternative for Chinese take-out in case the sky falls. 

It is a standard Chinese takeout. Nothing more and noting less. Staffs are friendly and gave me the impression that they care. I glanced at the owner. He appears confident for his food. Good sign.

Chicken wings (buffalo) were not spicy at all but rather seemed like they were covered with honey.  Ordered healthy option of broccoli with chicken for my son and got fried with honey.

I was sad to see that this Place took over the oyster place, but I gave it a try.

I ordered the platter with brisket Mac and cheese and slaw. The slaw was okay. Nothing great. The Mac and cheese was actually good. 
Now the brisket Not so great. When I walked up to place my order I should have never ordered it. 
I watched them slice the brisket and struggle as they were slicing, I didn't expect them to slice it and serve it Cold 
I never had it like that before.  It was gross fatty and cold. 

I also ordered the sliders I choose the pork and chicken. I had the chimichurri sauce and also the bar b que sauce, the sauces are great, best thing. 

The sloppy mess of the sauces was just gross. The sauce was drenched so much I had a soggy mess before I could even eat it

Eaten here 3x with different experiences each time. Service was excellent all time but if I judged it one margherita pizza solely it be 5 but it may be taste thing but consistency is issue here. First time got margherita personal size it was amazing crispy and perfect seasoned. Could are two these. Next 2 times I got the la bastia spicy sausage grounded up with arugula and 3rd got sausage and green onion one. Made mistake got the bigger size both times crust was chewy kinda felt borderline  under cooked soggy for neopoliton. Flavors where good but the crust on bigger sizes bring it down a bit. My recommendation is stick to personal size for better crust experience. But flavors are interesting. Not high recommended but a try if I could it be 3 and a half for sure get that margherita pizza star of the show.,40,C,Armature Works,Armature Works,armature works,3.0

"The journey of the salmon upstream to give birth and to die is a mystery.  A magnetic compulsion. Their secret reserved only to nature and a few benjarong thai regulars.

I find myself here again summoned by the celestial events of this calendar year. I can only imagine what the nearby family might be thinking:  ""Daddy why is that man having a seizure while taking a picture of his food?""  
Foolish girl.  You are too young.  You haven't begun peel back the veils of reality.  To begin to decipher the da vinci code that they call the menu. All signs point to the ""Amazing Eggplant.""

They even have the audacity to call it amazing, reverse psychology.  They even list meats and other dishes as if there really are other options. 

Play coy and pretend to skim the menu.  Then ask for the amazing eggplant, the waitress might seem surprised, maybe exposed? ""Yes, we actually do have that."" 

Be prepared.  The creamy peanut based sauce is flavorful and savory with a slight heat. It has small crunchy tidbits that add texture. The eggplant itself has a perfectly crispy exterior that crumbles in your mouth.  The inside is steamy and juicy. The eggplants were presented carefully, laid atop a bed of vegetables forming the shape of a pyramid.  Coincidence? The apex pointing directly to pluto. Is it still a planet? Fool me once.

"Hidden little cuban cafe that serves up a good hot lunch that won't set you back a lot. They have a buffet of items set out and you can get a meat and 2 sides with a drink for under 8 bucks. They also have sandwiches and of course a good Cuban- a half Cuban and a soda is 5 bucks, and this is no small sandwich. I usually opt for one of their meats, like a chicken quarter in some kind of seasoned juices with onions...and of course, a side of black beans and rice.

While there are quite a few small Cuban and latin joints in the area, this place isn't cash only- so your plastic is welcome.

The place looks really tiny from the outside, but they actually have a decent size dining area for those looking to stay and eat. I think a lot of their business is takeout, though.

They also serve breakfast, which I have never tried.

It is definitely hidden. If you are heading south down 78th street, it would be the little cut through BEFORE the 7-11 gas station. It is located next to a small pharmacy.

"I had much higher expectations for this place after multiple friends have visited and raved about it.

I ordered ahead online to pick up. The process was very easy and prices online did reflect the actual prices of the food. After ordering, the restaurant called in verify that I did in fact know that it was on Florida Ave. I think this was due to the fact that there is another location close by with a similar name.

Upon walking in, the place seemed clean. It wasn't super busy but the girl at the register that was taking the order of the customer ran to me as soon as I got there. I thought this was rude and I could have waited until she was finished. They could have stood to have another person up front taking orders. She asked for my name twice and had a hard time finding the food order. I wasn't impressed.

The food I got hibachi style was warm. It had just come up when I got there. I got the Steak and Shrimp combination with fried rice and veggies. The steak tasted fresh and was tender but the shrimp was chewy and did not have a lot of flavor. I would not recommend the shrimp. The veggies were overcooked and lacked flavor. I purposely put no mushrooms on the order in a few places online and there were still quite a few mushrooms in the veggies. This is the large version. While the container looks pretty big, when compared to a friend who order a small version, the amount of food was very similar.

The salad was a waste of time. They could have just left that out. The dressing was questionable and the lettuce was just a handful of wet romaine thrown in a Styrofoam container.

I also got a Red Dragon Roll. When I took it out of the bag I was impressed by how much was in the container. It was a decent roll and had a pretty good taste for a quick sushi fix. It could have used some extra spicy mayo but it was tasty! The wasabi wasn't that good though. 

Also, be mindful, even if you ask online or on the phone for extra sauce doesn't mean you will get it. Look before you leave!

"Our experience at Cask wasn't great.  The atmosphere has a lot of potential but there are some kinks to work out.

First of all, the atmosphere is great.  The decor is very nice and it is a cute place to dine.  Our waiter was very nice, but I felt bad that he had to walk up and down the stairs whenever we needed anything.

On Sunday, mimosas are $5 or they do a $20 all you can drink.  I signed up for the $20 all you can drink.  At the end of the meal, when he brought our bill - I had only had 3 mimosas.  I asked if I could get a 4th so that it was worth our money and he said that he wasn't sure as the tab was already closed.  He then asked the bartender who agreed to pour us one more even though the tab was closed.  I was appreciative, but seriously - it is not that big of a deal, so either charge me $15 or give me a 4th mimosa.

Anyway, we started with chicken and waffles and fried green tomatoes.  Both were fairly good.  I really liked my salad, but it came out about 10 minutes later than everyone else's food.  2 of my dining companions got biscuits and gravy and they both did not like it.

It was obvious by the color and texture of the shells that they had not been prepared correctly. Nearly raw, in desperate need of a pan toasting. Annoying but forgiveable. Not to be deterred, I grabbed a fork and went to town. 

Whatever I was eating was nothing like any pastor I had ever had. Certainly nowhere in the realm of Loli's! It was a sloppy, bland mess of shredded (?) protein with not even a hint of pineapple. I ate one and trashed the other two.

Neither of my kids finished theirs either. Both complained they were not good!

I gave two stars because the horchata rocked, otherwise this trip was an utter disappointment.",7,A,Taco Bus,Taco Bus,Taco Bus,2.0

We explained to the delivery guy (Ethan) that we wanted to pick it up instead, so he told us we'd get our delivery fee waived. She called us back with an attitude to tell us she'd waive our $4. She said it in an annoyed voice like we were cheap for not wanting to pay the delivery fee.

"Aside from feeling like I walked into a box full of lit cigarettes, I think that it is a pretty cool dive bar. It is a very unassuming place from the outside and I wouldn't have given it a second thought (since you can't see in from the outside) if I wasn't specifically looking for the place. 

The inside is surprisingly larger than I had expected and for those who are there to ""have a couple of games with their drinks"", there has to be 12 or more televisions for your viewing pleasure. As you would expect, there is sport paraphernalia all over the walls and a cool mural or two. I like the decor and ambiance (sans the perfume of yesterday's cigarettes).

My party of 2 ventured in this past Sunday and arrived just in time for the 1 o'clock games -- the place was pretty much empty so I decided that I could brave the depraved air and stay awhile. We were immediately greeted by Ashley and she was on it -- She ran down the specials for the day and got the drinks going.  After sampling a few items on tap, We started with an order of mozzarella sticks.  They were pretty average, about what you would expect from the average box-n-bake variety at your local grocer.  Next we ordered the 15 wings; I took my half hot with a side of nuclear sauce.  Hey, they told me it was hot so I was hesitant to have my wings coated.  In the end, the sauce was very good and I almost regret not having the sauce put directly on them...but the combination of the two different sauces (plus ranch) was pretty tasty.

As time went on, more folks came in to watch the games and after the 4th smoker (or so) blazed up, I couldn't handle it. Sadly, I had to leave. For as long as I could stay in there, I enjoyed my time, received good, attentive service and I thought the decor was cool.  So I give it a 4 stars.

"This is the final straw.

I don't know why I am a glutton for punishment, but the geographic convenience is likely why I have gone here first instead of another McD location that is perhaps the same distance away.

Every. Fucking. Time. Horrible service and Inaccurate orders.

This time, I ordered a chicken biscuit. But wait. Was it lunch time before 10AM? The menu was on lunch. So I asked; the order taker did not really explain and just told me to order what I think I wanted. WTF?

Next: I got my iced coffee and chicken biscuit. NO FUCKING ICE?! I didn't even notice until after I left. Livid, I called the store and spoke to a manager named Stephanie.

First off, Stephanie, don't answer by calling me sweetheart. ""That's me, sweetheart,"" when I asked for a manager. Her apology was choppy and stuttered at best, and she offered a free meal replacement.

""But you obviously need my information,"" I said.

I know it is typical of restos to take your name for a book or whatever to record who gets what, but she said, ""Sweetheart, just say it's on Stephanie and that'll be fine.""

Does McDonalds know about this at a regional or corporate level? Seriously? I do not feel comfortable doing that; it looks shady as shit.

I will not be back at this location. Ever. I should have not come back after the last time when I ordered inside the store, and the cashier was taping her long fake-ass press-on nails as if I was taking too long to look over the menu.

"Why 4 stars? Because it's a nice option for Greek in Carrollwood.

   ---   ---   ---

I've driven past Santorini quite a few times, but hadn't stopped in until recently. To be honest, the shopping center is a bit run down and I wasn't sure what to expect. But they definitely had some pretty stellar reviews, so I knew that I eventually had to hit them up. 

There was quite the level of add activity happening in the parking lot when we visited. There were people just sitting the parking lot in chairs that you'd normally see at a tailgate. Only there was no game happening - it was just a Saturday night in a strip center. We couldn't really figure out what was happening there.

But we headed inside and ordered our food. The good news is that my gyro was delicious, but the bad news is that it strongly smelled like cleaning supplies in here while we were waiting for it to be cooked. You can actually place pick-up orders here through Yelp, so that is definitely what I'll be doing next time. 

And the loaded fries were not so loaded - more like fries with some feta cheese sprinkled on top. I added some vinegar to them when I got home to spruce them up a bit. They were still tasty, but maybe the name should change to ""feta fries.""

"I never thought i'd be the person to leave a bad review, but I feel like I have to. I went in today on my lunch break and I ordered the Stir Fry bowl with chicken ($10), subbed my mushrooms for broccoli, added avocado ($1), and got the Surfer smoothie ($5). I ordered the food to go. 

I'm a 25 year old dude in a band, so i'm not one to spend $17 (after tax) on a meal, but everything sounded so good, and the cashier had great recommendations. What I received was not a $17 meal, nor even a $7 meal. 

The portion was so small, the food didn't even take up a quarter of the to go container. The rice and veggies were soggy, and everything tasted as if it were a frozen meal they had just microwaved. The additional avocado I ordered was old and soggy as well. The smoothie, while it had a good flavor, was largely separated between liquid and solid chunks, and had more of the texture of ""some green stuff in water"" than a smoothie.

"El Rico Frappe makes a pretty good ""frappe"" but I was disappointed that it didn't have a dairy base. It was just fruit, water and ice. But at least they use all natural fruit and not powders and they have a large variety of flavors. I got the guanabana (soursop), which is a superfruit that provides so many health benefits. Supposedly it prevents or slows the growth of cancer. Sign me up!  Their small size ($4) is really quite large and practically gave me brain freeze trying to finish it but it was good.  I recommend asking for a spoon because trying to conquer it with a straw is futile.

The reason why I rate them 3 stars is because the wait was quite excessive. Not just my order but also for other customers. One guy ordered a sandwich and he was waiting about a half hour for it. My frappe was about 20 minutes. Otherwise, service was friendly.  The atmosphere is lacking but it was clean.

My perspnal picks are their Cheddar Butter Burger (make sure you get SINGLE to keep calorie count low and avoid mayo- the buns are already buttered so there's enough wetness) and their Mushroom Swiss single...add carmelized onions. Pair with a side of coleslaw for a more well rounded meal and get unsweetened tea. When on a cheat day, I adore the cheddar cheese curds. Crispy outside, melty inside just how I like it!

The pancakes were ok...nothing special. I got the banana nut ones and it was basically regular pancakes with some nuts on it.

The service was awful. I have never walked out of a restaurant before but I seriously contemplated it. I don't have unrealistic expectations of servers...I've worked in the service industry for several years while in college. As a matter of fact I'm usually really understanding when things don't go well...it's not an easy job. However, there is NO excuse for all the tables (about 5) that were sat after us to order, eat, finish, pay AND leave before we even get our food. The servers excuse...pancakes take longer.

I knew this place would be worthwhile because it comes from the same quality guy that has spent years at various good spots in the early Channelside days, the original Lee Roy Selmon's and then in South Tampa. Many of the South Tampa crowd has already followed him here based on what I've seen and they haven't even done the ""official"" grand opening yet.

There's plenty of draft and bottle beer options at both the main bar and the ""sidecar bar,"" plus wine and full liquor as is to be expected. 

For you day-drinkers, their Happy Hour runs 1130am - 7pm every Monday thru Friday and I'm also hearing of some ridiculously good $2 deals on drafts and Fireball shots once the real Monday Night Football games start.

The menu features many quality choices for appetizers, salads, mac and cheese specialty dishes each day, sandwiches, fish tacos as well as tots/fries with your choice of about ten different seasonings. 

Seems like virtually everyone loves the burger here and both the meatball or meatloaf sliders made me happy as well. Not many places offer a quality brat and Station Grill features that on the menu too. Oh, and the house made ranch sauce that comes with the chicken tenders, jalapeño bottle caps or friend avocado bites is a signature item in its own right. Just ask for a taste and you'll see what I mean.

Easy place to drink and/or eat and/or chill and/or watch the Rays or upcoming college or pro football from virtually anywhere indoors or outdoors at the bar or any table. There are 15 tables inside and about ten tables outside and nice girls working all over the place.

Especially on these hot Florida days. Those sad feelings melted away with my very first bite at Sweet Soul. I ordered the soft serve bowl with the matcha and vanilla charcoal swirl. The matcha soft serve definitely has the matcha flavor to it (which I love...definitely tastes like they use actual matcha powder) so if you are not a fan of matcha and want soft serve go with the charcoal vanilla, it is delicious but much more neutral in flavor. Both are super creamy, decadent, and made with a coconut milk base. It's like eating a true soft serve. Sweet Soul is very generous with the amount of toppings you get for the price. I got blueberries, dark chocolate, pineapple, maple granola, coconuts shreds, and agave. All for only $8!!! And this bowl is massive. The fruit was ripe and delicious.

"The woman on the phone was friendly and helpful. After reading online reviews from other delivery places that had poor delivery service, I checked this place out.  She promised 45 minutes and eventhough our hotel was .5 mile past their perimeter, she said they would take care of us. 

We ordered a large pepperoni and mushroom pizza and fettuccine Alfredo. The pizza was great, good crust. The pasta was good too.  It was weird that we got a half loaf of wheat bread though.  And although she promised to pack plates and silverware, she had forgotten.  Otherwise, not a bad outfit.",35,C,Oregano Pizza & Pasta,Oregano Pizza & Pasta,Oreg@no Pizz@ & P@st@,4.0
"This was my first time here, my family's second. They originally came on a Thursday night, had great food & enjoyed themselves. Of course, my kids were anxious to return. I gave in because it was a long holiday weekend & we had tortured them by going out boating most of the time & the day was weirdly chilly & rainy. 

Taking into account it was Sunday, the place was packed. Line out the door packed. We were able to skip the line because we already had play cards & wanted to eat first. 

Advised there was an hour wait for a table, ok. Went to play games. Husband went to grab us some drinks. Bartenders refuse to sell him a second drink unless I'm there with him. Um...I'm chasing the kids around the arcade, duh. And we are almost 40, not young hipsters, give it a rest. He has to get back in the drink rotation line once he reaches me & brings me over, ok. 

Checked back at the hour mark & told it would be 20 more minutes, ok. 

Finally seated, no one comes to serve us. After 20 minutes a very kind young man asks if we have been served & explains that he isn't our server, but he would happily take our order. (No other person changed with him so, i guess he became our server after that. Finders keepers, or something.)

20 more minutes pass, no drinks. The machine didn't send our order to the bar. Kids drinks come, but they aren't quite what we ordered for them, but we make do. 
Place our food order. 

Alcohol arrives. And more alcohol arrives. Apparently now the machine is sending our order multiple times. My husband takes the opportunity & accepts a second one. The rest get sent back. 

Food arrives over an hour after we ordered it. We all attack it because...starvation. The server graciously acknowledged the terrible service & comps our food. That earned one star. Thank you. 

Manager comes around & apologizes for situation & gives the kids 40 coin play passes. That earned a second star. Thank you. 

Now we have to head back to the arcade to use the play passes. 

I stop at the bar to order one more drink. Could a bartender crack a smile? They all look dreadfully miserable, as if it's their last day on Earth. 

Overall advice:
1. Wait to go until they get all the kinks worked out. 
2. Go on a weekday if you can. 
3. This place is crazy loud. I saw a kid with ear protection & i was so jealous. 
4. Be prepared to spend A LOT of money.

"Very unclear about the concept - no real customer service, so so food and minimal atmosphere. Hmmmm.

Arrived and walked in but no one greeted, acknowledged or otherwise seemed to care we were there.

I was a first timer but fortunately another member of my party knew what to do.  Good thing because no one else who worked there noticed.

Ordered food and drink and self seated ourselves.  Went to the condiments bar. Ho hum. Ketchup, mustard and mayo. Nothing else that would introduce any zest or spice.

Got our meals. Burgers a little on the modest size. Big pile of fries but they were just sorta ok.  Not hot, not crunchy and not well seasoned.

One person ordered the fries and onion ring combo. Three onion rings atop a massive pile of fries.

When a manager came over and was asked why the combo was so unbalanced in favor of fries vs. onion rings, he explained that is the corporate direction.  Three rings. Period. And he suggested ordering both fries and an order of rings next time. In other words, spend more money to get what you want. The rings are not that good and they certainly do not deserve to be ordered separately.

The server brought two orders on one metal tray.  I ate mine off of the thin, flimsy wrapper. It was good but messy and that piece of paper went soggy really fast. Here is a hint - two people, two burgers, spare a second tray please.

Too many better burger joints and too many places that really care about their customers. Burgerfi or Burgerwhy?  And those chairs? Not so comfy.",25,B,BurgerFi,BurgerFi,Burger,1.0

"Currently one of my favorite places to go when I want sushi at a good deal.  This place used to be on cypress but they relocated and changed/added to their name.

I usually go for the buffet they have, which has sushi roll, nigiri, some sashimi, chiraishi, korean dishes, peel it yourself shrimps,  and the teppanyaki, which is very good.   It's about $15 at night a little more if you order drinks.  

If you order off the menu there the traditional items like bulgogi, korean bbq, noodles.  I usually get the bbq or junbo(not sure if I spelled that right) it's a noodle in a spicy soup with lots of veggies and seafood, great when it's cold, like how it is around now.  The noodle soup isn't actually on the menu anymore, you just tell them and they know.  Sometimes I get the tofu soup, mix of tofu and veggies in spicy soup.

The service actually got better than when they first open in the new location.  The waiters now smile a lot more and speaks English.

The prices are the usual ones you see at korean/japanese restaurant ranging from $5-$60.  The portion isn't that bad.

This time we walked in to a big crowd, which isn't abnormal. We were able to get a table pretty easily. When we went up to get food they were low on plates and had no clean bowls out. They were also out of a lot of food. The few pieces of ""cheese bread"" were overcooked and dried out. They had a few slices of random pizzas left and only had a few brownies out for desert.
We grabbed what we could and sat down to wait.
They were pretty slow with putting more food out which was a little disappointing, and because it was so busy it was gone within another moment or two.
My sister went up to ask for an alfredo pizza, and in the past they typically give you a number and bring you the pizza - or at least a few slices.
Well this time they didn't even say anything, my sister noticed it was up there after people had already been taking some so she only ended up with two pieces.

"I was excited to see this food truck outside of my office in New Tampa since it can save quite a bit of time and hassle of out of grabbing lunch from one of the many nearby restaurants.

Unfortunately, the experience did not quite meet my expectations.  The woman who took my order was a little rude.  The gentleman who ordered right before me had the same name as me.  So when she asked what my name was, I paused to think of a variation of mine or just a different name alltogether (to save her, myself, and the other gentleman the hassle of being confused when they call your name out to let you know your order is ready)..after no longer than a seconds pause, the woman repeated herself in a very condescending tone, ""your naaaammee??!!  

Needless to say, she didn't get a tip after that.  It was completely uncalled for.

The food itself tasted quite good.  I got the loaded grilled cheese.  It was ready in just about 5 minutes.  The sandwich itself was a little smaller than I expected and literally had mac-n-cheese on one half of the sandwich and the BBQ pork on the other half - they should have at least been on top of each other (like in Mark P.'s 2/18/16 picture).  

Anyways, I spent $10+ (including a coke) and still left hungry.  If you don't mind overpaying for food, give it a try.

I've never left a bad review on yelp before but I had to for this place. I have been to this place a few times and each time I am disappointed. I followed their instagram and their food looks completely different on there than it doesn't when actually ordering it.

I asked the waitress if she could bring me some warm ribs and after a wait she brought another plate of three. Cold and fatty again.

"So, after almost a year of being open I'm dropping my review to 2 stars. We came back for one of their Trivia Thursdays and I'm even less impressed than I was before.

For starters, their margaritas still have little to no alcohol in them. The mix they use for their house margaritas is so tart and makes them almost undrinkable. Order an extra shot of tequila if you even want to remotely have a buzz. Someone in our party ordered a Michelob Ultra and it took 20 minutes to get to the table and it was completely warm. They replaced it with a cold one but said- ""Oh our cooler outside isn't working"". Why are you serving your customers warm beer??

I raved about the Raging Queso Burrito last time and 3 of us got it and the steak was incredibly tough. The queso wasn't even completely melted on the burrito. Someone else in our group ordered the Steak Fajitas and the steak was actually burnt black. The food prices are expensive too, the average entree price is ~$20. We asked what the difference was between the Carne Asada and the Steak Fajitas on the menu, our waitress said ""just the price"", uh what?

Services was pretty terrible, I know it was busy but with 3-4 waitresses just outside it shouldn't have been an issue.

"Wow, wow, wow....if only I had known this little gem of a pizza place was right up the road from my apartment. Ive wasted so much time ordering from domino's across the street, but now I know better. Best NY style pizza ive had since....well, the pizza I had in New york! I ordered a very simple cheese pizza and garlic knots, but the flavor blew me away. The crust/dough on the pizza is definitely quality and not styrofoam crap(ie: pizza hut crust) the pizza wasnt too greasy and I love how they are very generous with the cheese. I dont think they deliver outside of the area, so you have to live pretty close to do that. But honestly, next time I want to just go there. They do pizza by the slice which would be cheaper and more convenient for my boyfriend and I. It ended up being 23$ with the delivery but thats the total(including tip) so a little pricey for cheese pizza and knots. I cant wait to go dine in.

"I really wanted to like Sunday's. I mean I REALLLLLLY wanted to like Sunday's.  

I had the opportunity to check in on a Saturday night and then I was also scheduled for a birthday brunch the next day. 

I have two seperate events I will describe. 

First, the Saturday night adventure. We had reservations for the evening and when we arrived, there were a few tables in there but the place was not busy yet. 

We get service from a waiter who was already scattered and overwhelmed. Not sure why, as it was not very busy.  He takes our drink orders and we wait for them. And we wait for them. And we wait for them. And we wait for them.   We can see them sitting there getting watered down for like 15 minutes.   I was tempted to grab them off the bar but I wanted to see what the issue was.  Well, I would have asked HIM but he never returned.  So a female server comes to the next table.   They are complaining they ordered their cocktails about 15 mins ago and asked her if she could check on them. 

I sorta piped in from my table and stated we were also waiting for ours. 

She came back and delivered everyones drinks.  Still - our waiter is a miss. Yet I have seen take care of like 3 tables that have since come in after us and who are getting appetizers already. Us... well we haven't ordered. 

So then about 40+ minutes, he comes to us as we are done with the small bread basket and says our meals will be right up and takes our menus.   WHOA - We are WAITING for YOU to take our order. 

So table next to us is complaining and I was fed up but not rude. 

Owners lady/server comes over and is very nice and takes care of things. 

She states that since they just won Best of The Bay in CL - they were not prepared to be so busy. 

I totally understand that but then you should have stopped with the 40 other people coming in if you couldn't handle the 25 already in there. 

Food - by the time we received it was ok. Not bad, but after waiting an hour, we were scarfing it down to catch our concert. 

I had a salad. Fresh but barely any dressing. 
I had the mussels and frittes app as a dinner with the salad. Would have been decent but was fed up at that point. 

-----  So then we left.  I was apprehensive about returning the next day but owners lady/server who was very nice made sure to let me know they would be FULLY staffed the following day and she guaranteed a better experience. 

So Sunday come's....   We have a large table (about 12-14 people). I have a feeling that Dugg (review below) came in when we were there. There were actually two large parties that day. 

The wait was crazy for people who came in even tho there were plenty of tables. They couldn't handle the amount of guests. 

Food for breakfast was subpar. Overcooked eggs, greasy bacon, super hard foccaccia as the base for the benedict.   Another bad day. 

So I chalk a lot up to the place being very overwhelmed while they are experiencing growing pains.  They are not able to handle the customers that are coming in with one cook.   

I would call this place Sunday's Dining and NOT Sunday's Fine Dining until they can work out the kinks.   There were a LOT of unhappy people on both experiences. 

From other reviews, I think the place has definite potential but I just think they need to get in a groove. I MAY (or may not) try them again in a few months but for right now, I would rather go elsewhere when I am in Ybor.",2,A,Sunday's Fine Dining,Sunday's Fine Dining,Sunday's Fine Dining Inc.,1.0

"Stop in and check out this location! I noticed that all of the other Jet's locations did not have the greatest reviews and I'm not sure if it's because of the pizza or the service but the service at this location is great. I stopped in last night and got 2 pepperoni slices on the go. I have previously had a whole pizza from them but it was because the owner's dad was handing out coupons in the Walmart parking lot up the street. 

The pizza itself is delicious and flavorful. It's made in a deep dish with a yummy buttery crust. I would think it's a cross between Little Caesars (never had Little Caesars but I know they have a similar deep dish pizza) and Pizza Squared Detroit Style pizza. I'll only compare to Pizza Squared since I've had that. If you like deep dish but you don't like the reverse topping style that is detroit style pizza (sauce on top...I love it but not for everyone) then go ahead and try Jet's. If you're skeptical about the pizza itself, it's $1.87 for a decent sized square slice so it might be worth your while to try. All in all good pizza.

"When you come in ask for Justin! He is probably the most informed and attentive server I have ever had, and his suggestions are right on the money.

We came in on a Thursday and have an awesome all day happy hour, enjoy any martini or Italian cocktail for $5. I got the blueberry martini and it was delightfully sweet, which I did not expect! My mom had the Sicilian sour malfy, and found it to be smooth rather than too sour. She is not generally a gin drinker either! 

We started with the La Greca salad (not pictured). Their salads all come sized to be an entree, so we split it. 

I got the Tagliatelle Alla Bolognese. It's house made tagliatelle pasta with beef and pork meet sauce. So good, and a healthy portion too. I don't think I could have asked for more from a pasta and meat sauce. 

My mom got the Raviolli Con Ricotta A Spinaci; however at the suggestion of our server justin she got it with the Pesto Genovese sauce . Out of the two dishes we got this one was by far superior!! 

Dessert we got the Lemon Olive Oil Cake with Berries and Vanilla Cream. For something that had the texture of a pound cake it was so light. SO GOOD!! 

We will definitely be back for their Saturday all day happy hour deal, which is buy one pasta dish get one 50% off.

Although it was advertised as having a ""light"" pesto, the sauce was very creamy and heavy, completely over powering the dish.

"As always with Florida, a great find in an unassuming strip mall! Fresh bagels that rival even what you can find in NYC! The place has a clean fresh quazi-hipsterish vibe. 

For starters the staff are extremely friendly and helpful. I must have conversed with 3 different staff about various things and each of them gave great advice or solved my issue promptly.

I had to go with an iced coffee just so I could use the cool coffee cubes machine. While filling up with ice I asked an employee what her favorite flavor was. So upon her advice, I tried the caramel which was excellent! She said it tastes really good mixed with the vanilla. I opted not to try that but instead diluted the caramel with some cold brew which created the perfect leave of sweetness.  She also pointed out that they use brown sugar which helps to not fall into a diabetic coma.

For my meal I chose the lox sandwich on everything bagel. I know it's a boring choice, but it's a staple and favorite of mine. I decided to mix it up with some fresh jalapeño which was delicious.

Overall this place is great and everything is fresh! It's a great place to grab a quick Sunday brunch when other places may be packed or pretentious. 18 Bagels is casual and no nonsense.",5,A,18 Bagels Co.,18 Bagels Co.,18BagelsCo.,5.0
"Having dessert after a very poor dinner. Friends recommended we try this place. 

So first, it is pretty expensive for a milkshake, but I think it is worth the money. We ordered a mint monster bowl, a cookie dough bowl, and a Peanut Butter Bliss milkshake. $41 after tax! I'm fairness, we did get to keep the mason jar it came in. For whatever that is worth to you. 

Gotta say, the shake and ice cream were delicious and portions were generous, so you can certainly share! 

The bowls were good. Basically ice cream with a brownie or cookie dough (depends on what you order). The milkshake was creamy and delicious. Not to thick, not to thin. 

So bring your wallet, but this place is certainly worth the money. There is also limited seating, so be prepared. On a warmer day or night we probably would have sat in the outdoor seating area.",19,B,The Yard Milkshake Bar,The Yard Milkshake Bar,Th3 Yard Milkshak3 Bar,4.0

"I had some business meetings in South Tampa, and was on the hunt for a lunch spot along South Howard in between Platt and Swann. My Yelp bookmarks pointed me towards Meaner Wiener, and that's what brought me to the little strip mall that is home to this spot for gourmet hot dogs.

McDinton's is directly across the street, and Yard of Ale is about a block north, so that explains the late-night hours of Meaner Wiener (open till 4am Thursday - Saturday). For those of us who are not schnookered out of our gourd, Meaner Wiener serves up some very delicious hot dogs, sliders, specialty sandwiches, and sides in a very kitschy 80s style diner environment that is perfect for a quick lunch or dinner.

Meaner Wiener offers the classic New Yorker dog served with sauerkraut and spicy mustard, a Coney Island with chili, onions, and mustard, and a Greek dog served with strips of gyro meat, tzatziki sauce, chopped tomatoes and onions -- just to name a few of their options. I ordered my favorite Chicago dog which was the traditional Vienna beef hot dog topped with mustard, pickle spear, chopped tomatoes, onions, neon green relish, peppers, and celery salt atop a poppy-seed bun.

If you prefer a slider, they have traditional hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fish fillet burgers, and veggie burgers -- two sliders to an order. Or you can feed your tummy with one of their specialty sandwiches such as the Chicago-style Italian beef or a beef and sausage combo. For sides they have the traditional fresh-cut fries along with cheese fries, chili fries, sweet potato fries, onion straws, fried pickle chips, mozzarella sticks and so on.

The front counter of the diner is tiled in black and white subway tiles, and you'll get a great kick out of all of the classic 80s vinyl albums hanging on the walls. Lots of great vintage tunes on all of those discs. 

Stop in and enjoy your gourmet dog, and then get back to your hectic day. Meaner Wiener is a solid choice!",23,B,Meaner Wiener,Meaner Wiener,MeanerWiener,4.0

"I am positive I have reviewed Quadro before this... as I used to come here often. But according to Yelp... I haven't, so here goes!

I love Latin food... any and all types of Latin food. I also love to cook... so a good Latin grocery is always a nice place to visit. I would qualify Quadro as a generic Latin Mercado, as there is not any special emphasis on one country in the wares it offers, it offers them all! Growing up in Texas, I was exposed to a lot of Mexican cooking, and have spent a lot of time in Mexico, and Belize / Costa Rica, and Honduras.. so stores like Quadro make me happy!

Very large produce department, with some hard to find items. Huge Tomatillos for sauces, good selection of peppers, all of the usual fruits and veggies and even some Mamey Sapote (a delicious fruit). They even had some Cherimoya (another yummy fruit, which I have trouble finding. 

Lots of canned goods, coffees, spices and other items. I even found Pilancillo (Panela - Palm Sugar) to make some of my favorite cookies (Chorreadas) with... Yum! Ever had Mexican style Pecan Pralines? Addictive!

Nice frozen section... lots of yummy stuff, like the premade Arrepas I get since I am too lazy to make them. And Goya Platanos Maduros... that way I don't have to wait until the plantains I bought turn black!

Bakery is good, and seems to have a large Cuban influence. There is also a large selection of prepackaged baked goods in another aisle in the store... where I get my chocolate Maria cookies and Palmeritas. 

The meat department is why I come here... they have a lot of the usual, all at good prices! They also have some of the harder to find Latin cuts, like Brazilian Picanha (Fat capped Sirloin Cap or Rump Cap)... one of my favorite cuts of meat. They have a large number of sausages too from all over South America, and the Caribbean  (I get a Dominican Longaniza there that is delicious!). Huge selection of different Chorizos too.

Staff is very friendly, and always helpful. Again, speaking a little Spanish helps... but they always have someone on staff to assist if you need it.

Excellent store to visit for all of your Latin grocery needs.",7,A,Quadro Supermarket,Quadro Supermarket,quadro supermarket,5.0

"This Chinese take out restaurant is just okay. I recently ordered from here using Door Dash. 

I ordered two lunch platters: boneless spare ribs and General Tso's chicken. I also bought an egg drop soup, a won ton soup and a side of pork lo mein. The lunch platters come with a side of pork fried rice and a choice of egg roll or can of soda--I choose the egg roll. 

The food, overall, was good but not incredible. The rice was good and the egg roll was also good. The other times weren't anything revolutionary.

"Well.... this review is for the place - because I didn't get to actually eat there.

I showed up at 10:30 on Saturday... thats apparently when they are changing from breakfast to lunch... and a very bad time to show up to eat apparently. They were out of all the breakfast stuff I wanted, and not up and running on lunch stuff - so I was denied. *sad trombone*

The place itself is really cool. Empty lot on Florida Ave at Hillsborough that was probably a problem - now its got a hip airstream trailer and seating and really adds some life to a car dominated space. Thats a win! (Urban planner boy is happy)

"I really enjoyed this hotel. Grand Hyatt brought their ""A game"" and met all my needs. The hotel is massive with both standard rooms and villas that are near the water. The villa area with the nature walk feels more like a resort than a hotel. Unfortunately I didn't stay in a villa but fortunately my standard king room was nice and cold, clean, modern, and kept very clean by the housekeeping squad. Very beautiful views of the water depending on which type of room you select. Probably worth a couple extra bucks to get a water view because it's really pretty. The staff has a shuttle that takes people to the airport every 30 minutes and they'll even give you a lift to the onsite restaurant via golf cart if you don't feel like walking. The staff was helpful, informative, and friendly. Oh! I almost forgot, they gave me free water bottles everyday. When I checked out this morning I still had 4 unopened bottles in my room. They hook it up. Room service food definitely isn't good but I've grown to lower my expectations and anticipate receiving some less than stellar food. It wasn't terrible but it definitely wasn't memorable. Don't get room service and you should be pretty happy staying here.

"I wanted some good BBQ that I haven't tried and it didn't disappoint. Its definitely a lot nicer on the inside compared to how it looks from the outside. Its very small with about eight tables. 

I ordered the pulled chicken sandwich with a side of french fries. The sandwich was good although the chicken was a little on the dry side. I really had to add a lot of BBQ sauce to it. The french fries were very good as they came out extremely hot. 

They have three sauces. Hot, Sweet, and Tangy. The hot and sweet were very similar. Same color just different flavor obviously. The hot had a small kick and the sweet wasn't too sweet. The tangy sauce was different. It wasn't great but wasn't terrible. It had a very heavy mustard base to and it was definitely tangy. 

I do applaud them for actually leaving the BBQ sauces on the table. Most places nowadays will nickel and dime you for extra sauce but they don't.

The service was good and we didn't have to wait too long for our food. When I tried the ramen, it was WAY TOO salty! I had to dilute it with water (which made the food cold) and I didn't even put the entire soup base into my noodle bowl, thank God!

We went to check it out on a Sunday Morning around 11:30ish and had a 15-20 minute wait, considering how busy they were and that it took my honey a while to find parking this was not too bad. We were seated and our server came by to introduce himself, he was really nice and informed us he would give us a minute to look over the menu and bring us some waters. When he came back we were ready. Honey got the Omelette and added some tomato slices on the side (this is his thing). I got a platter that included eggs, bacon and pancakes. We both really wanted pancakes and didn't want to have a whole meal centered on pancakes so I opted for this platter so that he could have a pancake and I could have a few bites and get my fix. The food was good, pretty standard. I do have to say the pancakes were amazing. They were perfectly fluffy, we really enjoyed them and even commented on how yummy it was. It was a pretty uneventful visit. Our server checked on us a few times, and finally got our check and we left feeling full and satisfied.

and what the heck was in that white sauce? not sure what it was called but we ordered 3 refills of it! it tasted like a delightful combination of garlic butter & cilantro that blended perfectly with the yukka fries!

It's a flour tortilla filled with cheese, sour cream and refried beans. The one I got was ""con todo"" - scrambled eggs and chicken. I liked it minus the taste of the cheese, which I think was feta.
Service was OK. and the food came out in a decent time. The place was very clean with Latin music playing and a steady stream of customers but not crazy busy. They offer some Honduran products at the counter.

"Small sushi place in a busy strip mall on the corner of Dale Mabry and Ehrlich. It can be a little hard to find, but it's near the middle of the plaza.

The first time I came here, I had the sashimi and tempura lunch combo. While I thought the sashimi was excellent, I did not like the tempura at all. The batter was far too fluffy and soft, and not thin and crunchy.

I loved the dinner I had here there other night, though.  I started off with a refreshing bowl of seaweed salad. Then, since I wasn't in the mood for rice, I had the Seafood Sunomono appetizer.  Excellent!  Plenty of seafood, mixed with cucumber and wakame, in a crisp, sweet vinegar dressing.

Service was attentive, prices were reasonable, and I definitely will be back for the sashimi.",32,C,Kaisen Sushi,Kaisen Sushi,Kais3n Sushi,4.0
"The epitome of just okay. I went to grab a quick dinner before a movie, so I sat at the bar.

The one female bartender was in no hurry, so it took a while for her to meander over to hand me a menu. I ordered a specialty cocktail, and honestly, it was so terrible that I couldn't drink but a quarter of it. Lesson learned: just drink beer here.

The food, fortunately, was better; I really liked the tuna melt. It was served on a large toasted sub roll, but I liked it better after removing the top part of the roll. Fries were fine, if not memorable.

Another bartender had finally arrived, so I received my check quickly and was in and out of there in under 45 minutes. Will I go back?  If the same circumstances arise, then I would, but I won't go out of my way to eat here.",25,B,Tampa Joe's,Tampa Joe's,Tampa Joe's Inc.,3.0
"We tried this place when it first ""re-opened"" & it was a complete disaster! They weren't terribly busy but the service was totally lacking. We ordered a fish dish (which to our surprise was a whole fish - this was not indicated on the menu nor by our server). But it looked good & we are pretty flexible, since we love good seafood ... but unfortunately, their ""James Beard"" star chef didn't bother to remove the scales! What a mess, anyone who eats fish knows enough to remove the scales ... they took the dish off our bill & apologized, but we never went back & I don't think we ever will. Leaving scales on a fish for the customer is a huge rookie mistake, I have severe doubts about this place. It won't last just like their first venture - Senor T's. The new re-packaging won't help if the food is mediocre & the service poor. They give Mexican food a bad name - we'd rather eat at Tijuana Flats!

We had a layover for a couple hours and looked at the various restaurants in the terminal. The price seemed right and there were a lot of people there.  It's a sit down service. My wife got a Cesar salad that to me looked good but she said she wouldn't get it again.  She did like the pretzel bread one of the appetizers. It was more than I expected.  The local beers were pretty good.  My wife got the Tampa Bay beer and I got the Brown one I can't remember the name of it but I would get it again.  I noticed on the menu that the tacos I ordered didn't come with anything so I asked to make sure.  She said there was rice and beans available for an up charge  which I got.  The tacos were not as hot (warm) as they could have been but they were very good. A little on the small side.

But I do have a complaint on the chicken soft tacos. Ever since the chicken has changed it is so runny and when it's not drained it ruins the flour shells as well as the hard shells.  Once again I had to eat the stuffing without the flour shell because it was soggy and falling apart.  I love the taco Tuesday deals but I may have to stop. I don't eat beef or steak and chicken is all I get. It would be nice if you could get pork. I am attaching a picture of the liquid that was in my tacos and puddled in the container.

From the moment walking in and being greeted with a big smile from a nice woman (I had the impression she was the owner) to walking out with a fully belly I was happy.

The people behind the counter were all very pleasant (lead by the aforementioned woman) and their menu was easy to read with a lot of options.  Even when my wife asked to make a change on her sandwich it was no problem and they were thrilled to accommodate us.

While sitting and waiting for the sandwiches to be made fresh, we loved seeing the quaint decor with things that you could tell the owner was proud of... Even a quilt!

The originality of the place is very attractive.  Much more pleasant to eat in than a chain restaurant.

The whole thing built well into the crescendo of the crispy chicken served with collards and vinegary beans. Incredible. I also had the special Golden Hour cocktail which had a habanero tincture in it that gave an interesting spice to the drink. Not overwhelming, and it worked as a palate cleanser between meals.

"Rare Ethnic Food No. 21

If you have been to Asia night market especially Taiwan or China, you will find this type of food. I am glad that Temple Terrace has established this restaurant that have this capability. This is classified as a street food. They are savory and good snacks. 

We are here for snack that is close 9:00pm. They have two type fried chicken. Fried chicken fingers or chicken row. You probably understand chicken fingers. Chicken row are fried bread chicken breast and cut into pieces. This is my favorite. The breaded coating is not normal flour. It is crispy and the Chinese spice is in it. They are very good taste. 

They also have curry items. But I am interesting on their pig feet, cool tilapia, and the Szechuan Sweet pork rib. I may have to come back to try it.

Last Spring I wanted something different and noticed this place close to the campus. I enjoy a good arepa so I had to give it a try. It is in a small strip mall just minutes away from the campus. Don't let the exterior fool you. It is a small yet cute (and clean) cafe. I walked in immediately felt welcome. 

The gentleman working the counter was very friendly and helpful. I wanted to try a few things so I got the llanera arepa, beef empanada and mango juice. The sauce with the empanada was killer. So good! The empanada itself was tasty but very greasy. The arepa was bomb. It had grilled steak, avocado, queso de mano and garlic sauce. Flavor explosion in my mouth. That arepa is what brought me back the next day! I kid you not. 

I just was in Tampa earlier this week and got a couple arepas (llanera and pabellon) to go along with chicha (some sort of sweetened rice drink). The beef in the pabellon was a tad bit salty but the llanera hit the spot once again.

This last visit was simply horrific:  arrived early, understaffed, drinks at the bar took 25 minutes and they were clueless about most beverages, seats were broken, bathrooms were absolutely awful with garbage and filth  ... and the twenty year olds working there could have cared less about customers as we watched them gab on their cell phones or watch tv on the monitors.  The worst part was being stuck in a non-working reclining seat for the duration of a movie (and their electric reclining seats ARE the feature) .... only to find that a big wad of gum was left behind from the previous guest and ruined the brand new pair of black slacks I was wearing.  Not only does the staff not bother checking that seats actually work (we watched multiple patrons switch seats if they could find one that actually worked) ... but they apparently don't clean the theater very well and the big used wad of gum was all across my bottom.  The alleged theater manager that night did nothing after repeated calls and even text messages with the photograph and receipt of my new pants.

So with my one full size cake of Apple which was full price I walked out with four delicious pies all 12 slicers for $50. Service was outstanding the pies were boxed up easy to carry out .

Service was fast, friendly and efficient even when they were super busy on a Friday night during happy hour. Now as for the food - I tried the ""merica grilled cheese"" and that was probably better than my moms grilled cheese ( but don't tell her that) lol.

"We now rarely come here. 

Food here no longer makes us happy. I'm not sure if they changed their chef but the last 5 times we came here many of the dishes were sub par to bad. We ordered expensive good stuff too like Geoduck clam (prepared incorrectly and came out mushy instead of the crunchy texture. - $60 waste of a dish), steamed fish (incredibly overcooked), steak (overcooked and chewy), walnut shrimp (mostly batter), dim sum (below average now) and several other things. Our bill is always over $100 for 2-3 people during dinner and $70+ for dim sum so we order decent stuff. 

Service is down too. When the original manager was there when the place opened, the staff was great. Now 75% of the staff chats in the back much of the time. We've been here more than 20 times and spend a lot, and the owner still does not recognize us, even when we say hi.

I hurried home to share the fries, bowl and ginger miso salad with my hubby.  So I am always hesitant with poke bowls..is the salmon or tuna gonna be tasty and fresh? Well 100%..and like others have mentioned, the chunks were large. I loved the bowl as did my husband...the balance of the ingredients was lovely. I would order this again and again.  The ginger miso salad was a pleasant surprise! See all the cabbage and carrots in my pic! The fries would not be a reorder for us; we just didn't enjoy them though they were crispy even after a 15 minute drive home.

Word of advice: don't use the bathroom. Because of the location I think they share a bathroom with a neighboring business. It is far, far away down a long hallway. You're better off just holding it.

We finished the food before we could take a picture, it was too good. The beef was well seasoned and very flavorful, along with a generous portion of hummus and eggplant tahini. The chicken over rice was delicious, with fresh veg and herbs, easily can feed two people though. Delicious Turkish coffee, great way to finish the dinner.

"This was my first time I've eaten this pizza, I recently moved to this area and wanted to give it a try. I got a Margherita pizza from them and I have to say the flavors of the pizza were great. The cheese, the crust, the sauce all tasted wonderful together. My major issues were that the crust of the pizza got very soggy very fast. It was fresh out of the oven when I picked it up and by the time I got home (which only takes 10 minutes) the pizza slices were so soggy, it was like someone poured water over it and it was soaking through the box. My other issue is that since it was my first time ordering I had looked up pricing and the menu on their website. For a family size Margherita pizza it said $15.99. I was charged $17.99 when I picked this up. I thought I had been mistaken and since it was my first time there I didn't question it but all over the menu it definitely stated $15.99.

The Sesame Chicken with White Rice was also good. Like many Chinese dishes, this dish tasted better on the reheat the next day.

"My husband and I stopped by the Crepes Your Way which is next to Neiman Marcus at International Mall in Tampa. If I could give this place zero stars I would because the crepes were that horrible!  We ordered the vegetarian crepes which had disgusting frozen spinach, canned olives, canned mushroom, and hardly any mozzarella cheese and one tiny piece of a unripe tomato. It was basically a canned sliced olive crepe because the rest of the ingredients were cut in tiny pieces you could barely taste it and the ingredients were not mixed together. 

There was absolutely no taste or flavor and it was grossly put together.  There was no seasoning, no herbs and cheap quality ingredients! The crepe has balsamic vinegar on top of it which was all I could taste was the sourness of the vinegar!  When I cut into the crepe it was so thin in cut into the paper that was underneath it.  The owner had his wife and two sons working there.  The older son probably in his teens was behind the counter while his dad (The owner) was showing him how to make the crepe and the the other son around 10 years old served us the crepes, I was served my crepe first than 10 minutes later my husband got his and we were the only ones in the store. 

The owner came to our table and asked how we liked the crepes?   He noticed that the crepes were barely touched and  I told him there was no flavor and the ingredients taste like everything was out of a can and he said ""you ordered the vegetable crepe that is why it has no taste!""  I was shocked at his reaction and obviously he is not a good business person when it comes to customer service.  If that's the case than tell us next time not to order it because it is a horrible tasting crepe and save us a lot of money because the crepes were very expensive and they were horrible tasting!

Chrome rims, TVs, great paint job, clean inside and out and leather custom seats that read ""La Pelotera,"" which is Spanish for ""The Ball Player.""

As for the food, it's 90% arepas.  Venezuelan aprepas to be exact, which are the same as the Colombian apreas.  In Mexico, they've got gorditas and in Central America, they have the pupusa.  They're all very similar and only vary slightly.

We ordered two to-go.  The beef and cheese and the shrimp and cheese.  The arepas are about 8 inches in diameter and are made to order.  So becareful because they are very hot.  Of the two, my favorite was the beef and cheese.  Copious amounts of cheese (queso fresco style) and delicious shredded beef, like what you've get in ropa vieja.

We also ordered two of their hot breakfast sandwiches- an Egg and Cheese Ciabatta ($9.50) and a Sausage, Egg and Cheese Ciabatta ($11.00).

The sandwiches took about four minutes in their oven and can out hot and crisp. Overall they hade nice texture and flavor. 

However, they were embarrassingly small. I completely understand overhead and airport pricing but this was obscene. They were maybe barely the size of a small English Muffin. 

The third star is purely because of the friendliness of Marilin the employee.",40,C,Illy Coffee Shops,Illy Coffee Shops,Illy Coffee Shops Inc.,3.0

Every time I spend money here, I'm taking a chance as to whether the food will taste good this time around or not. For example, with the jollof rice, sometimes you get good ""party rice"" quality, and sometimes you get stuff that is just...bad and bland. For the prices, the quality should me more consistent.

The crowd is typically a mix of local USF kids, corporate park people from Hidden River, as well as regular old Tampa locals. There's a variety of pool hall games, such as darts, arcade basketball, and of course, pool tables.

"It was ok ...

We arrived late , nearly 7pm for dinner on a Wednesday so I wanted something quick. 
I ordered two sides... grilled potato salad and a Greek salad. 
I've never had grilled potato salad before so I figured I would go a little crazy and give it a try. It was a bit bland. The side salad was nothing special, I prefer chopped salad because cutting up all the lettuce can be such a chore. I really didn't care for the dressing at all... way to oily and very little taste. 

Next time I will order chicken kabobs... they looked and smelled amazing,  but I was to impatient to wait a few extra minutes for something that had to be cooked fresh. 

The dining room was very clean however we ate outside because the sun was down already and the risk of being cooked alive in the sweltering heat was gone... (outside dining is covered)

The staff is friendly and efficient. 

The menu is clearly marked for GF and Vegan items. I'm not sure if they offer GF pita which would be awesome to add to the menu if they don't have it already. 

I'm assuming the full meals here are hit with healthy eaters of Tampa Bay... we left at 8:00 and people were still coming in to eat... healthy/fit looking people.

I was so happy we were able to get a table and the weather was unseasonable cold for late October which was perfect for sitting outside. There are only a few tables and most of the customers are taking orders to go.

Portions were small...but it didn't matter to us, since we asked for the check after one bite.

"First time in... I order a Reuben... The guy throws a shockingly small portion of Corned Beef on the hot flat-top, cooking out any fat and tightening up the meat... He toasts the bread in a toaster and puts sauerkraut and cheese on the griddle as well... Plops the Sauerkraut and cheese on top of the Corned beef and scoops it all onto the toasted bread, unevenly, which then goes onto the press... After a couple minutes he lifts up the press for a second to check it and all I see are two pieces of toast in there... 

I paid, and they handed me the order which weighed nothing... When I took a bite in my vehicle, going by taste, the only way I knew there was Corned Beef in the sandwich was because it all pulled out as I took my first bite... The heat of the flat top turning it into rubber... All I detected was Sauerkraut...

"The Rusty Pelican is a great example of a restaurant that is successful because of its location. There are some beautiful views- but overall it felt like an upper class Applebee's. Check my reviews. It is rare that I give such a low review. Rusty Pelican slowly worked hard to earn it. 
First, we called the day before our early reservation and asked for a water view. We were told our party of 7  could not have a water view due to social distancing despite us being sat in an entirely empty dining room. That was empty for a good 45 minutes before they ended up seating all three tables in front of the window that they refused to allow us to sit at. 
The food is average. Everything drowning in sauce or cheese. I ordered the lobster tail and requested no sauce. It came basically poached in butter. The broccolini?-same. I ended up just eating the cornbread which was actually really good. My husband ordered the crab stuffed grouper (40$) and described it as average. Overall it felt like banquet food but the kind that was just ok. 
The two stars are solely given for the service. of our waitresses who were great and brought a complimentary dessert for our special occasion. But no amount of customer service could make this lackluster culinary experience worth the near 600$.",38,C,Rusty Pelican - Tampa,Rusty Pelican - Tampa,rusty pelican - tampa,2.0

It's halal which means it's super clean, no smell, no blood and trimmed of all the excess tendons and fat. The butcher takes a lot of pride in cutting, trimming and grinding the meat fresh upon your order as well. Don't worry if you don't speak Arabic, the owner is super friendly and speaks perfect English.

Drove from St. Pete (about an hour) to El Pescador. The service was very fast and our sever was very courteous. We ordered some oysters (raw and rockerfeller) for 4 as well as a few entrees. The food was fresh and delicious. Quantity and side dishes were a miss. We ordered extra tacos to top it all of. The cost for a few spicy delicacies and oysters were about $160.

Then we ordered our food and they were out of kiwi so we didn't actually get what we wanted and it came out on paper trays with plastic silver ware. This place shouldn't even exist it is just a horrible place and I will never go back. For what they are doing being in westchase things should be way classier.

"My husband and I went to brunch here recently and we really enjoyed the atmosphere and our food. 

Service: 4/5 our server was very kind and personable and our food came out hot. However, it took awhile for our drinks to be refilled and to receive our check when we were done eating. The restaurant was almost empty so it was surprising that it took awhile for these things. Overall, it was a great experience though! 

Food: My husband ordered the filet hash and I had the eggs Benedict. He devoured his hash and absolutely loved it! His eggs were a little overdone for being poached, but the meat and potatoes were seasoned and cooked well and he really enjoyed the meal. My eggs benedict was also pretty good.. the eggs were poached perfectly, the Canadian bacon was delicious, and the English muffin was perfectly toasted. However, the hollandaise was very lemony which took away from the deliciousness of the perfectly cooked Benedict and my potatoes were very over seasoned compared to my husbands. Although I wasn't very fond of the hollandaise and my potatoes were a bit overseasoned, the meal as a whole was still good and we enjoyed our experience.

"Unfortunately this restaurant was a huge disappointment. It is overpriced and done very poorly.  
Our server was MIA the entire night. We ran out of water more than once. She never came to check on us after the food came. Unfortunately the steaks were cold. Someone who I assume was the manager (he never introduced himself) came to check on us and we told him the steaks were cold. He took our steaks back into the kitchen and came back with the same ones a few minutes later. They were still cold. He told us the steaks would be over cooked if they were hot. We have eaten medium filet at several other restaurants and even made it at home, it's never cold when it's cooked properly.  He did offer to remake the steaks at that point but it seemed like a waste of high quality piece of meat so we ate the cold and under seasoned meat. The scalloped potatoes were good. For a $90 meal you are better off at iavarone's or sacred pepper or pretty much anywhere else. 
Our server 'became aware' of the cold steaks after we got the check and offered free dessert. The manager also offered free dessert. While we appreciate the effort, the overall message we got was that we expected way too much. Expecting a hot steak that was properly cooked seemed to be viewed as very unreasonable, and that it was our fault we didn't like it. 
The menu is very small and very expensive so we expected each thing we ordered to be done very well. This was not the case.

"New Bubble Tea right next to Ulta on North Dale Mabry!!  Just opened right before Thanksgiving. We just saw that they were open when visiting Ulta this evening so we went in to try it since so close to home. They have Banhi Mi (Vietnamese sandwiches), pastries and teas. The place is bright, clean and spacious. Staff is friendly and greets you when you walk in. I do have to say that if I wasn't on keto that I would've totally gotten a chocolate croissant.  I may have to cheat to try soon. Hehe. 

Ok review on tea because that's what we want for.  They don't have almond milk so that right there limited my selection. So I ordered the Jasmine Green Tea unsweetened and no boba. My daughter got the milk tea with golden boba. Our teas were out super fast!  They are served in the cutest cups with red hearts. We love the Eiffel Tower and that's the design of this place and on the cups. I'm definitely saving my cup.  The teas were good -- a good alternative to our normal spot (you'll know if you see my other check ins and reviews) however does not even meet the level for me to ever think about coming here instead of my favorite tea spot.  The milk tea was good and sweet however the golden boba was not. It's very chewy with sort of a crunch to it. I'm not a fan. Next time my daughter said she's sticking to just the milk tea by itself and my go to will be the Jasmine since they don't offer almond milk alternative. 

Diet/keto recommendation:

Order anything but milk tea and ensure it's unsweetened. Only milk tea they serve here is with whole milk only.  And stay away from all the yummy sweet goodies they also have here. 

Wish they'd offer almond milk as alternative for people that cannot consume whole milk or are on diets and cannot consume whole milk. Then I can try the Matcha milk tea :)",25,B,Banh Mi Factory,Banh Mi Factory,B@nh Mi F@ctory,3.0

Lunch buffet wise- it's my first time to see Asian or Chinese dishes in an Indian buffet, they have traditional Indian dessert and fruits, nan and dosa on top of great variety of vegetarian dishes that I probably can't pronounce half of the time. They even sell sugar cane and fresh coconut juice.  I'm kinda hooked on their awesome buffet especially long lunch hour from 11:30-3 or 3:30 and all for less than $10.

"Fat Tortillas was parked behind the Visconti Apartment complex today so I decided to give the food truck a try. I ordered the cheese quesadilla, chicken taco, and beef nachos. The quesadilla and chicken taco came with salsa and chips so we got a ton of food for $15.

The quesadilla was amazing: lots of gooey cheese and it included a side of sour cream (a certain Tijuana taco chain charges $2 for a side of sour cream so bonus points for not charging for a condiment!)

I wasn't crazy about the chicken taco. I didn't realize the chicken was going to be shredded chicken. (I should have asked.) Upon first bite, I realized the taco was cold. I think the salsa, tomatoes, and lettuce possibly reduced the chicken taco's temperature.

The nachos were great after I reheated them. (I guess you have to eat this food quickly or be prepared to reheat your food!)

Nonetheless, it was better than some of the other local pizza joints in this area, and certainly better than the big chains.

Edit: I've since been back, and the pizza tasted much better on my second visit. The employees are super friendly too (which was the case on my first visit, and I feel bad for not mentioning that!).

Past that, I have tried the wild and blazin' flavors and they are SUPER painful. Can't eat more than 1 wing at a time, and when I do, my mouth burns for awhile after and everything that I eat afterwards tastes extremely spicy. 

The BDubs in Ybor has tons of huge TVs everywhere -- great for watching sports! Also, good service... I couldn't decide which flavor I wanted (you can split your order, but you have to get a minimum of 5 wings of each flavor), so she brought out a bunch of different sauces for me to sample! Also, if you ask your server, they can give you a little machine where you can play trivia or poker with other people in the restaurant off of a TV screen.

Phenomenal rice bowl better than the world famous halal guys cart in NYC. And I literally was just in NYC. I've been here over 20 times and love getting the rice platter with beef. It is delectable. Meat is cooked fresh and just right. Sauce is perfect not too spicy but gives a nice complement. And the location may surprise you at first but it's been nothing but good people I've ran into while in line for my bowls.

"This has become my new favorite restaurant in Tampa.  Every time I have been in the place, I have had a good time.  I don't really write reviews that often any more, but I am specifically writing this one because I want to help get them some more exposure. That is how much I love the place. 

First, let's talk about the interior. Very fun. Original painting on the walls from famous trippy bands like the Beatles, the Dead, Phish, etc. I like it. You can see pictures here: https://plus.google.com/u/0/photos/113443843264033614044/albums/5773315201926066241 

Even better than the walls are the music and TV. Most places play sports or news or other stuff that I am not really interested in while eating, but CJs plays great music! The first time I came in they were playing a Phish DVD. It was awesome to walk in to a new place and hear Mocking Bird playing and then realize it was shown up on two big screens by the front. Every time I've been in, they been showing great concerts and music videos - Bowie, Tina Turner, you name it.

At this point I should say that the staff has always been great. Super pleasant, nice, accommodating, and generally fun to be around. Even if they have been new and didn't totally exactly know the answer, they were very accommodating and helpful while they found out or just found a way to make it right.

I won't say that the beer selection is vast, but it it is good. I've always been able to find some quality brew that fit my mood. In know they have wine by the glass and other drinks, but I can't really comment on that. I don't drink soda, but they have options of ice tea and my son has successfully ordered milk. Of course, if none of that is good, they have water and soda water. 

Of course, this a restaurant so you probably are interested in the food, too. (I've really just been trying to build up the suspense.) I've never been let down by the food. I try to eat lower-carb and am happy to say that there are lots of options for that. If you are a through and through BBQ purist, like from one specific county in Tennessee, then it may not pass muster, but I've enjoyed the pulled pork, skewers, salads, and other stuff. My son's hot dog and friends were above average for a kid's meal. I haven't tried the ribs, so I can't comment, but I suspect they are good.

If you've made it this far in the review, then you are probably at least a little bit interested. So I strongly encourage you to go to CJs, check it out for yourself, then click one or more of those little buttons below this review. :)",13,A,CJ's Bar-B-Skew,CJ's Bar-B-Skew,CJ's Bar-B-Skew Inc.,5.0

"If I could rate 0 stars I would. Delivery driver was extremely rude. Phone doesn't get signal in certain parts of our building.  Was advised of a 40 minute delivery time. When the driver arrived it was only 20 minutes or so, so he was a bit earlier than expected. He called to let me know but I never received a call due to poor signal but when I received the missed call 5 minutes after he pulled I immediately ran to the front door to meet him. He basically threw my food at me then threw the receipt at me to sign, cussed at me and then got in his car. We order a lot from this establishment and will NEVER order from them again.

"Awful horrible place.  We had an hour and a half for our last breakfast before heading off to the airport, plenty of time one would think.  Not here.  You have to order at the counter, pay in advance including tip, but you can see the cooks behind the counter.  It looks like a nice place, but that's oh-so-deceiving.  They have a ""breakfast all day"" sign and it's on the menu so this isn't new to them, I don't think.  An order of eggs is $3, but that doesn't include anything else, so we added grits for $3, and Cuban toast for $3.  It's a strange but simplified limited breakfast menu, which should suggest quick and easy.  The fountain drinks are self serve, the coffee is brought out, allegedly with the food, so prepaying the tip that's over $25 for breakfast.  Not a great deal but not out of the ballpark for downtown.  Fairly quickly the fried eggs over easy came out, in a plastic basket (that's not going to be easy to eat I thought) with Styrofoam bowls of something not identifiable.  The counter cashier - server asked if we needed anything else, the Chief of Staff reminded him of my toast order, and he promised it would be right out.  I was staring at the strange stuff in the Styrofoam.  It looked like the leftover rice residue in a rice steamer at the bottom the day after, or maybe three days after.  It was cold and crunchy, dry and brittle but I realized it was improperly prepared instant grits.  Instant grits, south of the Mason-Dixon line?  Isn't that a misdemeanor?  How could this have even been served to us?  We waited for my toast, thinking since that was coming right up, we could point to the instant grits that were made maybe yesterday with a quarter or less of the required water, then not heated.  And waited.
    After finishing my coffee, I took the bowls back up to the counter, waited for the cashier to finish with two customers, had to get his attention, showed him the bowls and with just a glance he agreed that they ""didn't look right,"" and took them saying ""we'll fix this and get them right back to you.""  Horrifying that they thought they could fix those two bowls, there's no fixing instant grits that were made yesterday without enough water, I interrupted and said ""how about hash browns instead? You must have those ready to go, and our eggs are going cold.""  He agreed that would be a good idea and promised once again that the food would be right out.  I reminded him of my toast order, and sat back down.  Finished my coffee.  Chief of Staff finished her Diet Coke.  Eggs cold and solid.  
    Since we seemed to have been forgotten about, I had to again go up to the counter, again wait for him to finish with customers giving orders, this time I gave him the choice, put together the breakfasts we ordered, or please give me a refund.  He once again promised the food would be right out, I reminded him that we had two orders of hash browns, our eggs were cold, and one order of Cuban toast, and even as he promised they would be right out, a cook called out to him saying ""we don't have an order for hashbrowns or toast.""  In response, the cashier gave me somebody else's toast order and promised again that the rest would be ""right out,""  I took the single toast order back and we ate our cold solid fried eggs and waited some more.  Again we were forgotten about.
    We made a big show of putting on our jackets, getting up to go, but we were totally forgotten about, so back to the counter where this time I demanded a refund for the food that they apparently never intended to serve us.  In a very insincere apology, the cashier said ""well you know, stuff happens,"" as he gave me only $3.  I raised my voice in anger as he should have been refunding me for at least the two orders of grits-hash browns and the unearned tip but really for the whole breakfast which was just inexcusably screwed up.  I wasn't using any inappropriate language, I was just recapping the history of our order and lack of service as a response to getting only a $3 refund and instead of apologizing, he actually ordered me to leave the premises!  If I had the time I would have called the police, as we were robbed.  Instead, we had a plane to catch, and on our way out, the jerk called out with a sarcastic ""Have a Nice Day!""  
   I don't know how often this sort of ""stuff happens"" here, but I was the only non-White person in the place, I'm not sure how much race played into this insulting bad service.  There are some wonderful breakfast-lunch spots just around the corner where I know I would get treated with respect, no matter what I look like.",25,B,The Loading Dock,The Loading Dock,Th3 Loading Dock,1.0

"Alright, we needed a date night and we needed some good Korean food. What better place than one of the top 5 restaurants with best outdoor seating in Tampa (this is a fact, https://www.tampabay.com/life-culture/food/2022/01/10/5-tampa-bay-restaurants-with-great-outdoor-seating/ ) Outdoor seating is important to us right now due to COVID and we want to make sure we continue to live our lives as safely as possible. 

Gangchu allows you to make reservations right through google, no need to pick up a phone. We made a quick reservation the same day, Friday at 7:30 pm, and off we went when the time came. TIP: Make sure you add where you want to be seated, otherwise they will place you at any available table. Outside is VERY nice and they have heated lamp thingies. I highly recommend you sit outside on a nice cold day (about 65 is cold in florida)

This place is casual, no need to dress up (you can if you want though). Perfect place for black ripped jeans and a nice t-shirt. The ambiance is millennial chic: neon lights, anime playing on the wall, purple back lights on a black iron and wood bar, lush plants in black planters, wood paneled outdoor patio, young people, nice club music. Overall, I loved the energy at gangchu. 

Now food, their menu is SHORT for dinner, there are about seven options total including appetizers and entree. We ordered the chili garlic wings and the korean barbecue wings (12). I did think they were a little tough and not as easy to bite off the bone as other wings, from a flavor perspective they were EXCELLENT. We ended up taking some home (air fryer at 400 for 8 minutes). For the entree, I ordered the kimchi fried rice and my husband ordered Bulgogi. I am SO HAPPY we ordered the way we did because the it appears as if it was mean to be shared. 

Bulgogi alone is just mean and a little bowl of rice. The kimchi fried rice is just rice with kimchi and veggies. I don't know how spice tolerant you are but the kimchi fried rice is about a 6/10 in my book. I mixed it with the white rice from the bulgogi and novio and I shared both plates happily. We ate the WHOLE THING, no leftovers. 

I believe they have a more varied menu for brunch, will need to try it sometime. I wish they had some of the brunch options for dinner. As this is a new place, we shall see how their menu evolves. I hope Gangchu becomes a permanent staple at seminole heights, we need more places like gangchu in Tampa.",9,A,Gangchu,Gangchu,gangchu,4.0

"I'm still diggin Grass Roots and will continue visiting. My favorite  foods are the Ramen Noodles, the BBQ Sandwich, ALL of the desserts ((key lime pie, chocolate mousse, coconut frosting cake)) and the Horchata- so fresh, so tasty. 

On Grass Roots menu it states that delivery is an option, when I asked about delivery they informed me that it is only available through another service which will charge extra-- although I'm not worried about the price, the server kept focusing on it. I travel in to Tampa on business, all of my expenses are reimbursed. If Grass Roots were more accomodating on the delivery front, I'd be sure to order every single meal of every single day from them... I hate to see they are not willing to accomodate... 

With that being said, I ordered a meal through their delivery service and as the delivery service arrived the restaurant, they were informed that what we ordered was not available. After waiting 45 minutes for our food, the delivery service calls us to inform we are not getting any food. WTF?

While I have had the guava pastries when someone brought them in to share, and liked them... I personally went there 4 times and never managed to purchase anything. Period. The owner is rude and as I was told by someone who goes there...she would be out of business if it were not be for regulars. 

2 times they were closed during a Saturday during their open hours. A third time during the weekday morning around 830 when there were about 10 on a tray. Sorry they are not available and for others as she gestured towards the people in the corner who were otherwise talking over their coffee and breakfast. Sure. You want to keep them. 

Well when will you have more, I ask. Maybe an hour or later. She has no specific time for us to come back. It was clear we weren't getting any. So we leave.

"Went to the local Chili's in Citrus Park Florida for my husbands birthday. I made them aware and was informed they sing happy birthday. Well the service was incredibly slow so we were there going on 90 min by the time we finished our entrees. The server didn't ask if we wanted dessert and just brought boxes and didn't comeback. The kiosk thing froze and the manager reset it but suddenly we wound up with a $1.99 entertainment fee for the kiosk we never even used. Finally the processed a paper check and CHARGED US THE $1.99. 

I was late for my following engagement, overpaid, and they never sung happy birthday to my husband. It was a terrible experience and I will never be back.",34,C,Chili's,Chili's,chili's,1.0

It's no Yummy House, but it also costs about one-third of what Yummy House does.  My beef with broccoli ""platter"" was cheap, plentiful, and everything seemed relatively fresh.

"3.5 Stars

Our meal got off to an odd start as we walked in and waited to be seated, per their sign.  We did not even see any employees for a good 2-3 minutes, until they all finally came out of the back.

After that it was better - we seemed to have multiple servers, but as long as they got the job done in an efficient manner, that was fine by me.  I love that their menu gave the option to get almost any dish, including soups, with tofu, vegetables, chicken, or seafood, and then priced it accordingly.

I started with the Tom Yum soup. This is a standard go-to item for me at Thai restaurants. I didn't love it; it was a pretty bland broth, not at all spicy, with hardly had any vegetables in it. I wouldn't get it again.  For my meal I enjoyed the tofu and vegetable Thai basil dish.  Nicely sized portion, with a huge variety of vegetables in it and large pieces of tofu, served with a side of perfect rice. I wish the vegetables had been cooked a touch more, as they were a bit crunchy still, but I loved the sauce they were in. Very delicate basil flavor. I had a Thai tea to drink, and it was delicious. 

The inside of the restaurant is beautifully decorated, service was efficient, food came out quickly and had good flavor, and I look forward to exploring more of their menu.",30,C,Singha Thai Viet Restaurant,Singha Thai Viet Restaurant,singha thai viet restaurant,4.0

She didn't bother to ask if we wanted carry out or delivery so we waited 40 minutes on a pizza that we could have picked up sooner. It was delivered when we were about to go pick it up. We explained to the delivery guy (Ethan) that we wanted to pick it up instead, so he told us we'd get our delivery fee waived. She called us back with an attitude to tell us she'd waive our $4. She said it in an annoyed voice like we were cheap for not wanting to pay the delivery fee. We still tipped Ethan of course but just didn't think it was fair that she didn't bother to ask and gave us such an attitude.

Sandwich was hot bread was crispy and tasty proportion of ingredients was perfect french fries were super yummy.

Then ordered a cheese pizza and the sweet tooth of our party ordered a lava cake. Pizza was actually one of the best I've had in a long time, nearly rivals my local favorite restaurant.

No popcorn chicken- ""out of it"" at speaker.
Ordered 6 piece bucket of chicken and one mashed potato bowl- $16.26!!!!!!
Waited in drive thru 11 minutes - one car ahead of me.  Finally get to the window.
I apologized for not ordering a regular mashed potato at the window, but nicely (and I'm being honest here- said please/smiled/ apologized for not ordering at the speaker) and tried to add a  mashed potato on at window- someone from the back yelled ""you can't add on at the window"" and in case I didn't hear that obnoxious voice, the cashier repeated it to me just as obnoxiously and adding- ""there's a line""- so I looked in my rear view mirror- no cars all the way back to the speaker.  So I said ""there's no one behind me"", so she rolled her eyes at me, took my credit card, and closed the window, turned her back to me and I waited an additional 4 minutes.  If she didn't still have my credit card, I would have left.
She opens the window, hands me my order, my credit card and says ""your receipt is in the bag"".  I nicely asked her ""who is your manager""- she responds- ""all the info is on the receipt"".  I ask a 2nd time not as nicely, but still politely  ""who is your manager please- was it him shouting 'no orders taken at the window?'"", and she repeats- ""the receipt is in your bag"".  The 3rd time I asked who the manager was, she literally huffed at me and said ""Chris"" or  was it ""Kris""- I don't know because it isn't written in the receipt in my bag.  After all this time waiting at the window (4+ minutes),  there is still NO ONE behind me in the drive thru.  
I'm a nurse- not in the food service industry, but if someone asked me for something nicely, I would do my utmost best to honor that request- I guess the food industry (at least at this KFC) doesn't feel the same and can afford to lose business, and KFC has lost mine forever- at this location and any other.

Chocolate on chocolate (delicious and moist cake, the chocolate icing was super light)

Strawberry vanilla (slightly bland, the icing is nice and light)
Red Velvet (delicious cake, I'm not a fan of cream cheese, but it was delicious)
Lemon (once again great icing, but slightly dry cake)

Overall opinion:
The chocolate cakes are very moist and delicious, their vanilla and other white cakes were slightly dry for us, also nothing was incredibly innovative but that may just have been the day's selection. However all of their icing is just sweet enough and so light it tasted like whipped cream.

Ordered the crawfish roll, tuna bowl, chicken teriyaki, Toro and Miso soup. Of all the dishes  only the Miso stands out. 

The Tuna Bowl was sloppy, nothing close to the bowl you get at a Ciccio Cali. The chicken teriyaki was nothing special, tasted like cafeteria food to be honest, a grilled chicken with cheap tasting teriyaki sauce. The Toro was horrible, I get that it's fatty but this was so gummy and chewy that it made it inedible.  The crawfish roll was lacking freshness and flavor.

"Why 5 stars? Because I'm truly in love with egg waffles.

   ---   ---   ---

After my first visit, I was immediately a huge fan of Snowman. I didn't think I could be any more smitten, but visit #2 hooked me even more so.

I'd been hardcore craving an egg waffle, and I actually went to another business to get it. When I arrived, I discovered, to my horror, that it had been taken off the menu. Despite still grabbing some delicious treats at said business, I still HAD to have the egg waffle. I remembered that they served them at Snowman, so we headed straight here!

Much to my delight, the egg waffle was available, and that's exactly what I ordered. I ordered the snow ice on my first visit here, so I combined my two loves during this trip: snow ice on top of an egg waffle! My dreams came true.

It was everything I'd hoped it would be. And when I say I built egg waffle desire up in my mind, I mean I was practically fantasizing about it all week. I dreamed of a life where we would grow old together. And it still lived up to the hype!

"Best Latino food in Tampa.

There are not to many places in Tampa that offer food from Costa Rica but here they have several delicious Costa Rican dishes. They also have dishes from Honduras and Colombia. The food is authentic and delicious.  Bibiana one of the servers there provided  5 Star service.

"We were in town to see the Yankees spring training game and after a long day out, we all decided that we were too tired to get into the car and drive to a restaurant.  We were staying at the Sheraton Suites Westshore, which is an awesome hotel and we thought we'd try the St. James in the lobby.

Well, it dosen't pay to be lazy, we should have drove ANYWHERE, but we ended up here.  Everything that could have been wrong was.  We had to wait 10 minutes for our table (and the restaurant was empty), our server got out orders wrong (we ordered 2 dishes, got 1 and was charged for 2) and the food was VERY BLAND.  We had our young nephews with us and they wanted a pizza.  What arrived at our table was a flat piece of dough with catsup on it.

"Two stars is mainly for the service, or I should say, lack of service.

I went to Maloney's with a group of about 10 people. We ordered food and beers and watched a game on TV while enjoying each others company. I thought the menu was really good for a bar - varied and offering something for most people including a veg burger. The selection of beers on tap was nice and the restaurant seemed clean.

My concern was with the service. No one came over to take away the empty and partially empty warm beer glasses. As a result, one partially filled glass, which had been sitting there a long while, got knocked over. After that, I took some partially-filled warm beers to the bar, which did not prompt any action on the part of the employees to get the rest off the tables. Also, no one came by to ask if we wanted anything more (after a couple of hours of watching the game) and ask if we were ready for the checks. While I understand that the server isn't watching the game, when people start going to the bar to pay up and get their credit cards back (from running a tab), it would be nice for the server to come over and ask the others if they are ready for their bills, too.

If the service is stepped up to a higher level, I would give this bar another star.",24,B,Maloney's Local Irish Pub,Maloney's Local Irish Pub,Malon3y's Local Irish Pub,2.0
"I concur with some of the other reviews that hold the menu a little weak. However, I have to say that I found the overall experience to be very good. 

The menu features a variety of Greek inspired dishes, seafood representative of the local fare, small plates, salads and soups, tempting Greek inspired appetizers and desserts, and historic cocktails from the hotels heyday. There is also a decent selection of wines and other cocktails. I wouldn't say that the menu is uninspired, as some other reviewers have. 

We ordered a cheese appetizer that was flamed with Brandy. It was delicious. Linse had a grapefruit version of Hemingway's daiquiri and I ordered a classic hotel cocktail called ""Between the Sheets"", which was fantastic. 

The house salads are good but had too much of the tasty house dressing. 

Linse ordered the spanakopita. It was a large portion and very good, although the baked potato and veggies wasn't the best option for a side. I had Shrimp a la Floridan, which was a baked combination of shrimp, onions, artichokes, mushrooms, peas, feta cheese, and shrimp -  a hotel classic dish that featured both seafood and Greek inspiration. It was delicious. 

Top of this, our server did a great job. Admittedly, her job was easy since we were the only ones in the dining room. We had an early dinner in order to catch a concert. She was polite, attentive and very knowledgeable about the hotel and the menu. 

Finally, the ambience made us feel like we were back in the 1930s. The large windows, artistic ceiling, chandeliers, oversized leather chairs - all provided an atmosphere that is different from the everyday experience. 

If you dying here, ask for a print out of the history of the hotel. Part of any good dining experience is understanding where you are in time and place.",10,A,Floridan Lounge,Floridan Lounge,Fl0ridan L0unge,4.0
"So yet another complete disaster. Wife goes through drive thru to order some food. She gets home and the order is incorrect.  There is no receipt in the bag so she calls the Taco Bell and gets pushback that they don't give receipts because of Covid and that the manager made the order correctly.  Manager ask for the total paid to ""look for the receipt"".  Obviously you're not going to remember that off the bat. 

So I decide to drive down there to resolve the issue. By then we had identified the amount since it was paid via card.  I get down here and ask to speak to a manager.  They immediately knew I was connected to my wife from the earlier call as I could hear them make some comments in the back.  The manager immediately says,""I made the order right.""  I tell her to stop because all I'm asking for is the receipt. Since that's the ONLY way to tell if the order was correct or not.  I give her the amount, she does a cursory look and days oh its not in the system since its been too long.  That's BS since they report all transactions to corporate.  She says she isn't going to replace anything or do anything else and walks away from.me.  I ask her for the corporate number and she just says it nonchalantly as she walks away. 

I call corporate and while I'm on hold other customers come in.  Realize one employee IS NOT wearing a mask so obe customer just walked out because of it.  When I get corporate on the line and. I call out to the employees for interaction and they ignored me...all while corporate could hear the interaction.  Finally the two at drive thru have a side whisper and one walks over to me so I ask for the managers name. He tells me out loud while corporate is on the line that he could not give it to me.

At this point, I'll have to wait for the GM to explain why I was treated poorly and how so many corporate rules were broken and whatbthey are going to do to fix the issue. I would NOT recommend this Taco Bell to anyone and would give ZERO stars if I could.",28,C,Taco Bell,Taco Bell,Taco B3ll,1.0
"Yum! I've lived in Tampa for 5 years and have, until now, never been to Lee Roy Selmon's! I'm kicking myself for not trying this place sooner, although it's probably a good thing since they don't exactly serve up healthy fare. 

The husband and I ordered cheese fries as an appetizer, because if you put cheese fries on your menu, I will eat them. End of story. And they were the shit. The smoky bacon ranch dipping sauce that they came with was insane!!

For our entrees, we both got the pulled pork. It was a little more fatty than I'm used to, but delicious nonetheless. I appreciated the little charred ends. Mmm. Not a huge fan of their BBQ sauce, but it did the trick. I just would have liked it to have the tiniest kick, as it's very sweet. 

I got cheese grits as a side, because I've never had grits that i've enjoyed before (literally never), so I figured I'd give them a shot. OMG THEY WERE SO GOOD! So good!!

To round out our gluttonous meal we got a peach cobbler mini dessert. The cobbler part with vanilla ice cream was delicious, but the peaches were so damn hard! Either get ripe peaches or stew the hell out of them to soften them up, but don't give me hard peaches, man. Cobbler is my favorite, so it's a big womp, womp when it's not done correctly. 

Oh, and service was awesome. Our waiter was on it, despite the fact that they were really busy and our table was surrounded by screaming brats. Wish I would have gotten his name for next time!",5,A,Lee Roy Selmon's Restaurant,Lee Roy Selmon's Restaurant,Lee Roy Selmon's Restaurant Inc.,4.0

"Wow, probably some of the best cupcakes I've had since I moved to Tampa. 

I stopped by when these guys came to Flicks and Food Trucks and had heard their desserts were awesome. Being someone that loves desserts, I had to give them a try. Looking at the menu, I noticed they had some more unusual flavors. Chai tea and honey? Hmmm. Sounds interesting.

So, I got the chai tea and honey cupcake with cream cheese frosting. And since I initially couldn't decide between that flavor and the chocolate caramel, I obviously got both. 

The chai tea cupcake was amazing. Perfect spice cake flavor and the cream cheese frosting was rich and perfectly creamy. 

The chocolate caramel cupcake was good as well. The cake itself was moist and chocolatey, and the buttercream icing was light, smooth and not too sweet.

And yes, I had both of them in the same sitting. Too tempted not to.

I'm going to be following these guys closely for sure. They had a lot of other different cupcakes too and if they're all as good as the ones I had, I'll be super pleased!",19,B,Enjoi Sweets & Company,Enjoi Sweets & Company,Enjoi Sw33ts & Company,5.0

"Don't believe the hype or what the hipsters are telling you. This place is just alright. First things first, this is suppose to be Seminole Heights first sports bar? Ok - in what way? Yes, they have a bunch of tvs playing sports including a projector playing some sports game on one of the walls. That wall is only really view-able by a couple of the low-top tables. But none of the volume for any of the sports games were on. Instead you are a prisoner to listening to satellite radio of some music station which was playing indie rock music. Heard 2 Black Keys songs for the short time eating there. Really annoying to hear this music at a ""sports"" bar. The place is also very small inside; not just for the eating section but the bar section too. You feel very cramped. And you won't get service until about 10-15 minutes after you seat yourself. Saw a few different people getting up from their table to get their own menu. Thought that was weird and not friendly

Now to the food. Not bad but not really good either. Me and my wife started off with their chicken wings. We got them breaded and with Buffalo wing sauce style. Took a very long time for them to come out and when they did, they seemed barely breaded. Didn't really have a good crunch or taste to the breading. The sauce tasted like it came from a can/bottle. The meat was tender and the wings themselves were meaty. But definitely had better wings at other places
We then wound up getting Social House's burgers. I got the Cali Burger and my wife got the Mushroom Bacon Blue Burger. I'm not 100% positive but I think the burgers are the pre-packaged kind (or frozen). Between the look of the patty and the taste, it just doesn't seem like they are not made from fresh beef, in-house. Don't get me wrong, the burgers themselves did taste good so maybe it's a high quality pre-packaged meat. But what really hurt my burger was the sourdough bread that came with my burger. I guess I should have chosen a different bun. Because the sourdough did not go well with this Cali (or probably any burger on their menu) at all. Just gave the burger a weird and odd taste. And I didn't taste any of the honey mustard that was suppose to come on it. My wife's Bacon Blue Burger was decent but very dry. And the fact that it was on a pretzel bun made it even more dry and 'bready'

Drinks are ok. The beer selection is decent. And even though we knew this before coming in, the cocktails are pre-mixed and come out of a tap. With that being said, surprisingly they weren't that bad...for being pre-mixed. 

Our server was great. The one thing that I wish Social House would not do; although this seems to be a trend with places like this, is having to pay your bill using the servers hand-held computer pad. It's super annoying and I don't see the purpose of this. It's a complete invasion of your privacy and makes most people very uncomfortable. I want to be able to look at my bill on a physical receipt. Not have to stretch your neck and squint at a computer screen all the while having your server staring at you. Same goes with tipping. It almost forces you in a very awkward and uncomfortable spot. If you have bad service and/or food then he/she has to see what you tip accordingly. Put an end to this trend.

"I was feeling a bit under the weather today and decided to have some soup for lunch. I was going to head over to Jason's Deli, but my sister suggested this Greek place in the Publix strip plaza with good Greek lemon soup. I pulled into the plaza and thought ""Famous Greek Salads? How unimaginative a name."" Then as I walk closer, I find out it's not simply ""Famous Greek Salads,"" it's ""Pappas Famous Greek Salads"" as in Pappas from Tarpon Springs where I learned that a Greek salad just isn't as good if it doesn't have a scoop of potato salad hiding under the lettuce. 
I was going to be economical and get the soup/salad combo with the house salad, but I couldn't resist the mini chop. The soup was fantastic with orzo in it. It just wish they wouldn't skimp on the chicken. The bread was light and fluffy and tasted delicious with butter. I got a hot tea for my throat which they offered with lemon or cream. The salad was fabulous. I wouldn't call it mini, but I guess it would be in comparison to the regular size. It was topped with radishes, which I never thought I liked but found that in the right situation, I could tolerate them. And oh, the potato salad. What a treat!
Another patron's gyro looked delicious. I'll have to return for a taste! Probably on a Thursday since they currently have buy one, get one 1/2 off on Thursdays. Their other weekly specials were unique too. Today (a Tuesday) they offered a free drink with the purchase of a salad or sandwich. And Mondays are mini Mondays where the mini salads are $1 off.

Agua Fresca de Pina - Pretty good but 2.50 for pineapple juice, i would not order it again

Frijoles Charros - a soup full of all kinds of piggy surprises, but it was so freaking good, i ate it as leftovers for 3 days. (Details on why it was ""left overs"" in the service description) 

Campechanas - Really really good and the pineapples add a little tang to it.  Beware of the jalapeno.  Be sure to put lime and some onions in it too. 

Al Pastor as a Burrito - my girlfriend loved it - she also added the avocado salsa for a little bit of spice. 


Service was C- and a little confusing if it's self service or not?
 
The guy was decent, attentive, but forgetful.  I also think he was new. The reason why we had left over soup is because he forgot to order soup and when I mentioned he forgot our soup, and not to worry about it, he insisted on ordering it, even after I said not to.  Also, we had to wait about 15 minutes for our check because he didn't have access to the cash drawer... 

The girl was pretty lazy and inattentive.  When i told her i needed a to-go container for the soup, she brought me a giant cup and left it at our table.  I had to pour the soup into the cup by myself which was really messy.  It's hard to pour hot soup, with chunks of pork from a full large bowl container into a cup half the diameter without making a mess and splashing. Then I had to get up 2 more times because she dissapeared to get a new large cup because the other cup was all covered in soup and also a small cup for our left over pineapple ""cooler.""   For 2.50, I'm not gonna let that go to waste!! There was still like a 1.50 worth of Juice in there!! (ha!) Then we had to wait 15 minutes for the check because we were waiting for the guy to tell the girl about our check, and then we had to wait for the girl to actually get us our check. 

Also, no one mentioned that the salsa bar was open to all patrons.  If it wasn't for Yelp, i wouldn't have known.  Thanks Yelp!

"This is a very budget friendly type of place for many of the things, but in the end you get what you pay for. The products overall are okay quality wise, the store does not keep many staffs around to help you out, it takes 15 plus minutes sometimes to find someone to help you, and these staff don't have much technical knowledge on things. The cafeteria is good and cheap but nothing there seems like it's made from scratch, for example milk for your coffee comes from the powered milk machine.

"Eating here requires me to deviate far south of my West Tampa feeding grounds.  But this is the best German food I have found so far, albeit with few choices in Tampa.  It is a small, well-lit and nicely decorated neighborhood restaurant, run by a German-born famili.  We were served by a lively, upbeat daughter, introduced to the father and advised to cooperate with the mother/head chef.    They have all the standard German dishes, schnitzels, wursts, etc. with indulgent desserts.  Since they had no alcohol license at first (maybe still) they offer free domestic or German beer....and yet their meal prices remain very reasonable.

The food was very well prepared, and they offered complimentary potato salad, very tasty slaw and bread to keep you busy while main courses were being crafted.   I use kraut, spatzele and pork jaegerschnitel as my benchmarks for German food quality and theirs were superior.  Portions were more than adequate, so we had some to take home.  But when we asked for go-boxes and dessert to go, the waitress cautioned that Mama does not allow dessert for those who do not finish their meal.....and Mama came out to discuss.  But since we agreed to take it all home and save the dessert for later, she relented.  We obeyed the rules, and the wonderful cake/dessert was even tastier later when eaten with the satisfaction of Mama's approval.

So this is a fine dining experience, but behave yourself! Mama is fully in charge.",23,B,German Bistro,German Bistro,German Bistr0,4.0

"It's definitely it's own style of pizza, and after trying it, I wonder why there aren't more Detroit style pizza joints.  I love all types of pizza:  Chicago, New York, pan, hand tossed, whatever.  Now I can add Detroit to near the top of the list.  

This place has amazing pizza.  The crust is amazing.  It's crusty, buttery, thick, but not overwhelming.  The cheese is ridiculous.  I'd say off the chain perhaps, but Guy on the food network just killed that phrase for me.  Regardless, it is some of the best I've ever had on a pizza, and LOVE that they push it out so every edge has that perfectly burnt cheese crispness to it.  The sauce is not too sweet, and on top of the cheese.  I just wish there was bit more of it, or next time I should get some extra on the side.

"Food is cheap pre-packaged generic food and the restaurant staff visibly don't respect or care about what they put out the door. Numerous times I've totalled up our order and found it much less than what we were rung up ($5.25 + $5.25 does not equal $14.50 even WITH tax). They're the closest chinese place so I gave them a few shots and the final straw came with the last order. 

I placed my order by phone and they quoted me a price of $16. Whatever, was cheap chinese and that was for 2 people. They said food would be ready in 15. Fine. We waited. 40 minutes went by and we called the restaurant, asking where our food could be. They said the driver was on her way. The place is 5 minutes away from our business. 10 minutes later, I called back to tell them our lunch break was almost up and we still hadn't gotten our lunch. The guy on the phone yelled in whatever language he speaks in then said in english ""She is on her way."" 

Our food finally got there, 50 minutes after ordering it. Considering she took 50 minutes to get our food 5 minutes down the road, I wasn't going to tip her. I gave her a $20 and she claimed she did not have change. I said fine and handed her a credit card and she started to write down my number with paper and pen. Not being in the mood to have my credit card defrauded, I gave her the $20 and am blacklisting this restaurant.",37,C,China Gate Restaurant,China Gate Restaurant,China Gate Restaurant,1.0

I was told I had to wait for fresh chicken. Which I totally get being that it was later. I asked if I could get fresh fries since I had to wait. No problem was the response. I waited about 10 minutes in the well lit parking lot and they brought my food out. I could smell the chicken. It was heavenly. Drove home which is about five minutes away. And chowed down.

"This is a fine spot to grab a burger while shopping at the International Plaza...but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here for a bite. Located in the food court of International Plaza near Chipotle, Johnny Rockets is a walk-up and order style counter serving up burgers, fries, and a handful of other items (probably a bit more limited than what you might find at an actual Johnny Rockets restaurant).   

I had the Rocket Single which came with cheese and NO condiments. They will provide ketchup packets as well as mayo packets but I was told that they do not have mustard (which may have just been on that particular day, but a bit off-putting none-the-less). The fries were just so-so; I didn't even finish them and I ALWAYS finish my fries within minutes.

I saw what appeared to be a crowd of people waiting for their orders, so I became worried that it might take a while for mine. When I asked how long it would be before my order was ready, the employee said probably about 5-10 minutes. He was right - my order was up in about 10 minutes or slightly less, but when I got my food, there were still tons of people that had been waiting since before me.

For food i got bone in wings, hot parmesan mixed. They were big wings and the flavor was right on point. 
The owner was sitting next to me talking to the bar staff and encouraging them to post on facebook. I haven't heard anything about this place except scrolling through Yelp.

It serves all kinds of food (breakfast, lunch, dinner, bakery items, etc) kinda like an ihop, but better (except the pancakes and French toast). But I ate here twice while in Tampa for a music festival and it was great. All of the plates (including the appetizer sampler) are very filling, so there is no fear of leaving hungry! For breakfast I had the chicken biscuits. Two biscuits with bacon, eggs, and potatoes were more than enough food. I gave my partner all my eggs and barely touched the potatoes, but everything tasted great. For my post festival meal at 1am I had half price apps (I forgot the hours but I *think* from 9pm-2am they have half price apps, a burger, drink, and fries for $8.99, and all you can eat pancakes for $4.99. Great late night greasy food for a good price!
I got the appetizer sampler with chicken tenders, mozzarella sticks, and French fries. Everything tasted great!

The missing star is because both times I went there, the food took a much longer than average time to come out. It seemed like at night there was only one server and in the morning there were two or three. They severely understaff, which meant that both times it took forever to have our orders taken, and forever to get our food. It definitely wasn't the servers' fault though. It looks like management doesn't like to staff well.

Otherwise, a great experience",3,A,Perkins Restaurant & Bakery,Perkins Restaurant & Bakery,Perkins Restaurant & Bakery Inc.,4.0

The roast pork was juicy and flavorful and a bit of pork skin made a crispy  and savory last few bites once I had finished my yucca and moros rice. Yum!

The restaurant is located where Olympic Cafe used to be. They haven't been at the location for very long, but hopefully they'll have a bit more signage up closer to the street soon.

There was also a nice amount of food for the price which -- as a cheap glutton -- I certainly appreciated.",31,C,Sabrosito's,Sabrosito's,Sabr0sit0's,5.0

"DOV. 08/11/14

We never go to OG unless someone else wants to, this was the case this week. We went to an early movie then they suggested OG because he has been ill and has a special diet. 

Greeted nicely and seated right away. Waited for server and she was not the friendliest in the world, for sure.  They were not busy yet but she seemed rude about wanting to rush the man who needed extra time to see what he could eat and answer questions. 

Hubby and I both got Pasta e Fagioli and Spaghetti and meatballs. Our receipt says we got salad but we got soup. She asked if we wanted cheese in soup, three said yes one no, she still grated cheese in his, had to get another one...waited for that. 
The other lady was not pleased with her Chicken and Gnocchi soup. 

The spaghetti meat sauce was not too tasty. As I said before, not our favorite place and they did not win us back with this meal.  Hope they do not end up like Macaroni Grill.

"Kabob! Kabob! Kabob!  Let Ruby Cafe and their Kabob take you on a journey of the persian delight.  This small tucked away place,  is a haven for lovers of Kabob and numerous other authentic dishes, made to order.   Ruby delivers on its promise of ""great and authentic Persian food made by Persians for all guests"".

Start with their Hummus - their serving is a extremely well balanced of taste and consistency without any overwhelming taste of tahini or tartness.  Move to the E-Shirazi a very unique salad of Onion, Cucumber, Tomato, and Mint.  Yes mint.  The marinade of sort keeps the mint well balanced to the overall taste and adds a great finish to this light yet delicious salad.  For the Kabob lover -  the Soltani is a MUST MUST have.  the marinated mesquite broiled skewered beef tenderloin is finger-licking moist with the most perfect balance of persian aroma.  Pair this with Baghali Polo (rice with lima beans) or Plain rice or Pita, and you will find yourself ordering a second serving.  The Lamb Shank is another heavenly dish at Ruby.  The perfectly  tender and aromatic mean falls off the bone with your fork paired with rice is an explosion of taste for your mouth.   The Ghormeh Sabzi (Slowly cooked cubes of beef, greens, red beans, and dried persian lemon) although very tasty may not be for the first timer of persian food.  The taste and aromas are a tab bit strong - authentic to its persian preparation.   Definitely a share and try item for new comers to this cuisine.

Ruby Cafe doesn't have any high class ambiance,  with an open layout of small number of tables and open kitchen,  Ruby doen't cater to the crowd hunting for romantic ambiance.  Ruby does surpass in its serving of superb persian food that leaves you wanting more each time.",34,C,Ruby Cafe,Ruby Cafe,Ruby Cafe,4.0

All of their burgers, whether a standard menu item or custom item, can be made on a traditional beef patty, turkey patty, or grilled chicken.  I ended up trying the jalapeno burger on a turkey patty.  

Overall, it was a decent turkey burger and even had slices of fresh jalapeno piled on top of the burger.  The fries were standard with the meal option and nothing to write home about.  Condiments are on the table, but all of the ketchup bottles around us were empty on our visit.

"The 3rd Yummy House location is pretty solid. I visited last week for a birthday dinner and it was tasty. The 3 for $22 deal is in effect, which makes dining and trying different things affordable. The Salt & Pepper Calamari was on-par with the original Yummy House. The Szechuan Pork was very tasty as well. The Sweet and Sour Pork was amazing - I wanted to lick the plate. We tried the jellyfish and it reminded me too much of slimey raw octopus (nakji) in South Korea. I'd skip it next time. The Hometown Style Rice Noodles were also underwhelming.

Service was satisfactory - the food came out quickly and there were no issues during our visit except a mishap with counting cash at the end (just separate the checks if you can). The atmosphere is not much different than the original Yummy House. There is nothing fancy about it and the parking lot honestly made me fear a little for my car and safety.

It is not a bad alternative if you get stuck with a wait at the original Yummy House, but they need to transfer the Crab Meat Fish Maw Soup and Dried Grape Duck Fried Rice over to this location for me to be a regular here.

"Pretty good. Kind of a hybrid of five guys, umami burger, and in and out. Too bad a combination of all of the above isn't better than the individual. I got a brisket burger and it wasn't that good. The beef was def better and stronger tasting, but it was almost too beefy. There wasn't enough anything else. Not enough bun, sauce, lettuce, etc. I don't like the burger to stick out a centimeter beyond the bun. They really need to put a hearty piece of lettuce and tomato on there! And a good amount of sauce. Come on now. If we want sauce then do it! I like their fries. But I'll be going back to the regular double cheeseburger from now on. 

I'm not sure what their true identity is. Overall I like it alright bc I like burgers but for some reason it's missing, what the French call, a certain ""I don't know what."" Fix the burger to bun ratio on the brisket and increase the amount of toppings and that will help. 

Btw, I called in and ordered a to go order. When i arrived 20 min later, there was a decent size line and I go straight up to an open register and say I'm here for my food. She told me I have to get in the line bc that girl was the one who took my order over the phone. And I'm like I'm not waiting in line for 10 min when my food is ready now! And she said no we will give you your food now but you have to wait in line to pay. Whaaaaaat??  I just got in the front of the line bc no freaking way am I waiting in line for my food to get cold.

"I've been looking forward to the new Apna Bazar since I found out last year that they would be opening a new location in the old Sports Authority building across Fowler. I was excited because this new location is Huuuuge. They are really giving Patel Bros. a run for their money. 

I live on the other side of town so I popped in today to get some frozen halal items along with ginger garlic paste and mustard oil. I got everything I was looking for and if it weren't a work day I would have stayed a lot longer and shopped for more new items. There is a large variety of Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi items as well as other Mid-eastern grocery items as well. I even found a few Asian items (they sell Filipino banana sauce here). There is a halal butcher in the back of the building, fresh produce and also a variety shop for non grocery trinkets that I didn't check out in my time crunch. 

As I was checking out I noticed there was a sign on the side that said ""Apna Grill."" I asked the lady checking me out about the grill and she responded with, ""it's very good."" That's all I needed. I put my bags in my SUV and came back in. I got 2 chicken samosas to go and grabbed a menu. 

I went to Kung Fu Tea to get my customary boba drink when I'm on that side of town and while I waited I ate 1 samosa. It was so good I wished I bought more. They had vegetarian and chicken available and I would have grabbed them all for dinner. It came with mango chutney and another yogurt-like tarter sauce that I'm not familiar with. When I got home I was nice enough to give the other to HubbyStanks since he said he hadn't had lunch and he was blown away by the flavor of the samosa.

When I unpacked the frozen groceries he saw that I bought frozen samosas and lamb kebabs and he was like, ""let's have that for dinner."" Ugh, these frozen samosas are not going to be as good as the ones served in the Apna Grill, for sure.

While waiting behind me in comes 1 woman and a friend . let I remind you I'm disabled and these 2 women wanted  to be seated outside. When they came back in the door they sat down at the booth that I was supposed to get. Then I was walked to the back of the restaurant. I look this time I was very upset and so I said and I started crying sad but true. Then the waitress comes over and asks if I want a coffee while she's getting the manager. I said yes for me and my friend would have a cup of coffee. The coffee gets to the table I take my spoon and go to steer it to pull the spoon out and I'm like why did they put sugar in my cup guess what it wasn't sugar it was a lid to something that had melted because of a heat to my spoon OK. The manager comes out or assistant manager Chrissy is your name and I'm crying and she looks at me with this mark on her face like a laugh kind of smoke and I said I know you must think I'm a child or a baby sitting here crying. Her reply was no I wanna buy you breakfast so you'll come back I was gonna let her do it.

"This is a tough one. It is one of the nicest pool halls I have seen. It also has big screen tv''s all along the back wall for watching any sporting event you want. I was surprised with Green Iguana across the street they didn't have better beer and wine prices. I was not there during happy Hour, so unsure of that, but from what I have been told, nothing special price wise. When I order house wine out ( and that was the only option) and don;t get at least 1/2 a glass, I have a problem, I don't care what the price is, so okay they are stingy on wine, but the bartender was great and very nice. The BBQ steak sandwich was on special for $5.00, I got that with some thing removed, making it a Philly cheese steak. It is small, like 7"" on a decent roll, NOT packed with steak, under seasoned and cheese laying on top 1/2 melted, it was small. . There were plenty of fries, they were NOT spicy, they were not greasy, they were decent fries, nothing special.
What really surprises me is the menu, it had the dumplings and eggrolls, with different Ingredients than the Iguana. They have dishes with ingredients you don't usually come across, especially in a pool hall pub, like ell sauce! I was happy to see the variety on the menu and had a hard time deciding what to eat.Since I changed their sandwich I can""t really judge it fairly, so I am not going to factor it into this review
I am very happy to find out there is another option for food and drink in that area. The menu looks very inviting and there were several thing I want to sample. The wine was okay, not bitter or anything. I hadn't played pool in years and really enjoyed it.

I hate writing bad reviews, but I'm just so upset. We brought some empanadas and a deviled crab to take home, only to throw out both. Waste of time and money when such better restaurants are down the street.",3,A,La Tropicana Cafe,La Tropicana Cafe,La Tropicana Caf3,1.0

"The first time I went I ordered the rice bowl with the Miso Love Love sauce with chicken and mean greens. Very flavorful - somewhat sweet and somewhat salty. Perfect combo. Probably the best dish I've had in Seminole Heights. I haven't been too lucky over there. The portion size is sufficient for the price. Their drink options are very limited. I had the lychee drink (tastes a little like pear if you haven't had it). Wish they had a greater selection of drinks, such as bottled green tea (UPDATE: they've added green tea and others).  They did mention that you can BYOB.

The second time I went I had the chop sauce rice bowl with pork and mean greens. The pork was tender and moist and also had great flavor. It really filled me up. I can't say I liked one sauce or meat more than the other; they were both excellent.

I've also had the shop burger which has good flavor but the excessive juice/grease makes it sloppy to eat.

The restaurant is small and when I went midweek, it wasn't busy where seating was an issue.  Fun to sit at the bar to watch the action in the kitchen, esp since they've corrected the ventilation problem they had when they opened.

The staff/owners were nice. I wish them success! I'll be a regular.",8,A,Chop Chop Shop,Chop Chop Shop,Chop Chop Shop,5.0

There are no shortages when it comes to pizzerias in Carrollwood. Most of them fit into the same category, in my opinion - enjoyable and a better option than the big chains. Pitza Pizza matches that description.

We ordered a large supreme and pizza rolls. I thought the pizza rolls were fairly unique - they were like a crescent roll with pizza dough and pizza stuffing. The pizza itself was enjoyable, but I came away thinking the pizza rolls were the better part of the meal. My wife felt the exact opposite, but both of us were satisfied.

The sandwich was a little dry for chicken salad. The shredded lettuce looked like it wasn't the green it was when the bag was first opened. The chips they used (Herr's brand) were meh.

The reason I am writing this review is to bring attention to their catering and large take out options.  I came in to order food for family after a funeral.  I was taking food for 10 to eat and I wanted plenty left over for next day meals and snacks so I was in that in-between area between full catering and regular take out.  They were so helpful in guiding me to options that would provide variety and be plentiful.  Really, really helpful - Even advising me on which items would provide more food quantity for the money.  When I arrived to pick up the food later in the day, they had really gone the extra mile packing it so it was easy for me to deliver and still presented very nicely. They even had a nice gentleman help me carry the food to the car!   I will remember them as a go to affordable place for this type of special case or in between catering - I mean really, I don't host a ton of 50+ events, but I take a lot of food to people in the 10-20 meal range - what a find!!!

The cuban here is traditional and the pork is what did it for me. They press it on there flat top grill to seal in the flavor. I also got one of there home made stuffed potatoes and it is by far one of the best i have found around Tampa.

The chicken parm is over cooked spaghetti with a frozen chicken patty. The shrimp scampi had the smallest shrimp that I have ever seen, the noodles were over cooked and tasted like lemon extract and a dirty oven (similar to the way 7-11 pizza smells and tastes).

A couple of subsequent pizzas last summer were of the same excellent quality & equally delicious. But unfortunately, in November of 2020, their food truck was stolen! Yes, STOLEN! I never heard if the thieves were caught and/or if their food truck was recovered, but Pizzeataly was able to reopen in late January. I was delighted to again be able to enjoy that wood-fired oven-baked pizza in a personal pie size, with my favorite toppings of spinach, chicken and feta & mozzarella cheeses.

"This is probably the best pizza I've had in Tampa. We decided to stop by on a whim after dropping by the mall for a quick return, and I'm SO glad we did.

We had a large pizza with the classic sauce, ricotta, Italian sausage, jalapenos, and onions. We did order bacon as well which was accidentally left off, but the pizza was so loaded with the other toppings it honestly didn't matter. Both our waitress and the manager still stopped by more than once to ask if we needed anything and apologize. It was a stark contrast to the service we got at another restaurant the night before, and it was much appreciated.

What can I say about the pizza that hasn't been said? The crust is the perfect balance or crispy and light, with a slightly sweet flavor. They go light on the sauce which I love, and they are extremely generous with the toppings. I mean, our pizza was just completely covered in toppings. I was barely able to take on two slices. Our waitress Mitzi was super nice and attentive. 

So, why four stars instead of five? It's really more of a 4.5. Mostly, I just wish they had more specialty options! The menu is a little limited. They had one specialty option(with chicken sausage and broccoli rabe), but I would just love to see what they would produce if they had some options similar to Mellow Mushroom.

"I hesitate to give a single star, as that is too often an overreaction to a relatively inconsequential issue.  However, based on food quality, service, and cost, this is warranted.  

Contrary to comments from others (including friends), this establishment has low end food with less than stellar service for prices that you would see in New York or London.  In reality this place would not last in those highly competitive markets.

The Filet (if there's one cut that they should ""knock out of the park"", it's this, right?) was a small, gray, mostly tasteless slab.  No seasoning, no crust/char.  Cost? $50.00!  On the plus side, the internal temp was correct.

The sea bass actually smelled like rotten fish when placed on the table.  It was overdone, and smothered in a very strange Asian sauce (from a bottle?).  Perhaps, the kitchen's punishment for not ordering beef.  Cost? $50.00

I liked the Brussel sprouts.  Charred, with bacon and a nice hit of acid in the sauce.

The wine took a long time to come.  And, it took too long to get a 2nd glass, as well.  

Additionally, we were sat by the kitchen/server runway, which is not that pleasant.

Overall, I can only assume people are taken in by the clubby decor and think the food is high quality because it's very expensive.  I believe Charlie's and Berns has good, but not great food.

The 2 women at the table next to me got their drinks, bread, and entrees before my waitress ever came over to acknowledge me.  I finally had to walk up to the bartender to order my drink.  Then the waitress came by about a minute later, and I told her I just put in my drink order.  She apologized & said she'd check on what was going on.  About 10 minutes later she appeared with my drink & a glass if water.  She didn't leave me with a straw to drink my beverage with or even offer one, so I had to walk up to the bar yet once again to retrieve my own straw.  Finally my bread arrived.  By the time the waitress came back over to check on me, about 15 minutes later, I decided that I did not even want to try to order food at this place, so I got my check (which was way overpriced for the beverage I received) and left.  I will never again waste my time at this establishment.

"Stopped in for our own little Easter brunch complete with a creative loafing deal that gave us $15 worth of stuff for $2.50.  We were already off to a good start.  The pastry case looked amazing and we settled on splitting a vanilla cupcake with nutella frosting.  Yes we decided on dessert first....don't you?  My husband had a croissant sandwich with egg and cheddar that came with an orange slice.  He loved it.  Fluffy egg, freshly baked croissant and thick melted cheese.  I had scrambled eggs that came with three slices of toast and an orange slice.  I also got the side of fruit which was a rather large bowl of strawberries, blueberry, kiwi and green apple.  I could tell it was fresh from that morning as the apple was still true to its color.  The scrambled eggs were just ok.  I got a lot of them, but they were a little dry which was a perfect match for my dry toast.  I guess you have to ask for butter or jam.  We also had a hazelnut latte that was delicious and enormous.  It stayed piping hot through our meal and was so big that we got a to go cup.  My husband said it was the best latte he's had in town.  Oh, did I mention that had chocolate samples?  We tried all three, white, milk and dark chocolate.  They were delicious but when we asked how we could buy some they didn't know.  They didn't think they were selling it which we thought was odd.  Onto the cupcake.  It was a mini version which is good considering we ate all the above.  The cupcake was moist and the frosting was chilled, thick and creamy.  We couldn't detect the nutella, rather it tasted almost like a frosty in frosting form.  It was good, but not great.  We were hoping to get some brioche, but showing up at noon on Easter Sunday is probably the reason we didn't get any.  Oh, and if you're wondering we got all the above for $5.50 thanks to our great deal. I will be back to try lunch someday and to sample more of their baked goods.  

Just a few tips---parking is in the Ventana garage immediately on the right when you enter the parking lot.  There are about 5 reserved spaces for the restaurant and we were able to pull right in.  It's sort of self-service...you place your order at the counter, get your own water, come back to get your food, and put your plates up in the bins on your way out.",30,C,Le Mouton Noir Bakehouse,Le Mouton Noir Bakehouse,L3 Mouton Noir Bak3hous3,3.0

"It was my first time at Ocean Prime and I must say I was impressed. We are in town for the weekend and wanted to enjoy a nice dinner. My mom also has a friend who lives in Tampa so he suggested to come here. We made reservations by calling ahead an hour before we wanted to come and we were booked. Easy pease to set reservations. The staff was very nice and we enjoyed our dinner. Our waiter was Danny and he was super cool as well. 

We all started with drinks. My mom and I had Moscato, my husband had Pinot Noir and my mom's friend had an Old Fashioned. The drinks were good!  No complaints.  They also brought bread to the table. Their bread was very good! I also really appreciated that the bread was served warmed. I love when the butter just melts on the bread. The bread basket came with two types of breads. It came with rolls and pretzel bread. My fav were the rolls.My husband and I also shared the Prime Roll Sushi. It was delicious and packed with flavor. 

After bread and drinks, some of us started with salads. My mom and I shared the Wedge Salad and my mom's friend had the Caesar. I really loved how this wedge salad's dressing was like a bleu cheese dressing vinaigrette. It was perfect. I normally don't like wedge salads as the dressing can be too much. This salad it was perfect. A good salad! 

Apparently, they are known for their steaks. While my husband and I wanted to try other items, we couldn't come without trying a steak. My mom had steak and lobster, her friend got steak with bleu cheese crust and my husband and I split steak and lobster with black truffle butter. We also shared sides like creamed spinach and mashed potatoes. I also got a baked potato. All of their food was perfect and cooked to the perfect temperature. They cooked the steaks perfectly! So tender and juicy. I also liked that they served warm butter with the lobster. I will say while the creamed spinach was good it was rich. 

Now it's time for dessert! We saw from Yelp and heard that the top two desserts are their 10 Layer Carrot Cake and their Warm Butter Cake, so we ordered both! Both were good but my favorite was the Carrot Cake. It was moist and layered with deliciousness. 

Overall, Ocean Prime offers some pretty good food! We left full and happy!",32,C,Ocean Prime,Ocean Prime,Ocean Prime,5.0

I felt so much healthy with the options here. My bowl was so good. Bbq chicken and tofu, sweet potato noodles and cauli mash, mushrooms and broccoli, guacamole and creamy ginger sauce. So so good.

The one thing that is a bit hard is hearing the people working. It's super echoey, music is loud, the screens, and masks. I'd simply suggest lowering the music on the ordering side.

But I love this spot and it's outside space is nice and there is so much attention to detail. It's inside space is not too big. They have four full booths and half booths against the wall.

"The good:

Stellar service, great chips. Authentic Mexican cantina vibe. Good prices! 

The not so good:

Beans should've been more caliente , less limón in the guacamole, and the delish house salsa is 1000% too liquidy - like it's made w tomato Juice. The fajita ensalada was skimpy - please make a nice plate with shredded cabbage, tomato and onion, limon, crema and guac as is the custom . Juke Box was muy ruido. Turn it down please for nice background música. Use nice, nice thick napkins, not the tissue- thin kind. And please clean the glass front doors, add some plants and freshen up the mood! 

And pleeeeaaaassseee add chile rellenos, more grilled veggies for vegetarian fajitas (cauliflower, broccoli, hongos, eggplant), free sour cream, and a Baja fish taco (crispy) plato!

The Gyros were pretty good could be on par with Acropolis. The Opa fries were very different from Acropolis (out of a red Ore-Ida bag and heavily seasoned; no feta), still okay though. The sides that came with the Gyro were pretty good. Very light and the plate didn't seem too loaded with food like Acropolis tends to do. 

Service was pretty slow, the place just opened when we came. Watched about half of ""My Baby's Daddy"" before any food came out. Overall, on taste, isn't bad, but nothing to rave about.

"Boyfriend and I just moved to the area from out of state. We both worked in the service industry and maybe our expectations are higher than most. So needless to say, we say no thank you. 
We weren't told of any specials going on, Thursday night. Guess it's ladies night?! Didn't know. 
No way of knowing what's on draft unless your at the bar itself. 
Wings took 30+ mins to get as an appetizer. (Have had better, nothing special!) very bummed about the ""homemade"" sauces. Not very exciting. Tried both Hot Garlic and Sweet Chili. 
Blue cheese seems very generic or non homemade. 
Classic burger was overpowered with garlic seasoning. A good burger just needs salt and pepper if it's good beef, as they claim to have. 
Their new Cuban sandwich, which I knew wasn't the best choice bc were at a bar but still gave it a try. They claim to use Boars Head meat so how can that sandwich be bad? Well it was. Grossly dry. 
Now time to cash out. The server tells you they need a cc to hold a tab open. I totally understand and have no problem with that. She assures us that the card won't be swiped. So when we say we're ready to cash out she brings the black book and says I'll be back with a pen. ??? Look in the book and the cc was ran for the whole tab. Well wouldn't you ask prior if we'd like to pay cash or run our card? 
Assuming is the one thing you don't do in the service industry.

"I have never been so disappointed visiting a tea room. I used to be a frequent of this tea room before I had my daughter (almost two years ago), and the service was always supurb until today. I was really looking forward to having my daughter experience this tea room that I have loved and raved about so much! I have also reffered a lot of people there over the years as well!!! When my party walked in the door we received NO greeting. After we walked around a bit we were approached by our party's name which was kind of odd (without a greeting).  No ""hello""or welcome whatsoever. It was just awkward. It wasn't busy at the time we walked in either. Just one couple there (that were rude as well....different story for a different day). The whole beginning to middle of our visit, we were just treated very poorly....even asking questions we just were not given a friendly response. I was on the verge of tears at one point because I have been wanting to take my daughter here since it was one of my most favorite tea rooms ever. I have visited tea rooms all around the country and have had wonderful services at each one:)  I guess somewhere along the  duration of our visit the two owners felt bad because they had become a bit more appeasing towards us, which I do give them credit for. *Considering how much they charge for their service, it should have been superior service from the beginning. Being in a similar business myself, I understand the importance of treating your guests with the utmost care possible....NO MATTER what the situation may be. I will never be going back to this tea room again.  Just makes myself take a step back and make sure I NEVER treat my guests as rudely as I was treated today.

"I have been going to New World Brewery since they opened over 15 years ago. This is not a typical ybor spot. This is a comfortable laid back bar with an interesting group of patrons and staff who support local live music. There is not always a live band playing but the bands that play here are not cover bands - instead, they are bands usually signed to an independent label that are on a first national tour or a local band developing a unique sound and working to prepare for a national tour. When there is a cover, you are in for a talented treat. NWB does not brew their own beer and hasn't for a long time. Instead, they focus on excellent craft beers from all around the country with only a few overtly mainstream beers (e.g. sweet water) but a large collection of national and international brews on draught and in bottle. There is a great outdoor patio with a fountain, a covered patio with the stage area and an indoor area with large open doors that flows seamlessly to the outside patio. There is heat during winter inside and portable heaters outside as well as AC in summer - even with the doors open, the space is always comfortable. The food is not to be overlooked either. There is BBQ on Wednesdays and sometimes on the weekend that is cooked in a large smoker outside. The pizza is my favorite menu item and is surprisingly some of the best pizza in Tampa (thin crust). Obviously, this is one of my favorite places in the world - consistently excellent for a large chunk of my life. There is free wifi and, during the day, this is a quiet nice place to relax and get work done (although there is no coffee - just soda and beer).

"Two years since my initial review of this PDQ and today offered a fantastic customer service experience.

Sliding in here well after the lunch rush, I was intrigued by the new Buffy Bleu chicken sandwich.

A manager stepped right up to the counter to take my order and we discussed the details of this new sandwich. 

Remember, you always know who the manager at PDQ is because they always wear the white coat. Kind of like the one Kramer wore in Seinfeld when he gave George's boss a skin cancer screening after Jerry ran off the actual Doctor by calling her ""Pimple Popper, MD.""

I was concerned the sandwich had actual blue cheese dressing on it and the manager told me that it was not a blue cheese dressing, but rather an ingredient of the overall sauce used on the chicken itself.

He convinced me to give it a try by telling me he also was not a fan of actual blue cheese dressing and then he told me on multiple occasions that if I did not like it, I could bring it back up to him at the counter and he'd make me any other sandwich on the menu.

I'm trying to remember the last time any fast food restaurant openly and unsolicited offered me this kind of option. Nope...I'm coming up with nothing.

The sandwich was perfectly prepared and the first bite had a lot of heat in it. Not the temperature of the chicken, but the spicy nature of the sauce we discussed. 

However, the more I enjoyed the sandwich, the more accustomed to the heat I became and I  never so much as tasted any hint of blue cheese that would have turned me off.

Before leaving, I thanked the manager for his ""like it or exchange it"" offer and told him it was not necessary. Also said I would definitely order this new item again and that PDQ might actually be better off not describing blue cheese at all in the description.

If you like saucy, hot wings and can handle the spices, this is a sandwich for you.

The staff was extremely nice and accommodating. We ordered a Caesar Salad which is large enough to feed 4. The croutons were nice and peppery and the Caesar dressing had the perfect amount of tang.

We ordered a pizza - half cheese and half with mushrooms. It had just the right amount of cheese and wasn't greasy at all. The topping off mushrooms was just the right amount. The crust was perfectly thin. It is extremely large - 24 inches- but it tastes just as good the next day.",36,C,Paci's Pizza,Paci's Pizza,Paci's Pizza,5.0

What I really liked about the soup is that salt was on point! Not too much and it didn't need any more than what it had. Also, the large portion is more than enough for one person. It comes with rice, plantains and salad so it's plenty of food. I even have some leftovers for later.

Every time I go there it is clean and organized. The owner is such a sweetheart. They also have a to go menu and they even offered me a call ahead to have it ready since they know I am always in a rush during the week.

"Why 4 stars? Because I enjoyed my birria tacos but they were a bit bland.

Because I'm such a trendy fella, I have been trying lots of birria tacos lately and I have to say that I find the range to be quite vast. The first time I tried them, I didn't like them at all. The second time, they were amazing. The third time, they were just okay. 

Time #4 came from Mangonadas. I found them to be enjoyable overall, but also lacking a ton of flavor. I added in the veggies and sauce, which helped, but was still left feeling a void of much zest. My wife ordered a quesadilla, however, and I thought that was great.

I didn't pay very close attention to the reviews before I visited, so I was surprised to see this in a gas station parking lot. When I say surprised, I mean that in a good way. Everyone knows some of the best food comes from places like this. I'd happily return to check out the rest of their menu.

"We were in town for business and read the reviews on Yelp. We decided to give it a try. I spent $60 for 2 and was not full which unfortunately is the downfall of eating seafood. 

The restaurant is in strip mall facing the street but the sign is hard to see unless you were looking out the window at the right time. Definitely nothing fancy just a wholesome mom and pop seafood take out/eat in restaurant. 

The owner was friendly and greeted us quickly. It's a very laid back, easy going place. We asked for recommendations and lobster chowder & steam lobster came to thier mind. The lobster chowder came in a to go styrofoam bowl that was heated in the microwave. It was more like soup than chowder, had chunks of potatoes & lobster. They weren't cheap on the lobster which was great however, I wished it was heated up warmer. The soup was heated in the microwave which was disappointing. 

We also ordered fried scallops which was very good when it was hot. Then our 2.5 lb lobster came. The lobster was great but very messy to eat. Even though the owner cracked the claw and split the lobster in half, all the meat was still not enough to satisfy our craving. I would come back to this place and try thier U Conn roll.

"Noble Rice was a fun and delicious option for a double date. The decor is great and the restaurant is a nice size and well laid out. We enjoyed a variety of different items - fried chicken steam buns, chicken heart and avocado yakitori, salmon carpaccio, and habanero bbq ribs. Our friends got other items and I had the opportunity to try one of their sushi rolls (spicy tuna, avocado, and other fish) as well as the chicken thigh yakitori and both of their dishes were delicious. We liked every dish but I'd probably pass on the salmon carpaccio and avocado because they were nothing special, in my opinion. The service plate (complimentary taste) of the night was an octopus ceviche...It was quite yummy! I wish they had given us 1 portion for each couple instead of 1 for the table, but that's okay. We also tried the sweet potato shochyu, which was accurately described as a vodka-like alcohol with no bite. I wish they used that for some unique cocktails - it was super tasty, but I'm not one to typically sip straight liquor...it'd be amazing in a cocktail!

We couldn't find the place at first because there are no signs and the only way to find it was by the Valet Parking sign.  We were then directed to walk down a path, knock on the door and give the code word provided by the valet.  We did so and were allowed entry into a Speakeasy with live jazz.  The drinks were amazing; although I hate liquorish, I had to try Absinthe for the presentation alone which involved burning the sugar cube at our table and then adding the cold water.  My wife ended up with a Gin Fizz the first round and a ""Sloe and Loe"" the second round as I switched to a Moscow Mule.  Dinner was fondue, crabcakes and Chicken & Waffles, tapas style.

"On occasion, really good food get dished out of dumpy, hole-in-the-wall restaurants.  This is not one of those occasions.  This review is based on food, service, cleanliness, atmosphere, and value. 

They open at 11:00, and by that, I mean the owner(?) strolls in at 11:05 and starts getting ready for customers.  She didn't seem to be happy about having customers.  She was impatient, and rude.  Maybe that's why we were the only ones there for that 30 minute period while we waited. 

The place is not big enough to accommodate dine in, so it's take out only.  That's probably a good thing, because the little 4' by 8' area I did step foot in was filthy.  I would have walked out, but I had already bought a Groupon offer.  Dam you Groupon!!!

The food was expensive for the portion and quality.  I ordered the stir fry shrimp.  It only came with 6 tiny shrimp, which was a disappointment, but the kicker was I didn't enjoy anything about the dish.  It was overly salty (and I love salt), and the veggies were mush.  90% of the dish was rice.

Even with the Groupon, I would say the value is bad.  The food isn't good, the menu is limited, and the service stinks.  Can't say I'll return.",33,C,813 Salad And Seafood,813 Salad And Seafood,813 Salad And Seaf00d,2.0

"The Basics: Vallarta's is a Mexican restaurant located in Carrollwood on Dale Mabry. It is a very straight forward, casual Tex-Mex spot. 

Things I like: The food here is pretty average. My boyfriend did enjoy the chicken and beef nachos quite a bit. We were able to sit right away at around 6:30pm on a Friday night, which was good.

Things I didn't like: I wasn't very impressed by the food or the atmosphere. The queso was very thin and had very little flavor to it-- honestly it was some of the worst queso I have had at a Mexican restaurant. The chicken fajitas also had barely any peppers and onions mixed into it. 

Also, this restaurant is a bit run down and doesn't look the nicest inside. It is also extremely cramped. Tables are right on top of each other which doesn't make for the most comfortable dining experience.

"Basically I hated this place.
Honestly I can say I didn't go to MacDintons with the best attitude; I had a preconceived notion and well...it completely lived up to it. The only reason I went was because I was hanging out with old girlfriends from high school that I hadn't seen in a couple of years and these are the type of places they enjoy. Every person that goes to these kinds of bars isn't a douchebag (my friends aren't), but the ones that are are so boisterous that it's easy to lump everyone together.

First off, it took the bouncer like 5 minutes of back and fourth before he let me in. Then, I immediately got bumped into by a girl that proceed to murmur something like ""does she not know who I am?"" No girl, sorry I don't. My drink was way more soda than vodka and cost me like $5 for a single size...dumb!

A handful of guys tried to play the ""what race are you?"" game with me - my favorite! I argued with a couple of them for almost 10 minutes about the fact that I am NOT Middle Eastern or Indian.

"Both the food and service left something to be desired.

The good - nothing really stood out.

The so-so - I guess the food was ok... It just wasn't what we ordered.  We ordered a fried chicken dinner and jerk wings.  We received jerk chicken and fried wings.  No big deal if the waitress would have just admitted the mistake and did not try to convince us that the jerk chicken was fried chicken.  ""That's how our fried chicken comes out"" she insisted. Meanwhile the ""jerk wings"" were obviously deep fried and lacking any kind of jerk seasoning.  No biggie, we just switched plates.  In the end, the food wasn't too bad.  Not great, just not bad either.

The bad - the service.  First we were told some items were unavailable for a special.  A couple that came in shortly after we were seated we told by a different waitress that those items are available for the special.

"My latest experience was hit and miss. I have been to Gallito twice now. Tonight I went before on a Thursday before a Bolts game and it was surprisingly not very  busy. I ordered 6 tacos and a sangria to shared with some friends. The pork belly tacos were delicious. They were fatty and had some sweetness with pineapple on top. ""What the Duck?"" is all I have to say about the duck tacos. They were cold and tasted gamey. My friend couldn't even finish hers. The chicken tacos were pretty good and were something I would order again. If I had known how small the sangria was I would not have paid $8 for a small glass. It tasted like just red wine with diced apples and wasn't very special. There are way better  drink options in Sparkman Wharf than this. My second time here was far more disappointing than my first.

The banana nut carmel waffle had so much nuts in it and was really hard to taste the waffle. I think someone accidentaly poured to much nuts. However, The stuffed raspberry french toast with cream cheese was sooo delicious! I would definitely come back for that alone. The pancake, waffle, french toast doesn't come with sides.

My wife and I tried an app, entre and drinks. 
The environment and ambiance was cool. It was not very crowded. They have Bocci ball and other games set up outside. Valet parking available. I'm not sure if self parking is an option unless you park on the street like on Fremont Ave. 

Our meal:
Appetizer:  Crispy Arancini = tasty  
Dinner: 
BLT-ish with fries: very good. Bacon seemed a little well done. Not my personal preference, but I know there's nothing wrong with crispy bacon and some people love it. Fries were fresh and hearty. Big fan!

The Fremont: this was the secret blend burger with blue cheese. I usually love blue cheese burgers. I did not enjoy his at all. Same for my dinner date. It tasted off. Hard to say why. It just wasn't a pleasant experience. I chose the salad as the side. This was. It an extra charge which was nice. However, it was a very wimpy salad. Not much to it at all. 

The drinks: I got a Rough Rider. In short, it was too small, too watered down. I feel like if a restaurant is only going to have 10 cocktails on a menu, only one with Scotch, you better make them damn good. PSB did not here. We stuck with wine and beer after that. But they didn't even fill my draft beer to the top. 

The service: waitress was very nice. She was very soft spoken, so I could barely hear her. She also forgot what I ordered for drinks 2 times, so had to come back to me and have me point out what I ordered on the menu. And this didn't happen on 4/20 either.

"I really hate doing negative reviews. We were begged to give this place a second try. The first time we tried the crab cakes and stuffed mushrooms. Everything was so salty I couldn't eat much. So we were told maybe it was extra salty that day. OK I'm always up to give a business a second chance. 

We went to try again and ordered the fried mushrooms and grouper dinner. We did ask and the grouper was frozen, however I believe there is still a ban from fishing grouper, although I'd prefer fresh....Understandable! But, here we go again with the heavy heavy salty batter. It irritated my stomach so horribly. The rice was inedible to the point where it was completely hard and not cooked at all. The beans tasted as if they'd sat in a hot crock pot for 3 days. The oil tasted old with a burnt flavor. 

I'm not so sure I'm understanding why people speak so highly of this place. We sat in the bar and had phenomenal service! We didn't complain because we were so hungry and just wanted to eat!

If your not a sandwich person it's okay they have other things on the menu such as salads,crab cakes,wraps etc.. You can also get out the door without going broke witch is a plus. 

Most of the time and for sure on the weekends you may have to wait a bit. These guys do get really busy and it's not the biggest store but I promise you it's worth the wait. They do take call in orders so if your getting more then a couple things I'd suggest calling ahead to miss long lines. 

With all that being said you'd think they earned a five start but no there is a few small problems.

My special lady friend and I have been twice, and each time, we wholeheartedly vow to return.

"The sono Cafe is located behind the Tampa Museuem of art museums by Curtis Hixon park. It is right on the river which makes for beautiful views of the best of Tampa Bay.

We went there for brunch and were quite pleased with the service and the staff that we interacted with. The cafe is ceiling to floor windows completely an open field of silver and glass. It gives you an overall eclectic and restful feeling. Of course my favorite views are always of the water.

We played around with some of the different choices of food so we could have several samplings of different things. An omelette was very tasty and head cheese and fresh vegetables contained in it. The blueberry muffins very tasty, well cooked and not overly sweet. The mixed fruit was a nice portion of various melons and berries, which were seasonal and the smoked salmon was fairly good but a little dry.

I didn't particularly like the coffee but maybe it was old or it wasn't a very good batch.

I learned during our visit that the establishment was owned by our own famous Mise en Place . There's also a little shop inside that's quite unique in is fun too wander around and see what delights you might discover.

Overall it didn't feel like an independent restaurant. The menu was representative of a lot of things that were healthy yet they had variety. I can't say I loved all of the food, but overall the food was good.

I really like to come back later in the day and try this establishment for happy hour and some appetizers. It says its open on Friday nights for dinner and maybe that would be a good time to try it out the next time. Either way I think it deserves a second try before I can adequately rated. I don't know maybe it's just me I want to believe that they can do better with their service times and quality of service as well as or unique dishes that are more remarkable.

"Pedro And Cary. Not to be confused with that evil corporation (Enron And Cary), the place that sells replacement arm joints (Elbow And Cary), or a cheap motel just outside town (Bedbug And Cary).

I'm going to Cary on with my reviews by voting for Pedro. One of these guys may be as short as Napoleon but their products are Dynamite.

Just don't try and bring a pool stick in here, because they have a Cue Ban in effect.

My notes said: Wonderful cafe with good Flan, but the star was the piping hot perfect Guava pastry that rocked my world, and very delicious scalding coffee too. Good prices, great service.

To elaborate: I absolutely love this little unassuming, undiscovered, unexplored place... in fact I love it little bit too much. The people serving are absolutely wonderful, and were super happy to have me here, and super friendly. Of every Cuban place I've ever been to they might be the friendliest, and definitely top 5 along with the Cuban burger place in Miami for example. They're definitely right up there.

Not to be confused with my out of town letter-writing friend (Penpal And Cary), my email that won't send (Pending And Cary), my libido (Lead In My Pencil And Cary), and Barbie's fave pampering activity (Pedicure And Cary).

I'll definitely be back here absolutely every time I'm in town, and all the products they serve are top-notch and amazing. I would give them five stars for any one of them and all of them combined should get more like 15 stars really. Extra credit to them for being genius enough to sell me on the guava pastry, which I wasn't really looking at, but once they gave me the heads up that they were fresh and hot, I tried one and fell madly in love with it, to the extent that I just bought a ring and I'm going to propose.

So now let's propose a toast. I mean propose to our toast. I mean, if we're proposing to guava pastries, we may as well propose to toast as well, right? 

Seriously. Make sure you come here when you're in town - amazing stuff and it's dirt cheap as well. Plus it was one of the best Cuban coffees I had in my whole time in Florida.

Now that you've enjoyed my flow, it's time for me to rida off into the sunset with my coffee and my pastry de Guayaba. Aba nice day, and if you're single, take a chance on me.

He even tightened a screw in the oven with a knife and then set it down to be used to cut the sandwich. I told the manager I couldn't believe he was throwing food around and I do not want the sandwiches. ""He told me to get out and never come back"". I said something back to him that I will not repeat.

We were seated and our server came by to introduce himself, he was really nice and informed us he would give us a minute to look over the menu and bring us some waters. When he came back we were ready. Honey got the Omelette and added some tomato slices on the side (this is his thing). I got a platter that included eggs, bacon and pancakes. We both really wanted pancakes and didn't want to have a whole meal centered on pancakes so I opted for this platter so that he could have a pancake and I could have a few bites and get my fix. The food was good, pretty standard. I do have to say the pancakes were amazing. They were perfectly fluffy, we really enjoyed them and even commented on how yummy it was. It was a pretty uneventful visit. Our server checked on us a few times, and finally got our check and we left feeling full and satisfied.

My friend didn't like the chicken Shawarma dinner either, except he loved the rice.

"If I'm being completely honest - I feel like Sparkman Wharf is a big disappointment. Channelside before when it was in its prime was popping with plenty of restaurants, live music, a movie theater, and more. 

The replacement feels like some PODS that local restaurants have been squeezed into. Parking is definitely a joke and needs lots of improvement. Either way this place is slammed so be prepared to wait, wait, and wait some more both to order and get your food just like when Hall on Franklin and Armature Works opened their doors. 

It is nice to have something waterfront though and I feel Sparkman Wharf does do a better job than its predecessor at achieving that focus, but still it isn't something I would want to drive across town, search for parking, and then navigate afterwards...which is a shame because I like most people was expecting maybe too much from this.

"My coworker and I HAD to meet our boss here.  He visited us once a month on the road.  My dread turned into one of the best dinners I've ever had.  Landry's staff and atmosphere turned my intimidating boss into a regular person at least for an evening. (with a little help from white zinfandel)

We dined outdoors even though it was in the fifties.  The heat lamps helped a little. My partner and I were enjoying a local brew that I wish I could remember the name of while my boss was waving w zins left and right.  Hmm.  

We sucked down a dozen oysters and tried the seafood poppers.  Not bad.  I had the filet with lobster tail.  The filet could be cut with a butter knife.  And the tail?  Perfect.  My friends had the seafood platter.  Fried perfectly.

His truck is located on Flora Street, right off Sheldon Road. He shares the lot with a produce stand named Hercules Fresh Market (also great!) and he's there Wed-Sun. I got his rib sandwich for lunch, and was blown away! The ribs were tender, succulent, and fell right off the bone. Mike's sauces were great as well; they're tomato-based, so a bit different than mustard or vinegar-based ones. He was also nice enough to give me samples of all of his sides, and sent me home with a brownie! I loved his collard greens, cole slaw, and potato salad. He was out of his legendary mac-and-cheese by the time I stopped by, but I will for sure be back to try it!

"3.5 I was debating between a 3 and a 4 rating.

 It deserves a 4 because (i) it has a great location in the heart of Ybor for excellent people watching and (ii) it was a large and revolving wine selection and (iii) a fairly knowledgeable staff. 

The reason I want to give it 3 stars is because we tried this place for the first time after buying a living social deal and the wines we were served were mostly horrible. I am a big wine drinker and I can peruse Total Wine for hours like a kid at Disney World and even with my very little knowledge of wine, I have never selected anything as awful tastings as the wines we were served. I don't expect them to serve us glasses from $90 bottles but dang it tasted like some $4 hooker pressed some rotten grapes between her toes and it was bottled up.

I will come back because of location, the large wine menu but I will be choosing my own wine. And if those end up being horrible then I will update my review because then there's an issue with the menu itself.",15,B,Ybor City Wine Bar,Ybor City Wine Bar,Ybor City Wine B@r,4.0

"If you're going to offer a healthy alternative, that's great. But it should at least taste close to the original, and this place fails on that end.

The food is expensive, but they do offer a lot of coupons in papers and around the area. Your burger simply doesn't taste like a burger. It's like a healthy meat smudge that's freeze dried like astronaut ice cream. If you compared it even to a double cheeseburger from McDonald's, you would say that Mickey D's had more flavor. Granted it's much healthier and better for you, but the taste just isn't there.

I haven't had the wraps, but I've heard they're pretty good. I'm not sure how much healthier one wrap can be over another. The air fries are good, and show you can make a good french fry without oil. But they're not good enough to justify missing a much better meal overall somewhere else.

"I am sad to say that I think this location is going down hill. This used to be our go-to place for a nice dinner. It isn't cheap but you could consistently expect the food to be high quality and well executed. Not this time. First of all, they remodeled the place and the waiter wanted to tell us all about that. Maybe they are more focused on decor now than the food. I thought it looked fine before and I don't go to restaurants strictly for how they look inside. We always get the bang bang shrimp so we ordered that. I bit into a nice crunchy chunk of shell which has never happened before. Also, you could see some of the shrimp were little bits of shrimp instead of full pieces. Your server used to bring your drinks, now they have separated that out to other staff. It took forever for us to get our draft beer orders each time even though we were 2 feet from the bar. My mom ordered the seared tune steak. It was an oddly shaped piece of tuna (looked like some scrap piece) and to top it off it was not seared (rare in the middle) but completely cooked all the way though, not a trace of red or even pink.

It's just really good pizza that happens to be new york style pizza, not just in name but also in characteristics and flavor.  The pizza has the right balance of sauce and cheese and the crust is crispy but is soft enough to fold.

I sat for 15 minutes before I flagged a waitress and asked who the waiter or waitress was that would be taking care of my table.

"I think it is great they opened a stand alone location and the area they opened up it in great. Parking for anyone that is coming by is probably and issue, but if you are in the area because you're going out or work near by, stop in. They are nice and the food is really good. Know if you're eating there, though, it is not a healthy meal. Everything on the menu is intense and the only thing I would suggest to them is give a couple healthier options.

This place is located in the corner of the Bay Plaza. I came by on a Saturday afternoon. This is as authentic as you can get for a Colombian bakery! Everything is fresh and made in house! The  meat Empanadas are delicious; they are served with a side of their homemade spicy sauce. The torta de maize with cheese was excellent; this is a deep fried corncake with cheese. The Pan de Bono was perfect as well; this is like a cheese bread which has a soft cheesey inside. They have other items on their menu which I will definitely be back to check out!

"I basically have two rules whenever I'm travelling - No chains, and no hotel restaurants. ""Well, it's more of a guideline than a rule"". After I finished work I decided I wanted to treat myself to seafood (good seafood). The hotel really drummed up The Oyster Catcher, their seafood restaurant. I've always found that restaurant quality is inversely proportional to the amount that they feel the need to hype the place. But laziness won out, and I decided to check the place out.

I'm so very glad I did.

I sat at the bar ([voice style=""Eddie Izzard""] like I do [/voice]) and started off with my standard very dry Maker's Manhattan up. (If you've ordered anything at Starbucks that takes more than 4 words to specify I don't want to hear any static for being specific.) It was made to perfection.

I ordered the salad and then froze when it came to make a decision on food. The bartender suggested the yellowfin tuna blackened. I decided to trust him and was not disappointed - it was just amazing. Great sear on it, very rare on the inside, and just all-in-all a great piece of fish. He also paired it with a pinot noir, which I never would have put with a fish. Excellent match.

I don't normally do dessert, but they had a goat cheese cheesecake. Anyone who knows me knows my love for goat cheese and cheesecake, so the two together sounded like one of the greatest things ever created. And it was. Once again I relied on the bartender for a drink pairing, and he brought out a cappuccino with some Gran Marnier. It worked perfectly with the sweet/savory flavor from the cheesecake.

To top it all off, the restaurant is right on the bay, which offers a fantastic sunset if you get there at the right time. I will definitely be back!",8,A,Oystercatchers,Oystercatchers,Oystercatchers,5.0

"The ""yelp special"" is taking the slab from 25 bucks to 20 bucks. I got the chicken combo. You can either get dark meat or white meat. I prefer dark meat so that's what I ordered. Unfortunately the he next batch wasn't finished. That's my fault for showing up late on a Saturday! Wanted to try the sauce on the side so I could try to provide y'all with the most accurate description of flavor with no add-ons, unfortunately pops in the back forgot and put it all over. Now when I checked the prices I was thinking ""dangggg kinda steep compared to a lot of others"". That was until I opened that styrofoam box! Most places put your whole meal in that box....naw this guy said I want all the smoke and the whole box was nothing but meat lol. The sides where in seperate containers! I'll leave pics below. Now I'm torn between a four star and a five star ONLY Bc I really wanted sauce on the side and wanted all dark meat. But shytttt once I tasted the food I knew my verdict! Mac n cheese is pretty damn good and collards finally don't taste store bought. But that chicken mannnnnnnnn moist and delicious and not too overly smoked!

"It pains me to write a bad review about a business I know good people run, but I have to be honest. The problem here is the donuts. Just like Mini Donut Factory, I don't like these little donuts. Some people are in love with them  based on other reviews I've read . I think the appeal is you can eat more and try different flavors without feeling as bad about yourself because they're small. But they taste stale and dry to me which is weird because I know they're made fresh-on-the -spot. I think it's the mere fact that when you miniaturize something it's less moist. Also the toppings were extremely stale.

 I ordered a chocolate pretzel donut, a rice crispy donut, and a maple bacon donut. The Rice Krispies and the pretzels were extremely stale. The maple bacon didn't have very good flavor. The bacon was so overdone it hurt my teeth. I went on National Donut Day and the place was busy naturally, but the process is a slow process, regardless of the crowd. 

I don't understand the need to make them the moment after they're ordered. Who wants to sit around and wait for someone to hand-make 12 little tiny donuts? Why can't they just make them ahead of time? As I mentioned before it didn't make them taste any fresher... 

The building itself is very cute, modern, and clean. The service was excellent. One of the owners, a young man, stopped what he was doing to thank everyone for coming. He seemed like a hard-worker and a nice person but I think one thing they could improve is the system. Just add a table or case with your most popular or less intricate pre-made donuts so people can come in and go quickly.  If they want something special or if you run out of a flavor, they can wait then. 
I would also ditch the idea of putting crunchy toppings on the donuts like pretzels because they do go stale unless you can find a better way to keep them fresh.",12,A,Take Three Cafe,Take Three Cafe,Take Three Cafe,2.0

"Taqueria Monterrey is the little sister of El Taconazo (The Taco Bus). They have the same great sweet tea as Taco Bus, but the menu and atmosphere are different. Taqueria Monterrey has a small menu, but is big on flavor. 

Much like the Bus, they have a variety of meat and non-meat options including a new option they call ""Vegan Chorizo"". The ""Chorizo"" is well-spiced crumbles of soy protein griddled to perfection. Try it in the Gringas, a grilled flour tortilla topped with the ""Chorizo,"" grilled pineapple and slices of avocado. 

They offer burritos, quesadillas, tortas and my favorite, flautas. They have beef, chicken and potato flautas. The potato ones are filled with a cheesy, creamy potato mixture reminiscent of mashed potatoes and are fried crisp. They're topped with shredded lettuce, big slices of tomato and an avocado cream sauce that I really wish they would bottle and sell. 

Additionally, there's a salsa bar that has 10 or so fresh salsas everyday ranging from a cool avocado salsa to a kickin' peanut butter salsa (it sounds weird, but try it!). The bar also has pickled radishes, limes and their house signature salsa, a great blend of roasted peppers, tomatoes and onions. The guacamole may seem pricey, but try it. It's made-to-order hand-smashed avocados mixed with their pico de gallo and is chunky and delicious!

Service can be slow at times, because there's usually only 1 or 2 servers working both to-go and the restaurant. If you're allergic to peanuts, avoid the two orange salsas on the salsa bar; I know at least one of them has peanuts in it!

"It pains me to say this, but their food is fantastic and their Chile Verde is out of this world.  Yes I'm a California mexican food snob, but hey, i grew up eating mexican food and it's nearly impossible to find good mexican in Tampa, let alone Florida.  So 4 stars and I say it pains me to give give them that you ask?  It pains me because the service is soooo bad.  I mean, it's so bad you have to look around for a hidden camera bad.  Every time I go at least one table walks out from just benign neglect from the wait staff. There will be periods for 10-15 minutes where there is literally not an employee to be found. No wait staff. Nobody manning the cashier booth. No greeter.  Just a roomful of patrons looking around at each other like they are in the twilight zone.  But then when your food arrives, you are rewarded with rich flavors and extremely tender pork or beef.  I'd go every week if the service wasn't from the the twilight zone.  Instead, the wife and i are relegated to once a quarter because that's all we can take. So as long as you know going in that the service will be so otherworldy, and assuming you survive that, you're in for a treat with some really outstanding food.

Pro-move ;) and the broccoli cheddar soup. The combo was rich with high quality ingredients and worth the wait! Dipping the pizza in the soup was absolute heaven. Some other highlights from previous visits are the roasted beet salad and the stuff zucchini- yes a pizza place that makes great veggie options!

"It is hard to write this review to be perfectly honest. The other reviews are stunning for Sushi Raw and my husband and I were pretty excited to try the sushi here. The menu is chock full of choices. We tried the Summer of Love roll and the Tokyo roll, in addition to the sushi dinner platter. I actually really enjoyed the Summer of Love roll - it really was innovative and delicious. The rice paper and lettuce add an interesting texture and taste, and it was great. The Tokyo roll was good as well. And so were the sushi platters - excellent variety. 

So why the negative review? We had some of the worst service I have ever encountered during our visit. We arrived and it took us about 5 minutes to decide on the rolls. We got our soup & salad. And waited. And waited. And waited. It was obvious that either our order got misplaced or forgotten because other tables were getting things brought out. After a decently long wait, the rolls came (and quickly went down the hatch), but no sight of the dinner platters. We had assumed they'd be right behind the rolls but no such luck. It ended up being another 25 minutes from that point. Our waitress was even anxiously checking on where our order was after a point had been reached that it was obvious that something had gone awry.

I think the worst moment was at the end, after our waitress had apologized for the wait for the bulk of our dinner - which she had acknowledged had been too long - when the other waitress came over and snidely asked us why we were in SUCH a rush. Mind you, this is after we've been waiting 45 minutes AFTER the last sign of any food for the rest of our sushi to come. I don't even know what to say to that, to be honest. No, we're not in a rush, we just don't like being forgotten, and we are actually hungry for the food we ordered. Why you'd say that to customers at all, when it isn't your table, I really don't know.

  It was also weird when to apologize for the long wait our waitress brought out edamame ... right with the sushi platters. You know, maybe 20 minutes prior, that would have made some sense. As it was ... we just wanted our fish! 

All in all? We won't be back. And its a shame because the food was good. But our service was terrible. Honestly, from the other reviews, that's a huge anomaly, but ...

The ceiling tiles looked like they were almost falling out and obviously have been there since opening 50 years plus - they should invest some of their monies in a renovation. The overall impression of the restaurant was one of darkness  - a table next to us used a flashlight to look at the menu.The waitress was ok but there were long lapses between our courses. The amuse bouche, or whatever it was supposed to be,  reminded me of Hardtacks from the British Navy - inedible. 

The steaks were ok but nothing  special, the accompanying french onion  soup was a disaster - lukewarm and watery with a glob of cheese - and the salad was ok but clearly had been prepared some time ago - limp lettuce etc. The whole process reminded us of a carefully orchestrated show but without any fine dining pretensions. The room  was crowded and quite noisy and not conducive to an intimate dinner. After our dinner we took the tour of the kitchen and wine cellar . The kitchen clearly is not something you would see in  a fine dining establishment where the personal touch of an inventive and creative  chef is felt - this is an assembly line - my wife called it cafeteria style. The wine cellar is impressive and we would like to live in it for a week or so to enjoy some of the rarer choices.
The upstairs desert rooms are interesting and I was able to enjoy some calvados. 

Overall, this is an old style restaurant that is resting on its laurels - if you want a ""bigger is better"" restaurant with standard steak house fare in a carefully orchestrated environment than this is the place for you. By the way, don't worry about the dress code as shown on their web site. When we were there most men  did not wear a jacket and my wife said I was the only one she saw with a tie.",25,B,Bern's Steak House,Bern's Steak House,Bern's Steak House Inc.,3.0

"99.99% of the time when a place is rated #1 on Yelp, you know you're going to find something amazing.  I didn't.  Sorry.  This pizza was just so average that I have been bummed for the past hour since eating it.  I don't know why I hadn't done a specific search for pizza on Yelp since moving to Tampa, but I did tonight.

I was at work and read about the enormous pizza slices and the legendary oversize pizza.  I couldn't wait to punch out and do the drive over the Gandy to Dale Mabry.  My mouth watered.  I was excited.  Love to find new great pizza.  I walked in and saw the Yankees hats strewn across the ceiling.  I'm a Red Sox fan, but I was willing to overlook their poor taste in athletics.  After all New York City gave the world its amazing pizza as a global apology for A-Rod and the Yankees.

The staff was friendly.  There were no dine in customers at 7pm on a Saturday night. That struck me as odd.  Just 3 customers grabbing to go orders.  I saw one guy leave with one of the enormous pizzas.  It barely fit through the door without having to tilt the box.

OK, the pizza.  It was just... ok.  It's terribly thin.  You only have one choice... fold it.  If you try to hold it traditionally, it'll fall all over you.  Definitely not a pizza to eat while driving.  Because the pizza is so thin, it only supports a microscopic amount of sauce and cheese.  I LOVE lots of sauce.  That's probably why I just found this pizza so bland and forgettable.

The cheese is sparse.  The pepperoni was just passable.  It was thin too.  I guess the biggest positive was the size of the pizza for the price.  A cheese slice is $2.  But sadly, that's all it really was worth.  Was expecting a lot more after seeing this place rated so high.",36,C,Paci's Pizza,Paci's Pizza,Paci's Pizza,3.0

What the last post read is exactly true (see below) - it is awful, the owner a lunatic and the bathroom is not clean. Read the last post below...could not be better stated; thought it was an experience of racism, it was so unbelievable the experience of this guy, but evidently the guy is just nuts. DO NOT GO THERE!

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The Owner of the store is a COMPLETE JACKASS.. I recommend never EVER using this location unless you don't mind dealing with a person who clearly doesn't know how to run a business.  I was having a hard time getting a hold of the Brandon location to place an order.  I have called before to another location and they were able to transfer me just fine.  I called the Tampa location to see if they wouldn't mind connecting me with the Brandon location to place my order.  The man who picked up the phone had an extremely raspy voice and sounded like he was a hardass.  Well I proceeded to let him know why I called and as fast as he could get it out of his mouth and in the most ugliest way he could day it he says ""No Ma'am this is Downtown can't help ya sweetheart"" CLICK  didn't even hesitate just hung up the phone.  Who the hell does that who is running a ""good"" business??? I called back because I was planning another question to ask but he so rudely hung up.  Now when I called back it took 10 rings just for someone to pick up.  It was of course someone else.  A female.. I asked her who just picked up the line she said the owner, I said whats his name and she just went silent... Why you ask?  Because she already knew what he did.. So I said again what is his name she said I don't want to get into the middle of it.......? Dafuq???? Middle of what this is a business being ran and I have the right to know that.

"I have no idea how I've been in Tampa for over a year and am just trying Jason's our! Shame on me! You have no idea how long I've been looking for a quality corned beef and pastrami sandwich. It's been almost 2 years since I had one from Attman's in Baltimore on ""Corned Beef Row' and they've been the only place that I think offer the same quality sandwich that you can get at Carnegie's in New York.

Enter Jason's Deli! I had the New York Yankee which is 3/4 pound of corned beef and pastrami on rye bread with Swiss cheese and spicy brown mustard. It's so good that I've had three in the time that I've been working on this review. It's hard typing which you have a fistful of corned beef & pastrami sandwich. From the moment you walk in, the place is clean and inviting and the staff is friendly but not over-the-top with it.

They're salad bar is limitless with is a welcome addition and the selection of things to top yours or your sandwich with is mind blowing. I'm not fond of the prepackaged pickle they give you because they're on the smallish side and if you're a serving of great sandwiches, the pickle has to hold up its end of the marriage. Fresh whole pickles that you can select from a barrel and have it sliced in front of you! That's how you do it.

All-in-all, I give Jason's a cool 4 stars , I'd have made it 4 1/2 but that's not possible on yelp! I will definitely return!",37,C,Jason's Deli,Jason's Deli,jason's deli,4.0

"My wife and I happened to be in the Westchase area last night and decided to give the Zen Bistro Grill & Sushi Bar a try and I must say we were not disappointed.  This is a trendy looking bistro with a nice size outdoor patio that has enough variety on their menu to accommodate most palates.  Our waiter, Victor, was very pleasant and gave us plenty of time to peruse the many menu choices as well as offering some suggestions.

We started out with the Hama Kama which is a grilled hamachi (yellowtail) cheek served with a ponzu sauce served on top of some greens and a sweet kabayaki sauce.  This was absolutely delicious!  The hamachi was grilled perfectly and very tender and juicy and the ponzu sauce complimented it nicely.

Next up we ordered a few rolls, the Volcano, the Rock n' Zen, the Kamikaze and the Siddhartha.  They were all tastefully executed, nicely plated and had a wonder mix of flavors that all sang together in unison.  The Kamikaze and Siddhartha were spicy rolls but had just the right amount of heat.  Sometimes sushi chefs are heavy-handed on the sauces, especially the spicy aioli, but here the rolls were sauced perfectly.

I look forward to our next visit so that we can explore more of the menu options which all sounded mouthwatering.

Not enough pasta in the world would ever be enough for me to come back here or suggest to any of my friends to continue dining there.

Healthy fast food. That's an oxymoron like Microsoft Works. 

Ah! But in fact this IS a healthy fast food restaurant. The burgers taste legit, and the fries are very tasty. And--confession--one of my favorite things about Evos is its selection of four different ketchups. Mmm. I don't usually eat ketchup with fries, but I basically utilize my fries as ketchup spoons when I'm eating at Evos.

Minus one star for being too expensive (which nearly disqualifies it as being fast food). Minus half a star for trying to look like its from the year 2032.

The waitress made some excuse about the grill giving problems, but our sandwiches had grilled meats as well so it really made no sense. After several complaints, we told the waitress that if the missing food does not come out in one minute please cancel as we wanted to  go home. At that point,the the rest of the party had finished their food.  Finally, 10 minutes later, the second plate came out. The waitress said she would gladly take it off the bill. Then walks in the owner like tornado, randomly asking people where they parked there car? She comes over, apologizes for the delay BLAMES THE WAITRESS FOR BEING NEW.

"Happy to give this friendly establishment a refreshing new review by giving them a second chance. The owner listened and even called to ask for my suggestions. Now, listening and being proactive about what a customers expectation for quality food and service should be in my book highly comended. They have made me a returning customer to this establishment as I am at several of the local establishments.

1st and foremost the Meat Lovers pizza my husband received was delectable and full of meat and as we asked for cheese on top so all the delicious meat stayed well within biting range and not towards the plate the message was received and taken into consideration.

2nd The personal cheese pizza for my son and BBQ pizza for my son was mouthwatering tgat tgey had too have more than two slices the amount of sauce and cheese is exactly what a pizza should have!

3rd Ordered the Chicken Parmigian sub was one of the best subs I have had in a long time. Publix has nothing on yhis Chicken Parm. so get it now! I can still taste the marinara sauce topped with plentiful mozzarella and even parmeasan cheese making it taste out of this world. When we order again I will be ordering this sub! Def. try it!

4th The Mild wings and Parmeasan wings were delicious its football season and who doesnt eat wings without pizza. Try them both as they will fall off of the bone with flavor

We cant wait to try out different wings, subs, and pizzas next time! My wishes for their success and putting the customer 1st.",13,A,Pitza Pizza,Pitza Pizza,Pitza Pizza,5.0

My experience here was pretty mixed. I decided to try this spot for lunch and I'm a huge fan of big bold flavors but my co-worker...not so much. The staff was very polite and to the point to get us our order quickly. I ordered the zucchini pancakes and lentil soup. My co-worker opted for the chicken kebabs with mashed potatoes. I somewhat enjoyed the zucchini pancakes but they were mushy and not worth the $8. The lentil soup was pretty bland and consisted so much of potato that I would have believe it was an orange potato soup vs lentil. In contrast to my meal my friends chicken kebabs were cooked perfectly and well spiced in my opinion. The only problem is that my lunch date can't take the least bit of spice due to stomach issues which was explained to the waitress who still encouraged the chicken instead of steering her in a more bland direction.

"Cute little place in downtown Tampa to grab a quick bite. 

I ordered the Shake and the beef curry bowl. The rice bowl came with miso soup. The food was ready within a few minutes (I'm assuming the beef curry is kept in a slow cooker in the back) and packaged well for taking home. I was given two napkins and a fork and spoon (no chopsticks, not sure why I wasn't offered). 

The Shake was very good. The salmon was nicely seasoned, as was the rice. They use the same fancy plastic wrapping that Noble Market uses/used to keep the seaweed crisp until you are ready to eat. Follow the numbered pulls to extricate the seaweed. 

The bowl was okay. It was heavy on the rice and curry sauce, light on the beef. They included pickles with it, and I found the pickles a little sweeter than I'd like (I like the really sour Japanese pickles or pickled ginger when I eat Japanese curry). No veggies with the bowl, and only the faintest traces of onion in the curry. I would have liked some potato or carrot.

The proprietor said that they are working on new items including a chicken teriyaki burger in a rice bun. If it's anything like the rice bun snacks I've had in Asia, I'm intrigued.

"My new favorite pizza place in the Carrollwood area. Not only is the pizza great, but the Owner is awesome! 

My boss actually discovered this place, so when we needed pizza & salad for an office lunch, he recommended we try here. I placed our order online, but for some reason, the order page would not accept one of the pizzas I was trying to add to my cart. No biggie, after I ordered I just called the store to see if he could change it.  ""No problem!"" from the Owner.  Also, he wondered if I would like our salad chopped - yes please! And with feta?  Also yes!

The pizzas and salad were ready on time, and the Owner carried all four pizzas out to my car.  I couldn't wait to get back to the office and dig in.  The Godfather pizza was probably my favorite - the meats on it were delicious.  And I really liked the Mediterranean pizza, which I got with a thin crust.

"One of my favorite restaurants to go to because of two of my favorite foods being served under one roof: Pizza and Cheesecake!!! Grimaldi's makes thin crust New York style pizzas. Apparently they use New York water in order to create authentic tasting New York pizza dough. The results are delicious. I get a nice thin crust that's crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside. I'm a sucker for white pizza, so I either choose their Quattro Formaggio or the Classic White with garlic. Both are different in that the latter is your usual white pizza while for the former as more bite to it from the gorgonzola cheese. My pizza that I got today was the Quattro Formaggio with ricotta cheese (an extra $2). The four cheeses melted together perfectly creating this creamy texture from the ricotta and the sharp flavor from the gorgonzola. I had the personal pizza with every intent to eat it all, but my twin, who is a picky eater, had two slices. Of course, my visit is never complete without their cheesecakes! They are some of the freshest, creamiest cheesecakes around and come in a variety of flavors depending on the season. Every January so far, they've carried my favorite of all time, their amaretto cheesecake made with amaretto cookie crust, amaretto New York cheesecake, toasted almonds and whipped cream. Creamy, not too sweet, with some fluffy texture as the fork rakes through the cake. I love the slightly browned top of the cheesecake filling.

Went there on a Tuesday night for a lite night dinner because it is the only place downtown to get food after 10 (Five Guys was closed).  We walk in and its hard to tell if the place is open for business or if they are remodeling inside because the waiting staff out number the guests 5 to 1.  With that in mind, you would think service would be unreal.  Not exactly.  Ordered a vodka with fresh lime juice, "" Can you please squeeze real limes?""  ""No problem.""  Sure enough, it came back with Rose's imitation syrup squirted in.  It's the principal alone that is annoying.

"This review is based strictly on service.
After having a shit morning myself, I have to say this experience was the tip of the iceberg for me.

I walked in to be ""greeted"" by someone that seemed to be IMMEDIATELY irritated by the fact that I was there.
I say ""greeted"" because she simply just starred at me waiting for an order without any verbal greeting at all.
Probably the second costumer of the day and things were already sour.
As she continued to stare at me I said ""hi, how are you today?"" And she continued to ignore me then asked what I wanted.

She gave extremely small portions of everything I ordered, and I nicely asked if it was possible to have a little more so she yelled to the cashier to charge me double.

Almost to completion of my burrito, the only words I got from her were ""Anything else?""

The cashier was sweet, patient with the exact cash protocol (which also wasn't brought to my attention until checkout).
Even opened my coke for me (the cashier being so kind was the only reason I didn't leave me food there and leave)

Then while cashing out, middle of a conversation with the cashier, the lady RUDELY yelled ""do you want a bag?"".
At first I wasn't certain she was speaking to me, considering I was discussing change options at the register.
But she made sure to repeat it again even louder than the first time.

Not to mention she verbally announced how ""irritated"" she was in the middle of making the customer behind me's order.

So I'll leave her with some advice.
As someone in The service industry myself, customer service and attitude are EXTREMELY important.
You're human, you're allowed to be upset and irritated and pissed off.. but when a PAYING CUSTOMER is in your presence, that changes IMMEDIATELY.

And if hiding those emotions isn't something that you're capable of, then this industry isn't for you.",25,B,Chipotle Mexican Grill,Chipotle Mexican Grill,Chip0tle Mexican Grill,2.0

BUT the food was truly worth the wait! We tried the ginger chick-un, sunrise burger and house burger, and all three were excellent. The burgers were extremely flavorful, and the ""very believable bacon"" made all the difference.

"Thai Market & Kitchen. The name pretty much says it all, but that's not all. While this place has been here for years, it has undergone renovations that have really improved this market over the past three years.  New owner in 2007.

They expanded the building to offer more variety of Thai grocery products, added a small restaurant, and they even have a nice plant and flower selection in the front porch area. I even remember that the old sign (if there was one) was barely noticeable. Now they have a perfectly nice sign. 

Yes, it is not very big compared to most chain Asian supermarkets across the country, but heck, even SF doesn't have a Thai market. And don't mention the Thai market in Berkeley....not enough Thai products. 

This place offers the essentials, as well as small gift items (Thai movies, clothes, cards, etc.) . They also have really great customer service (very family like). 

It's been great watching this place grow and improve. I only regret not reviewing this place first. : ( Settle for number two.

My top favorite are the Bulgoki beef lunch box and fish cake soup. The box got rice, slice beef, dumpling, kimchi and others. It was so good I don't mind have it for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The broth of the soup was tasty ( better drink it when warm) and the different shape of fish cake got wonderful texture and flavor. There was one row of table and chairs for dine in.

If you like mussels, theirs are amazing!!! The chicken wings, chips and queso are also favorites. The queso is made with beer which gives it a nice twist.

"Came here a few times already and it's not a bad place.  Plenty of TVs to watch and the service was pretty good.  Every time I came here I got wings, it's called Wild Wing so figure that's what I should be getting.

They do have alot of different types of wing, I did a quick count last time and I think it was 30-40 flavors.  Since it's so many flavors, what my friends and I did was each person order something different and everyone share the wings.  Makes it easier for the waiters instead of telling them you like 1/3 this and 1/3 that etc.

So far I tried the standard medium and hot.  Bubba's bbq, Raging Cajun, Island and the Garlic.  The Cajun and Island probably top my list follow by the bbq.  If you really like garlic well you have your garlic wings here to try.  I'm not sure if it was just that day, but the garlic one was a little too strong for me.  If you're on a date, I strongly recommend on staying away, unless you two have that kind of thing going.

I'm not sure if they do it anymore, but last time I was there they had special things going on every night.  Like buy at least 12 wings and get next 12 half off or something.  They also have things for kids I think.  When I went they had an xbox 360 hooked up for guitar hero and kids were playing it on the big screen, the one you see when you first walk in.  Not sure if it's kids only thing so if you feel like playing, um go ahead?

If you are hungry the Kota may not put you over the top, but the bigger sandwiches may be much for some. Good flavor but needed something to pick it up like cilantro, peppers, something. 

Kota is 1/2 size of regular wiches but cored and filled. Chips were sweet and crispy. Kota was $6 so I opted to try a Lychee Lemonade instead of trying the Smashed Balls, too, not knowing the size of either. Refreshing drink with 3 lychees inside. yum.

"I LOVE Tropical Smoothie. My loyalty is long for them every since my first visit in Panama City (where I'm from) about 14 years ago.

I found myself downtown in Tampa wanting a smoothie, and what do you know, I stumble upon this beauty. I was stocked to go in for my Peanut Paradise. I ordered (no turbinado, no yogurt, add honey, add extra PB) and it ended up being delish from the first slurp. However, I won't EVER come back to this location. Why? The horrible customer service...

Long story short, there are 5 girls working when I walk in. Everyone is on their phone except one who is literally sitting on the counter top, eating chips that TP sales! So whatever, I place my order and everyone just stands there! Yes, they are all still on their phone (and eating). 

The young lady who took my order had to ask one of her fellow co-workers to make my order. But it gets better...a couple walks in after me to order, it's not a pre-called in pick up, and gets their smoothies before me! Mind you...3 out of the 5 still have their heads buried in their phone.

She knew I was up to something sinister and that I was talking about a place we had either joked about or that she claimed she would never eat at. So after noodling it for a few seconds, she exclaimed, ""Oh hells no! I'm not eating from no gas station!"" So to the gas station I drove!

Bruno's NY Brick Oven Pizza (not associated with the Bruno's on Waters & Armenia) is in an unfortunate location, seemingly. For quite some time now, we have been getting car washes on ""lazy Sundays"" at the Flipper's wash next to the Shell. Not so long ago, we noticed that the freestanding building sandwiched between the Shell and Flipper's was transforming from dry cleaners to pizzeria. We both vowed we wouldn't eat there once it opened because of its close proximity to it's neighbors. But oh how hunger changes things! It's been about 3 months now and we're in love with their pizza. The fresh tomato taste in their sauce and their perfectly-cooked crust keeps you wanting to come back for more. I'm certain they're not using the high-quality Grande mozzarella, but that's okay. The pizza is good and most definitely the best NY pie in NW Hillsborough. Best part... They deliver to all of Westchase.

Lastly, don't sleep on their garlic knots and antipasto salad! Both menu items are very good.  I haven't tried a sub yet, but that's on my list of things to do.",7,A,Bruno's NY Brick Oven Pizza,Bruno's NY Brick Oven Pizza,Brun0's NY Brick Oven Pizza,4.0

If you blinked when you were driving up to it, you'd miss it. When you do find it, you'll walk into dim lit brown and black modern decor with a nice big flat screen on the wall displaying just some of their food options.

I ordered an appetizer of Mini Tequenos for the table and another buddy of mine had the calamari. Both fried to a golden brown. The calamari was not too chewy and the cheese in the Tequenos was creamy on the inside. My entre was the Arepas El Sabor, it doesn't look that big, but it was filling. With perfectly grilled tender chicken and steak, it made a great meal with the creamy toasted on the outside arepa and avocado slices accompanying them. It did come with chorizo on the side, but it was a little cold and lacked any bite of chorizo I've had at other restaurants.

"True New York style customer service lol. 

I ordered 2 hot dogs with onions and mustard and they gave me two plain hot dogs but charged me for sauerkraut. Pretty sure the girl at the register didn't know the different between sauerkraut and onions and cooked onions. Isn't sauerkraut made of cabbage? I'm not German but I think I know that much. Anyway she was young so I'll just excuse her for that. The hot dogs were good once they figured it out and gave me a dollar out the tip jar for overcharging me. Oh and I got free fries. Or did they charge me for fries? I'm really not sure but I didn't order the fries.

Anyway I'm giving them 4 stars because although they made a ton of mistakes they did work out in my favor and I did get free fries (I think) and everything tasted good. When you're craving a nitrate filled hot dog, it should taste good.

The corn dogs were cooked in their doughnut batter. My husband didn't like them at all; I kind of enjoyed the sweetness, but not enough to eat a whole one.

They have a wide assortment of dried spices, snacks, produce, refrigerated, and frozen foods. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to find fish tamarind a.k.a.

Everyone here was very friendly and it's definitley nice to have friendly faces when you get off a plane or are waiting for a plane like I am. The only critique I have is that they should put a please wait to be seated sign in the front because a lot of people were just walking in and confused if the greeter was  taking another group to a table.

"Sub Shak is a true local gem located along Gunn Highway in southern Carrollwood. Owners Wendy & Jerry Crabb have had the place since 1996, and they've got the whole family involved in making sandwiches and visiting with their customers. 

This is a small, family-owned, locals-favorite restaurant. They're always busy at lunch time, but it's much less crowded in the evenings. They serve hot subs (including Cubans), cold subs, salads, and party platters.

My favorite part of the restaurant is their dedication to the local Tampa sports teams -- you'll see a lot of signed photos and mementos all over the walls. Wendy also takes great joy in decorating their place for a favorite customer's birthday, or for an upcoming Holiday. I snapped a photo of her Easter display and you'll find that in the pictures from the restaurant.

Tonight I had the Supreme Italian cold cut sub special with chips and a drink. The sub was served on a toasted whole wheat sub roll with ham, pepperoni, capicola, Genoa & cotto salami plus provolone cheese, lite Italian dressing, lettuce, tomatoes and onions.

I came for chicken, because everything else in your menu, including your desserts I can cook at home.

"In late July, we had a staycation at the beautiful Le Meridien Hotel. With our accommodations we were given complimentary admission to the Tampa Museum of Art. My boyfriend at the time was suddenly called back to Orlando on business, so I decided to celebrate Sunday Funday by myself.

After touring the Tampa Museum of Art, I wandered into the gift shop located on the first floor. Sono Cafe is located downstairs adjacent to the gift shop.

It was time for an afternoon snack, so I decided to try Sono Cafe out. What a delightful surprise this quaint cafe turned out to be! 

The restaurant was fairly empty and I chose a table outside. I was lucky that day because it was overcast and not too humid. There was quite a breeze that day too, due to an impending storm. Bad weather or not, the beautiful view of Downtown Tampa, the Hillsborough River, and Tampa's Riverwalk was worth dining here. 

When I checked in on Yelp, I was so happy to see that Sono Cafe offered a free glass of wine for checking in!

I ordered a Spanish Tempranillo and a Smoked Salmon Brunch Plate. The Smoked Salmon Plate was made of House Cured Salmon, Capers, Pickled Red Onion, Marscapone, and was served with Pumpernickel Bread.

The wine and the Smoked Salmon were both delicious. The portion of the brunch plate was perfect for a quick afternoon snack. 

The staff here is friendly and attentive. The seating is limited both indoors and on the patio, but the winning factor here are the gorgeous views. Also, you can dine at Sono Cafe without actually touring the TMOA.

The beef was def better and stronger tasting, but it was almost too beefy. There wasn't enough anything else. Not enough bun, sauce, lettuce, etc. I don't like the burger to stick out a centimeter beyond the bun. They really need to put a hearty piece of lettuce and tomato on there! And a good amount of sauce. Come on now. If we want sauce then do it! I like their fries. But I'll be going back to the regular double cheeseburger from now on. 

I'm not sure what their true identity is. Overall I like it alright bc I like burgers but for some reason it's missing, what the French call, a certain ""I don't know what."" Fix the burger to bun ratio on the brisket and increase the amount of toppings and that will help. 

Btw, I called in and ordered a to go order. When i arrived 20 min later, there was a decent size line and I go straight up to an open register and say I'm here for my food.

It wasn't long before my entree arrived. The colors were vibrant, the portion huge, and the smell enticing. My only criticism is of the marinara. It's very sweet, and I like my sauces more earthy. The chicken was pounded nice and thin and was breaded and fried perfectly. The waiter brought a shaker with extra parmesan as well, which seems to be real cheese, as they had kept it in the refrigerator. The house-made mozzarella on top was delicious! I found this dish and the appetizer to be under-salted, so if you're watching your sodium intake but love Italian food, this might be the place for you! Luckily, there is a sea salt grinder on the table for people like me.

There's also a shot of espresso included with the meal. I found it to be very watery and more like drip coffee. I've had Italian espresso, and this was nowhere close. Despite this, I had a good experience and wouldn't mind going back to try other options. 

Lastly, don't be a derp like me and try to open a street-facing door to get inside. The entrance is in the alley!",7,A,Oggi Italian,Oggi Italian,Oggi It@li@n,4.0

At other places where that happened, we at least got an apology  & comp drink or app.  It is just good business to try to win the food will of first-time visitors.

We then had to go through the point & Spanglish effort of ordering...and the server had to keep going back to the owner to check and several things were not available tonight.

"I stopped in here for a quick lunch while I was serving jury duty at the nearby District Courthouse. I was sat very promptly, and my order was taken quickly.

If you order an entrée, even at lunch, it comes with a cup of soup and spring roll. Those dishes also came out quickly. The spring roll was small but decent, while the soup was just salty chicken broth with a scoop of rice thrown in.

My meal took quite some time to come out. I ordered the tofu and vegetable stir fry, and it was quite a disappointment. There were about five pieces of tofu, and the vegetables were overwhelmingly sliced carrots.  Had the sauce been good, that still would have been okay, but the sauce was almost flavorless, and embarrassingly watery. Plus, after such a long wait, the dish was not served hot.

It took quite some time to get checked out, so my quick lunch ended up being about 50 minutes. This is one of those places that I've been wanting to try for some time, but I will be in no rush to go back.",31,C,Si-Am Thai,Si-Am Thai,Si-Am Th@i,3.0

"We're in love. Housed in an old bungalow in the middle of Hyde Park, this  place allows -encourages! Diners to bring their own bottles of wine -No Corking Fee! They'll chill it for you and bring out glasses while you're waiting for a table. About waiting for a table...It's best to get to dinner there as early in the evening as you can, as they get really swamped from 7pm to close. If you can't make it early, be sure to bring that bottle of wine and expect to wait about 30 minutes.

That's nice, but what about the food? Excellent. If my grandmother wasn't crazy, this is the kind of food she would make. Comfort food at its finest with a menu that changes every week. You can expect to see things like Chicken Marsala, Meatloaf, Crab Cakes, Mac and Cheese, etc.

"12/20/2020 at 12pm. Beyond rude 'lady that wouldn't give me her name' said I would have to pay for a sandwich that she only put the meat on bc I asked ""that is that the last of your chicken?"" She said yes. Well I continued to say I didn't want that sandwich then. They didn't have any other fresh chicken for my chicken teriyaki!! She told me I'd have to pay for the sandwich. I said absolutely not bc I don't like how your chicken looks!! I asked for her name and she said ""I dont have to give you my name."" I asked her if they wear name badges (bc she was not). No reply. I asked what her employee number is so I can refer to her and she said NO. I asked what is the store number. She said it's on the front of the building. And it's not. Look at pic I posted. After cashing out, I saw this RUDE subway lady wrap up the sandwich I said I didn't want, put it in a bag, and took it in the back. I probably provided her free lunch for the day!!! On Mon I will be calling and speaking to the owner and corporate office about this RUDE WHITE LADY THAT HAS A THICK ACCENT. MY GUESS IS RUSSIAN. She clearly doesn't have ANY customer service.

"I took a walk to the Tampa Downtown Market today and was surprised to see a new café opening near the corner of Tampa Street and Madison.  There were a couple of employees standing out in front of the place handing out menus and explaining to some other passersby that this café wasn't open quite yet, but they were giving out free samples.  I overheard this and walked on, thinking it was great to see another place open downtown and taking a mental note to check it out in the near future.

On second thought, I decided to turn back and pick up a menu.  One of the employees was happy to oblige, and invited me inside to partake in the free preview of Inside The Box Café.  The free samples they were offering weren't just a taste; they were whole meals!  I needed lunch and didn't have any money, so this seemed almost providential.  I gladly stepped inside.

The café was decorated nicely in fresh, crisp shades of green and orange.  The dining area was immaculate and welcoming, and it immediately impressed me as a nice place to get a quick, healthy lunch.  Upon closer inspection of the wall art, I noticed that this was no ordinary local sandwich shop.  Inside the Box Café is associated with Metropolitan Ministries, and the proceeds from each meal purchased goes to feed someone in need.  It's like the Toms Shoes concept, but with food, and it's a genius idea.

The food here was mostly pre-made, pre-packaged and displayed in a glass case under the front counter.  Inside the Box actually began as a catering endeavor, and the nature of the food service here seems to be highly influenced by that side of the business.  Some food snobs might be tempted to turn their nose up at this and head over to Fresh for a made-to-order sandwich, but let's face it: most of us getting lunch downtown are on the move and don't have time to wait.  We want a satisfying meal that will get us back to work on time.  I decided to view the quick-serve nature of this place as an asset and reserve judgment on the food until I actually tasted it.

At the recommendation of one of the friendly menu-hander-outers (and this would have been my choice anyway), I ordered Box Lunch #1 with a turkey club, white-chocolate-macadamia-nut cookie and Coke Zero.  I was served within about a minute and a half, and I carried my lunch over to nearby Lykes Gaslight Park to enjoy it with this amazing January weather.

The sandwich was overall very good.  I prefer my ciabatta harder and crustier on the outside, but the turkey was delicious with the smoked gouda, and those flavors were accented nicely by the herb aioli and applewood bacon.  The organic greens added a touch of class to the sandwich and set it apart from your ordinary grab-and-go turkey club.   This may have been a pre-made item, but the quality and freshness of the ingredients made it clear that this sandwich had been handcrafted the same day. The cookie was delicious as well, and a good size.  

All things considered, based on my preview experience, Inside the Box is a place I heartily recommend.  Although some may ultimately prefer the made-to-order experience of a place like Fresh or flee to the familiarity of a chain like Subway or Jimmy John's, I call upon those people to give this place a shot.  For around the same price as Subway or Jimmy John's, not only will you receive a quick, quality meal, but you will provide a meal to someone in need.  With the slogan, ""A Meal For You, A Meal For Them,"" one might expect to pay a high price to support such a great cause, or that the owners would cut corners in order to finance the philanthropic side of their mission.  At Inside the Box Café today, those notions were squashed.",0,A,Inside the Box Café,Inside the Box Café,inside the box café,5.0

"I believe this may be the original Outback Steakhouse. I think that Outback is to blame for my Steak Addiction. I got hooked before I was old enough to drive. Now, more than 15 years later, I still love that juicy steak like it was the first time I tasted it. Instinctively, I always go with Victoria's Filet, a Loaded Baked Potato, and a Caesar Salad. I usually get a Fosters, Australian for beer, to wash it down. And when I am feeling extra greedy, I will start off with a Bloomin' Onion. But if you do that be careful, those Bloomin' Onions have been known to ruin an appetite or two.

I have been to this location a few times. The staff have always been professional and friendly. I have never had any problems. The food is usually speedy. I have dined at the bar and in a booth, service is good at both. The only complaint that I have is the parking lot. It is not large enough for the crowd. Luckily, it probably keeps the wait times inside to a minimum. 

If you love steaks and you are stuck up about them, then Outback's chain steakhouse menu may not make you super thrilled. But if you love steak and can put up with the chain vibe, then you should really like Outback. It is my favorite chain steakhouse.

"This was our second visit here and I didn't realize until now that I didn't do a review the first time so this essentially covers both visits. Our first time the food was excellent as was the service. I had the Cuban sandwich and my wife had the mojo chicken sandwich. Both were huge portions and tasty as well. As stated, the service was good and attentive. However, our second visit this week left us a little disappointed. It took a while for our server to get to our table once we were seated. Someone did come over and let us know he would be over soon and, in fairness,  that is what happened. By that point we were ready to order so we ordered our food and drinks. The drinks came out fairly quickly but the food took a while. Our server came by to tell us it would be out soon and a few minutes after that it did. I had ordered the mahi-mahi sandwich and my wife had the Cuban sandwich. Both were good although I thought the mahi portion was a little small. The Cuban was the same as what I remembered from our first visit (excellent). After finishing our server brought the check. However, he then disappeared and never came back. After about 10 minutes I took the check to the hostess to try to get help. She took my card and the check in back and several minutes later she brought the bill along with my card. There was never any explanation as to what happened to our server and we never saw him again. We paid the bill and left but it left us disappointed as the first visit went so well.

"This is a really nice market for any produce from Asia.  But, I would not drive out of my way to go here.  It just so happens to be close to one of my favorite Indian restaurants, so sometimes I stop by out of convenience.

The major things to note about this market compared to other shops in Tampa is:
1. Larger selection of spiritual, personal care, and beauty products.
2. Variety of teas
3. Produce specials

As others have noted, the market is super clean.  However, just like any local market, make sure to check the expiration dates on all of the items before you buy them.  

Typically, when I shop at 27 Mart, I stock up on dry spice mixes that are noted for specific dishes.  They come in a box with the name of the dish and a photo on the outside.  Sometimes they are on sale for $0.99, and it is enough seasons to use for two meals.

The service was fast, I give it that much, they got to the hotel in under 30 minutes (Domino's take note), but that was the only thing that was good with this place.  The pizza was definitely in the category of ""worst pizza ever"".

"I've been a fan of Buddy Brew since we moved here from Seattle; their original store on W. Kennedy - which has since expanded -  has that authentic coffeehouse feel.  And the coffee, which they roast themselves, is outstanding. 

Over the past few years, BB has expanded both its brand and its locations; you can even buy Buddy Brew beans in your local Publix. 

I was therefore very happy and enthused to see that Buddy Brew had opened a store in the newly remodeled Park Tower on Tampa Road.  This is a very busy building with a lot of traffic, so I was interested in seeing how crowded the shop would be and how they utilized their space. 

First, the shop itself is on the minimalist side: its ethos fits in with the sleek new lobby - glass, brushed nickel, marble, wood.  The coffee bar sits in the center of the space - in the form of a square - and there is seating on either end, either with a view of the street or in the back for a more quiet conversation.

Now to service and the coffee itself.  Service was friendly, quick, and efficient.  No sooner had I paid then my coffee was ready at the other end of the bar.  I ordered a drip, so a pour-over or latte would take longer, of course.  Nevertheless, they had 2 folks working the bar, so I wouldn't expect a long wait.

Overall, I am very happy to have another excellent - and unique - coffee option in downtown Tampa.  Buddy Brew has become a Tampa icon, and this store is a reflection of their high standards.",2,A,Buddy Brew Coffee - Park Tower,Buddy Brew Coffee - Park Tower,Buddy Br3w Coff33 - Park Tow3r,5.0

"After eating here I'm thinking that ""French Cuisine"" is forever off of my list.  My friends, who live in Tampa, were excited to try it so we went for brunch.  There was a 15 minute wait, but that was no big deal as you can look at their delicious desserts in the display cases while waiting.  When our table was ready we started looking at the menu, having a difficult time on deciding what to order.  I finally chose the Power Sandwich, Egg White Scramble, aged Cheddar, Roasted Tomato, Organic Arugula, Turkey Bacon served on a Baguette.  I asked if it came with fries or potatoes and was told no, everything was a la carte.  Wait....you're charging me how much for a simple sandwich and it doesn't come with anything???  One of my friends ordered the Smoked Salmon Benedict and the other ordered the Short Ribs Benedict.  Again, high price items with NO sides.  Literally, benedict on a plate.  They found them not very tasty due to the Lemon-Thyme Scone they are served on.  Who serves Benedict on a scone??  They were dry and crumbled which made getting a bite to stick on a fork impossible.  The server never asked if we wanted anything to drink besides water.  I ordered a Diet Coke and had to keep asking for a refill.  My pet peeve, a server should always keep an eye on a glass and never let it be empty.  My friends had to stick to the warm bottle of water that they leave on the table.  No ice...just room temperature water.  Overpriced food, small portion size and servers who don't seem to care.  We will not be returning.",32,C,Piquant,Piquant,Piquant,1.0

This place rocks. This place is amazing. This place is heaven on earth. This place is like being in Miami without having to be in Miami. This might be the best hotel adjacent dining experience in Florida. This is my favorite February excursion of 2021...and I went to Bern's for the first time soooo that says a lot. 

Basically the music is my favorite part. The atmosphere overall is breathtaking. Instead of just making it another trendy shop they really paid attention to details, it's more transformative than anything. And even being such a vibrant amazing place to be in it is still completely conducive for work! Which makes it an ideal business center for the Haya hotel. There are plenty of outlets, a speedy internet connection, and the temperature is refreshingly comfortable. 

I enjoyed an almond milk cappuccino and the chicken empanada. The prices are totally fair, expensive for an empanada but totally approachable considering it is a hotel outlet! The milk options are limited to oat, almond, and whole. While I wish there was more diversity (hello yes, this is a full hotel and restaurant I know you have regular old 2% hiding back there somewhere) I am glad to see the non dairy alternatives. 

The service is really quite nice as well. It isn't full service as you do have to walk up to get things but it is plated for you and the silverware is wrapped. I appreciated the small touches that make this so elevated. 

There is a lot of street parking for us locals. There is no need to pay for the all day lot. Just head down towards HCC.

The baklava appetizer is worth the try. A very nice twist with cheese. 
Lobster and crap pasta had an excellent sauce, worthy of the waiter's comment about wanting to drink it in a glass. 
Pork chop was undercooked just like I like but did not ask for!

So I put down my name and was told the wait time would be 20 minutes. 25 minutes later the same exact people were still waiting. I went up to the counter and asked how much longer my wait would be and they told me there was still 5 other groups before me. So I asked how much longer and they didn't know. So basically they just told me 20 minutes without any knowledge of the real wait time. I work in a restaurant and I was appalled at how unprofessional and unorganized this company was. Two groups walked out who had been waiting for over an hour. I asked to speak to the manager and when she came out she told me there was a big group and there orders were all wrong and that was why the whole restaurant was backed up.

"Dig the vibe here at this restaurant located in a nice upper scale strip. 

Damn why do we always get stuck with the waitor in training at the nice restaurants?!?  I was thinking this will either make or break our meal  Either way drinks came on time, apps were ordered things were going good.  

Typsy already bc we predrank before dinner.  The queso fundido arrived, melted cheese w/ hints of peppers and chorizo served w/ salty chips. MMMMM....I wanted to just eat w/ a spoon.  CHEEEEEESE!  Great menu item, would be to use this as a sauce and just pour it over pasta.  Hands down would be a great mac n cheese!

Next came the coconut shrimp in a citrus inspired dipping sauce.  I was expecting better from this they were tasty.  Coconut was almost burnt but they were decent.  I was thinking I should have gone w/ the crab cakes but the table was feeling this more.  Oh well!  :(

I ordered a conch soup to replace the salad for an extra charge and the food runner delivered 3 salads.  I was like sweet they will bring my soup afterwards, well the rookie remembered when the meal came by that time it was too late.  Strike 1!  The salad was a basic Ceaser it was good I liked it.

Then the meal, I dont how the rookie suckered me into ordering this but he said it was full of flavor and its a hit at this place.  Guava Salmon wrapped in Smoked Bacon.  Sounds great and I dont get a lot of Guava in the Chi.  I usually dont like to mix proteins but anything w/ bacon?!?  You cant go wrong.  The fish came out and was fresh, tasty, and everything was cooked properly but the flavors were across the board.  You put all the flavors together and I was wow'd, im more like this kinda works.  Wasnt bad by any means but wasnt great.  I was a lil dissapointed.  Strike 1 1/2!  :)

"I am not a vegan, nor am I hoity-toity for ""organic"" this and ""non-processed"" everything that. lol I am however practical. Not a ""balla shot calla"" where I can throw money everywhere and waste it away here and there, BUT I am willing to shell the dough for great quality products. Now on to my review:

It was our first time there, had no clue what to order, what to try. We've had vegan desserts from other places, but wanted to experience ""Stacy's"" bakery. Read the story online, loved it, and believe in it. Unfortunately, the atmosphere of the place didn't seem that way when we went in. There were two employees there at the time, and neither were warm and welcoming. I felt as if they were distracted with something going on ""behind the scenes"" maybe. lol. They definitely weren't distracted by other customers cause they were only 2 there (including myself) for the whole duration of my visit. The employees just didn't seem happy to be working the Saturday before Halloween. It felt like pulling teeth when having a conversation, there was no nudge/customer interaction with the employees (which could've been a chance for them to sell us products, lol), so we were left to just go for it. lol We tried the:

. Chocolate Cupcake w/Vanilla Frosting - The cake had a chalky texture; frosting was extremely extremely sweet [ maybe it's to try to distract you from the chalkiness of the cupcake =/ ] We only had a one small bite each, so 1/4 of it, and didn't finish the rest. It was that bad. **We've had plenty of vegan chocolate cupcakes since it's my fave, so this was a total bummer =,( not to mention waste of money. So far, Kaleisia Tea Lounge has the best tasting vegan chocolate cupcake.

. Vanilla Cupcake with Strawberry Frosting - The cake had a perfect moist texture, yummy flavor too! Strawberry frosting tasted like store bought processed frosting, nothing special and again overly sweet, so we ended up just eating the cupcake by itself.

. Carrot Cake with Cream Cheese Frosting - This was UHHH-FREAKIN-MAAZZING!!! the cake was totes PERF! Moist yet fluffy texture, not grainy or chalky at all, flavor of the cake was just utter deliciousness! I could legit eat 6 all to myself and just tell myself I had my daily servings of vegetable for the day =D The only downside, was...wait for it... the frosting! lol. It is sooo extremely sweet! We ended up just eating the cupcake by itself. 

. Pumpkin Pie - We have never had vegan pumpkin pie before, so this was interesting. You would think ""pumpkin"" being the main ingredient, it should make sense. lol. Uh no. All I tasted was sugar. The filling was just way to sweet, it's like a sharp sweet. Similar to tasting processed maple syrup on your pancakes at IHOP. The crust wasn't bad though for gluten free. But I've decided to stick to Costco's Pumpkin Pie this year. Surprisingly, that processed pie is not as sweet and gets the job done for the same price.

. Chocolate Chip Ice Cream Sandwich - This was yummy! You'd have to let it thaw for about 15 minutes, but it was actually pretty good. The ice cream was really creamy, perfect amount of sweetness and the chocolate chip cookies were not overly sweet at all. Maybe I'll come back just to try the chocolate chip cookies. 

OVERALL, would we go back? Yes, because we are a firm believer of second chances. We understand that we all have our ""off-days"". Would I make the same amount of purchases? No, we'd probably just go back to try the chocolate chip cookies. But who knows, maybe the employees will have better customer service and entice us to try their other baked goods too ^_~",20,B,Stacy's Gluten Free Goodies,Stacy's Gluten Free Goodies,St@cy's Gluten Free Goodies,2.0

"I received a coupon book about Papa Murphy's Pizza. The coupon book had very few locations and one closer to us is at 5371 Ehrlich Road in Tampa FL. Saturday evening, my wife was hungry for a pizza so I decided to go to Papa Murphy's Pizza located at 5371 Ehrlich Road to order a large Cheese Pizza to go. After paying them $9.00 and when they call my name, I received an uncooked pizza with an instruction to bake it home at 425 F. I had no idea that I  would be coming home with a raw pizza when my wife is hungry. First of all, they should have told me in advance what I would be receiving and had I known it earlier, I would have never paid them in advance and would have either gone to Pizza Hut or Papa John's. 

After waiting for a gas oven to pre-heat to 425 F that took another 12 minutes and then wait another 15 to 18 minutes to bake and the result came out as a frozen chewy pizza that I just purchased from Wal-Mart's Frozen Food section and paid Publix price,

My opinion is that it is not a good place to go if you are hungry and need a quick meal. Should have gone to Papa's John or Pizza Hut which are much closer to my home and their large Pizza with one or two toppings cost only $10.00  and read to eat.",11,A,Papa Murphy's Take 'N' Bake Pizza,Papa Murphy's Take 'N' Bake Pizza,Papa Murphy's Take 'N' Bake Pizza,2.0
"Love this place. Reminiscent of an old school, greasy spoon diner that I loved while living up north in Connecticut, this place has all you could really ask for. Located on Nebraska Ave, it's not the best of areas, but do not let this deter you. It's right across the street from a tire shop and easy to miss if you're speeding down the road. It's a decently sized placed. Not too much seating, and you will probably have to wait a bit especially if going on the weekends. Whenever I go, usually during the week if possible, it's a quick entry and seating.

"We moved to Wesley Chapel in January and one of the selling points is the many many golf courses.  My hubby is an avid golfer and we also are an active family, so having full access to a course with unlimited golf and fitness was hugely appealing.  Additionally, there is a Kids Club where we get 2 hours included a day of childcare.

Right now (as of June 1st) the entire tennis athletic area is being renovated. They are adding a small put put course, water slide and splash pad.  They are gutting the restaurant and adding a brick over pizza option to the grille and putting in cabanas around the pool, which is heated year round.

Because we are under 40, we get a special rate and for us, it is worth it, especially with the social aspect. There are nightly specials at Fazios, they just redid the menu and the staff is amazing.

It is also VERY family friendly which makes it nice since our kiddos are super young and a bit obnoxious.  We like that it has a ""Cheers"" feel at the bar, and familiar faces are always around.  We hope to be able to make friends and grow business network connections as well as enjoy lots of fun activities all summer long.  

I would say the one thing I would like to see is a bit better wine list on the main menu, but outside of that, it is wonderful.  And, of course, we are impatiently waiting for construction to be done at the TAC so we can take full advantage of our membership.  If you are looking for a club and do the golf level, you'll have access to 4 other clubs in the area as well.  We typically don't utilize this but we do enjoy our time at HG.

"Love this little hole-in the wall. This mom and pop Columbian Bakery serves HOME COOKED Columbian style food. It will be a frequent stop for us in the future now. We loved the homemade beef stew (Thursday special only). Number 1 (skirt steak and eggs) is nothing fancy, but for $10 home cooked steak, it was good in our book. The beef empanadas reminded me of home cooking from the old Spanish ladies when I used to visit my friends houses in the Lower East side of NYC. A delicious $1 snack with potatoes in it. The pane du yuca was average. And my favorite was the MANGO juice!! For $2.50, I'm getting it every time!! It tasted of fresh mangos like we were in the streets of Costa Rica and Thailand again.

"I've lived on Cross Creek for a combined 8 years and I have never stepped foot into Capri Pizza. I've always seen it and never thought to visit. I was having a craving for spaghetti out of nowhere. I put spaghetti in my Yelp app and Capri popped up...I said to myself, sure why not. 

I ordered spaghetti with meatballs and a side order of calamari. Everything was cooked fresh to order, which I really appreciated. When I returned for my food they were still working on my calamari, which I found a little strange but I was totally ok with it...I rather have fresh food than stale food. 

When I got home, I saw why I had to wait-the amount of food that you get for the price is astonishing. I couldn't believe how much food I had. I must've eaten off of the food for three days!!

The calamari was fresh off the fryer...it could've used a bit more seasoning to make it more flavorful but after I made my own bang bang sauce...I made it work since it had the most important component...crispiness. 

The spaghetti was delicious as well, I like my spaghetti a little sweet and spicy so some addition of sugar and hot sauce and I was a happy girl. 

Even though I had to doctor the food up a bit, it was still totally worth it. Very affordable, plentiful portions and fresh food.",0,A,Capri Pizza-N-More,Capri Pizza-N-More,Capri Pizza-N-More Inc.,4.0
"This is a fun place for a late dinner while watching whatever is going on in college sports or baseball.

They offer a decent bar, decent prices and decent food.  Do I think anything is extraordinary?  No, but for the price, I don't expect that.

The pork belly and grits appetizer is good enough that I've had it twice.  It does come with way too much grits for an appetizer (it'd be a meal in itself), so I'm never quite hungry for my entree, but darn is that pork belly succulent.

The first time I went to Fire, I had the Dirty Mick burger, and it was too much after sharing the pork belly appetizer.  I found the candied bacon to be too sweet.  The second time I went to Fire, I had the grilled cheese with tomato soup.  I still approached my main course overly sated from the appetizer, but the lighter option was a better choice.  I did find the grilled garlic bread to overwhelm the cheddar cheese, and I couldn't really detect the truffle in the soup, but it all tasted pretty good.  I really want to try the BLTCE, but that would mean that I'd have to control myself and not order the pork belly and grits again.

"My absolute favorite place to go in S. Tampa for tapas.  Ceviche is good for Sunday brunch as well as dinner.  I highly recommend the pork shank, patatas bravas, stuffed red peppers and of course the seafood ceviche.  These are the staples I always order.  The ambiance is fun with music in the bar area or a little quieter in the back area.  

Sunday brunch is a great time to sit outdoors in the nice weather and enjoy the delicious quiche, seafood crepes and apple churros.  

The service tends to be pretty slow and they commonly make mistakes, but the upside is you end up with some items you may not have ordered so you can try more.  They always fix their mistakes and ensure your experience is great.  The service should not stop you from going, it's worth the slow service for the food and experience. However, if you are in a hurry, go somewhere else.

I guess the only downside to the restaurant, but not that if affects me, is that it is small (10-12 tables) and it can get pretty loud it the confined area...especially once a table is a few bottles of wine in (which there is no uncorking fee, btw).

"A fine dining cuisine experience with beautiful modern decor. The food needs to be served a little more warm than what they gave us- we did not make a complaint about it but it definitely should be addressed in future experiences. The service was wonderful and it looked like everyone worked in harmony with each other. This review is based on a November 2021 dining experience. Here is the summary of the taste of the food below.

Manhattan with cherry 3/5
- very small
- Heavy on bitters

Summer Squash smoked ricotta Ravioli 3/5
- Crab was a bit on the fishier side in flavour
- Cooked al denté so perfect texture
- Served slightly cold but the center was warm- disappointing.

Warm Spice Caramelized Foie Gras 4.5/5
- Melts in your mouth
- Candies pecans delish
- Tortolone was filled with sweet filling- did not taste too much cheese in there

ras el hanout spiced wood fired globe artichokes  5/5
- wonderful Smokey flavour
- Celery root purée was perfection
- Red spicy sauce was delish
- Fried piece was a nice balance of texture 

Chichillo seared wild Maine scallops 4/5
- scallops were so soft in texture
- Seared wonderfully
- Lacked salt and served cold unfortunately
- Flavour was still great
- Butternut squash kept its soft al dente texture
- Was delicious
- Had nice mix of different textures with the nuts and cheese

Fries 5/5
- great texture and good amount

Charcoal Grilled Wagyu Culotte 3.5/5
- Had great flavour
- Unfortunately a little too chewy, I would not call it wagyu
- Butter Chili sauce accompaniment was great with fries
- Potatoes were crispy on outside but inside was fluffy but bland
- Chimichurri sauce was wonderfully lime in flavour and worked well with steak and avocado 
- the reason I lowered the rating on this is because the steak was too chewy to be called wagyu- if it were priced like a regular steak, this would have scored higher

Ricotta donuts 4/5
- sauces should be served separately
- Over powdered because they were powdered when hot
- Texture was super fluffy
- Not as dense as I thought it would be
- Orange curd was nicer than I expected

Pear Butter Cake 4/5
- No hint of brown butter in this
- It's a nice light dessert
- Almost tastes apple like because of the similar spices
- Pear sorbet tasted like apple pie sorbet",1,A,Counter Culture,Counter Culture,Counter Culture,4.0

"Five stars for the oxtail over yellow rice, collards,  cabbage, & cornbread ($16.99)!

I am beside myself in glee over the delicious meal I brought home. Everything was (is) truly delicious, including the buttery cornbread. The oxtail are flavourful & tender. I'll have leftovers for days! Yea!

"Rather interesting... reading the reviews for Ocean Blue. So many varying opinions! We went for dinner... and were seated quickly, near the Bar / Sushi bar. I didn't care for the sports bar feel... with all the TV's going in the bar, and above the Sushi bar. I prefer a more intimate dining experience... but I am sure this attracts the crowd they are going for. Pop music was blaring pretty loudly too... enough to make conversation a little difficult. We both had a Tempura Appetizer... and it was ok, good selection of veggies, and the shrimp were good. It was a little greasy for me... I like flash fried tempura, that is crispy and not greasy. We ordered three different maki rolls, A Florida roll, a Dragon roll, and an Atom Bomb roll. They were good, with some distinct flavors... especially the Dragon roll (my girlfriend LOVES Unagi... so that was a hit). Service was good, the young lady who waited on us was moderately attentive.. and willing to answer a question or two about the area. And she brought us extra Wasabi... which was nice. 

Food was good, without being spectacular... Service was the same. Ambience was too much Bar... at least for me. So if you like the Bar scene... you may like Ocean Blue!

THE EXPERIENCE

I'm happy to report Wat Mongkolratnaram is actually more deserving of 5 stars now than they were then. Since my 2013 visit I've been back here a few times (twice in 2015) and each has been a fantastic experience. During our Spring Break, we explored the side of the property where the monks live and got to see their offices, kitchen and worship areas. We were not allowed in the sleeping quarters, but everything else was open. We also spent that visit trying different foods from different vendors. Some we like, some we didn't.  During our Christmas Vacation, we concentrated instead on the foods we already know and love - Mango Sticky Rice, Beef Noodle Soup, Thai Fried Chicken Wings and Thai tea. Each seemed to be even more spectacular than the last time we ate here. 

It was a perfect Florida winter's day where the temperature, by Atlanta standards, was t-shirt weather! We arrived a little later than usual (around 10:45 am) and had to park further back that we've ever had to park before. Although very crowded, all the lines moved quickly with the exception of the beef noodle soup line and fried custard line. You can expect to stand in the soup line better than 25 minutes if you don't get there BEFORE the vendors open @ 10:30 am.


THINGS TO REMEMBER

* BRUNCH is SUNDAY ONLY
* GET HERE EARLY!!! It will help you avoid being way at the back of the lines, help you secure a better parking space and you won't have to search for an available table to sit down and eat your meal. 
* Many of the monks will not hold a conversation with you NOR will they take a picture with you, but they will direct you to a leader who'd be happy to do both. 
* Be respectful of the temple and other buildings occupied by the monks. THIS IS A PLACE OF WORSHIP and anyone coming here, no matter your religious beliefs, should honor their ways. SHOES OFF in the temple and no loud speaking or vulgar speech. 
* Sometimes when it is really cold outside or raining they have an area behind the vendors that is covered and has additional seating. The restrooms are also located there. 
* This is an outdoor facility with communal tables. Other than the covered areas provided, you WILL be subject to temperatures and the wind of the day, so dress accordingly.


FINAL THOUGHTS

If you've never been to Wat Mongkolratanaram of Florida, you are missing out on a real treat! Make plans to stuff your face in this place soon!

"Oxford Exchange is celebrating their one year anniversary with a new sandwich shop and juice bar, o.e. market, that offers take-out quick service menu items.

Tonight my husband and I were invited with other OE Commerce Club Members to an exclusive sneak preview of o.e. market.  Located on the corner of South Hyde Park Avenue and Grand Central Avenue, down the street from Oxford Exchange, o.e. market offers a to-go menu for those that don't have time to dine at Oxford Exchange.  The menu includes hot and cold sandwiches, homemade chips and pickle sides, fresh squeezed juices, teas and cold brew coffees.

We had a chance to sample many of the sandwiches from the menu as well as the amazing fresh juices.  All of the sandwiches are served on a choice of a Tuscan or gluten-free rolls.  The toppings ranged from classic turkey and cheddar or ham and swiss to innovative short ribs and horseradish smoked ricotta or pork belly and creamed kale.  Some of the combinations sounded strange, but worked.  I don't think I would have normally ordered a hummus sandwich with cauliflower and roasted red peppers, but I really enjoyed this sandwich.  Also loved the homemade chips.  The sweet potato chips were sweet and salty with sea salt and cinnamon and the kettle chips were seasoned with spicy black pepper and a smoky sea salt.  I will definitely be back to try the market slaw with apple, cabbage, carrots, basil, yuzu, and toasted shallots.

I grabbed a menu at the sneak preview.  The prices aren't cheap, but they aren't ridiculous.  Sandwiches range from $8-$12 and the sides range from $3-$6.  The fresh squeezed juices might seem a little high at $8-$10, but if you juice at home you realize the cost of juicing and can appreciate the convenience of grab and go juice.  The only thing on the menu that I thought was priced crazy were the dips.  I'm not talking about hummus or guacamole; I'm talking about condiments.  $1 for cumin ketchup or yuzu pickle juice?!?!  $2 for truffle honey vinegar?!?!?! I'd rather pay more for the chips to have the condiment added for no charge.  I just can't justify paying for condiments such as ketchup no matter how fancy it appears on the menu.  I guess these dips will appeal to the same people who are willing to pay for fancy bottled water; an item that falls from the sky for free.

Other than the condiment prices I can't say enough good things about o.e. market.  Tampa really needs more healthy lunch options and I am excited to make o.e. market my new grab and go spot for lunch.  If you have a little more time to linger there is a bar along the front of the shop.  o.e. market officially opens, Tuesday, November 5th 2013.  Be sure to check it out!!!",33,C,O.E. Market,O.E.

"Went last night for the first time with family of 4.  Was around 6:30, seated right away in a lovely booth.  Mario was our waiter and was quite attentive.  Other members of the wait staff checked in with us as well during the meal.  Clam appetizer was delicious, a bit on the salty side, and they brought out more bread for us to soak up the garlic sauce too.  I had the meatball/sausage red sauce with housemade spaghetti; thoroughly enjoyed it and hubby kept eating off my plate too.  He had the lobster ravioli which he really liked as well.  My son had lamb shank and mushroom risotto and lauded the risotto as one of his favorites.  Fourth entree was eggplant with linguini for our vegetarian; looked really nice and large portion but I didn't ask to try it.  Had 2 glasses of house Chianti and overall we really enjoyed our first experience here.  We live nearby, so looking forward to trying their family takeout menu to see if delivery food same quality as we had in house, apparently only $15 per person for a four course meal.",6,A,Babbaluci Ristorante Italiano & Lounge,Babbaluci Ristorante Italiano & Lounge,Babbaluci Rist0rante Italian0 & L0unge,5.0

"The Palm Ave sandwich shop is a tiny cafe tucked away next to an old transmission shop. It's easy to miss if you're not looking for it. Every day they put out a hot lunch special that consists of typical Spanish cuisine, i.e. Rice, beans, pulled pork, picadillo, etc. it always looks fresh and tasty. 

Other made to order items include Cuban sandwiches, chicken or steak sandwiches, Cuban cheese toast, etc. No descriptions on the sandwiches. Don't ask, just order and enjoy a great Latin experience. 

On to my personal addiction - the mind blowing empanadas. Maybe that seems like a bit of an exaggeration, but you would only think that because you haven't tried one of these life changing creations. For $1.50, go ahead and get 4, you won't regret it and it will save you a trip back in for more after you take your first bite. Freshly made each morning, they're filled with hot meat and spices that will change the way you think of empanadas forever.

Today we shared their fried jalapeños and they too were amazing. Again, why do this place have so few stars?!?

"Well, this was my first and last time here. 
I ordered a Cuban Burger and it was awful.  The bread was stale and falling apart, the meat was pre-cooked and reheated. I was told there was chirizo on the burger.-There was not. It came with 2 onions and tomato and Potato snack sticks on it. (huh?) It did not even come with salt and pepper. It was bland, overcooked, and well, even the sight of it was unappetizing.  After a couple of bites, II ended up throwing it away.  

I have always enjoyed the flavorful Spanish foods from around the world in which many Latinos take so much pride in.

However, it got much better from there on. The food does take a bit to come out, but it was clear it was fresh-cooked. I loved the breading. It was well seasoned, thin and crispy. It wasn't like eating a bunch of fried dough. The chicken itself was fresh and the breast I had might have been one of the most moist I have ever had. Lay got mashed potatoes and gravy. They were good. I ordered mac and cheese which actually turned out to be ""deep fried mac & cheese. It was OK, but since it wasn't what I expected, I was a tiny but put off. Now I know though.

We enjoyed an exceptional array of food and flavors from The Humble Butternut last night. It was worth the 35 minute drive and here is why: Let's start with the Mumbai Mule for 2 that combined simple syrup steeped in turmeric & ginger then combined with ginger beer all sent home in a cute mason jar. The roasted cauliflower was our favorite sporting herbs and spices I never seem to be able to duplicate at home. The tandoori chicken was a generous amount with beautiful flavors. Because of the long travel time I feel the Masala French Fries that were oven baked in delightful spices & tomatoes. They were still full of flavor but lost their freshness.

"Atmosphere: I've only been to the Melting Pot once before and it was the one in St Pete. The reason I share this is because my experience there two years ago was enjoyable and definitely good enough to go there again. On the contrary, my experience last night at the Tampa Melting Pot was less than memorable and I don't see myself going back there again under my own power. The first part of the experience was the nasty smell that hits you when we walked in the door. It's hard to describe but it smelled like vinegar and a wet dog. Have you ever been to a friends house or someone else that you know who's house seems overrun by their dogs?!? Yup it smelled like that. Also the place was grimy, the bathrooms were nasty and dated, my silverware was filthy. I could carve with my fingernail in the caked up grime. I did let the server know and she took them though didn't offer to get me new silverware. Also, I don't know how else to describe this place without sounding inappropriate or conceded as the look, smell, appearance, decor and overall experience was well below the standards I would expect for a restaurant like this at it's price point.

I was really looking forward to seeing a successful Latin bakery open in 
South Tampa, one with great Latin sweets. But this is not it. At least not yet. 

I went here looking for your typical Tampa Latin sweet: a guava pastry, not a guava pastry with cheese, or not a guava pastry with coconut. Not a bread ring with guava in it. BUT A TRADITIONAL PASTRY WITH GUAVA ONLY. Guava pastries are the most popular Latin sweet in Tampa, and the measure by which most bakeries are judged. If you can't make an excellent guava-only pastry, you are in trouble. They had none. Not good. They better get with the program and bake fresh every day the basic stuff that Tampa people want. 

They had other stuff, like dulce de leche-stuffed pastries, some cupcakes and flan. But most of it looked old or badly executed. The cupcake frosting looked half-melted and the food coloring was running. The savory croissants were good. 

The actual cafe is nice and has a nice seating area. But the food doesn't look good, like they have no idea what they are doing. Some of the baked goods are not labeled, the rest are labeled with pieces of paper and MASKING TAPE, wtf????

""Old South"" style poutine sent me on a river boat ride of flavor, a pickin' and a grinnin' to a delicious deliverance that really has to be experienced.  It ain't health food but it is worth every single calorie I greedily packed on.

Second trip, I couldn't find a partner to share the poutine with, and wanting something more dinner-like i opted for the daily special -- a half rack of ribs for $9.95.  To go with it I went with some coleslaw and a salad.  Now, I have been to at least 12 BBQ restaurants in the Bay Area, and hands down these are the best ribs I have had.  Was i expecting it? No. This place has a different atmosphere that doesn't scream our ribs literally melt off the bone. but the kicker is they do and not because they are overly fatty or cooked far too long.  These are ribs done absolutely right, and that's something I go whole hog for.",10,A,Old South Chic 'N' Ribs,Old South Chic 'N' Ribs,Old S0uth Chic 'N' Ribs,5.0
"This was a pretty cool casual place. The feel was like a 70's hippy party with pretty good food. The waitress was really great, kept a smile on her face and made some good suggestions. I started with the conch chowder, not what I expected or was hoping for. I personally did not like it, I tried to eat what I could, but I just can't stomach cooked tomatoes like that. It was more like a chili. However, the smoked fish dip was good. I also had the crab cakes dinner- those were really good and I liked the cole slaw that came with it. I would say the rice and beans needed a little seasoning but not bad and perhaps it would work for others. My friend has the beer cheese and bacon burger- absolutely loved it. He said it was the best burger he's ever has and it was too big to finish. I'd say the food was pretty good over all, it's like someone was in their kitchen experimenting and came up with some good recipes! Nothing super fancy but still delicious. Based on experience, food, and price I'd say this is a good 3.5 stars, but because there's no half I'll round up because of the awesome waitress who kept a smile on her face.

"I've never had mediocre food here, and I've eaten here a lot. The service is quick, the sushi chefs are fun to talk to at the bar, and most importantly, the food is delicious. 

I decided to get crazy and order something besides sushi for once, and I was not disappointed. The crispy red snapper was incredible! No bones, no soggy coating. It really was crispy and perfectly cooked. The jasmine rice it was served with was fluffy with great flavor. I could tell it had been cooked properly the second I saw it. I would definitely order this again.

The chicken teriyaki is a HUGE portion! My sister ordered it without pineapples, and I didn't feel like anything was missing. The chicken was easy to cut, had a great sear, and was juicy throughout. I even took home the leftovers, and it was just as tasty the next day!

For an appetizer, I always order the agedashi tofu. I swear, that sauce they make is perfection - sweet and savory without being too salty. The tofu really soaks it up and is scrumptious with every bite! The bonito on top is not overwhelmingly fishy at all. It just adds a bit of saltiness and texture to the soft tofu.

My friend ordered the sunomono (something I would die if I had to eat). It's a mountain of pickled cucumbers (not quite ""pickles"") with a few pieces of seafood. I absolutely hate cucumbers and would never order this, but my friend seemed to enjoy it. He remarked that he expected it to come with a better balance of cucumbers to seafood, and I don't blame him. It was like two whole cucumbers on a plate with an afterthought of protein. That being said, I didn't order it and never will, so I won't factor it into my review. Whoever orders a dish knowing lots of cucumber is coming really... well... gets what's coming to them, I guess. 

Anyway, I love this place, and you should go. Two of my favorite sushi rolls are the Hawaiian and the Tokyo (no cucumber!!!).",26,B,Samurai Blue Sushi & Sake Bar,Samurai Blue Sushi & Sake Bar,S@mur@i Blue Sushi & S@ke B@r,5.0

Only problem that makes me snatch a star away is the lack of customer service.

"My husband loves Hibachi, and my kids are getting to the age where they can appreciate the show, so we decided to check out Kuchi. 

Overall, our experience was good. Our chef was actually Japanese, which made this the first time we had a Japanese hibachi chef in Florida. He was hilarious, squirting sake into the adults' mouths and water into my son's face (to his delight). They were very generous with firing up the grill -- I'm relieved we left with eyebrows still intact. The kids loved it!

Service was a little slow. It appeared that one waitress handled all the orders, drinks, salad, and soup for the whole Hibachi room. It was fine, except that I probably would have ordered another bottle of sake if she'd been able to come back and ask if I wanted anything else. Oh well, their loss. The sake they serve is not great quality, so I probably avoided a hangover by not getting more. My husband was not offered another bottle of beer, and the water was slow to be replenished. I left very thirsty.

The food was fine. It was pretty standard Hibachi. My husband and I both had the steak and shrimp combo. My husband added on a side of lobster. My daughter had the kid shrimp meal, my son had the kid chicken meal. The kids loved the noodles and the veggies. We all felt that the salad was too creamy, could have been more acidic.

We'll probably return again for Hibachi once I recover from the salt bomb. This certainly was the best Hibachi I've had in the Tampa area. And I'll probably order two beers for myself to avoid dehydration during the salty meal.",34,C,Kuchi Sushi & Hibachi,Kuchi Sushi & Hibachi,kuchi sushi & hibachi,4.0

"Since I moved to Tampa 6 months ago, I am always willing to try new places but yelpers, you're really letting me down!  I drove past this place yesterday and thought hey, let me give it a try.  I checked yelp and google reviews, even went to their website before going in.  It looked similar to Jersey Mike's Subs so I thought it would be ok at least.  I was looking forward to trying the chicken salad but just in case I ordered a club also since I know I can be picky.  Can't tell you what either tasted like since I left after waiting over 10 minutes and observing practices I just don't care for.
1) I started to say what I wanted on my sandwiches while ordering and I was told they'll take care of that part later. (I guess that's fine.)
2) I wasn't told what to do after that so I followed the guy in front of me over to the cashier since he looked like he knew the routine.  After he paid, the person who took our orders and rang him up immediately went in back to make a philly steak sandwich.  I stood there looking stupid for a few minutes, holding my toddler when I realized maybe I should just sit down and they'll get to me.
3) While I sat, I watched the lady who had been slicing the meat ask the one patron who had already been sitting in the store when I walked in what he wanted on his sandwich.  I thought, I guess this is going to take awhile.
4) While the other 2 were busy preparing sandwiches, another person came in ( maybe the owner) and dumped a few trays from the outside eating area and then started packing food.  I kept wondering was he ever going to wash his hands???  Then, he went over and started taking orders.
At that point, I was done.  I don't know where this guy came from but 9 times out of 10, he was going to wind up handing me my food and ringing me up with his filthy hands.  No thanks.  I'm a freak about cleanliness and if it's not up to par, I'm out.  I got up and as I walked towards the door, the lady said but it's ready.  How could it be ready?  You never talked to me about what I wanted on it, no one has even addressed me since I walked in???  Not to mention, I was already nervous because I couldn't actually see the condiments and had no idea whether I was going to get brown lettuce or what.  I sort of like to see how clean the condiments are kept because some places aren't on top of things like that and I'd rather not eat at those places!

Nice people working there and has a beautiful view if you take your sandwich outside the building. I was expecting more options but it was basically a basic sandwich stop. I asked for the Kaiser roll ( reviews made me think I was getting New York quality food ) but it was an oversized hamburger bun. Was very disappointed in the bread. I also  like my sandwich meat sliced thin and the slices were very thick. If I order sandwiches I order boars head.. this was definitely a cheaper quality of meat.

"Update: I still love the Nutrition Factory. We are now down 20lbs in 3 months- and I use these delicious meals if I have things to do and I can't bring prep- or if I'm tired of meal prep and just want something different and yummy. 

Stats: getting to the Nutrition Factory from work is a PITA.  By no fault of theirs, I would rather run into ongoing traffic than drive on Hillsborough- but unfortunately I work on Hillsborough, so no options. 

I used to go to Pollo Tropical and get a Caesar salad + two chicken breasts. Bam. Protein. And I was okay with that- but the sodium count. And it's expensive af to do that. Now I'm torn between Nutrition Factory smoothies and bowls. I can customize these bowls to fit my low carb days- or my higher. The sauces are fantastic. I went through a chicken hating phase because it's so- blah- but I'm considering purchasing the protein by the lb here because admittedly, they cook way better than I do. 

Let's talk about this customer service for five seconds. I always order online now. I love that flexibility. When I come pick up, everyone is so nice- even though I'm still pretty fluffy and old me would have ran the other way to avoid being anywhere near the beautiful people of Powerhouse and attached Nutriton Factory. The employees don't even bat an eye at any additional fluff- and I like that. We all start- or in my case we all stall somewhere right? (I just consider mine a perma bulk) (lol) Anyways-

Here I am- living breathing proof that you cannot outtrain a bad diet- but when you learn how to use your environment you can both eat healthier- and actually enjoy it.

To start the beer came with frozen glasses. The best, had to have two.  My sister-in-law wanted hot tea  and they don't serve hot drinks.  Had a great waitress who warmed up iced tea for her.  She took the time to get it right for her.

Based on recommendaton, we had the queso fundido, half with chorizo and half with chilles.  It was the best ever.  I would return just to have that.  Chips were fresh and tasty. 

We added the tortilla soup (one mild and one spicy) which was very flavorful.  The tacos my brother-in-law had were excellent.  My sister-in-law wanted a bean taco. When she ordered it with black beans,  the waitress suggested brown beans, afraid the black would be too moist.  Again, she helped her out with great suggestions.

"I've been coming here on and off for 3 years. Never tried the food, only the smoothies. First, let me say that 75% of the time their smoothies have been good. A few missteps I've experienced in terms of their service include taking a while (even when not busy), giving me the wrong order or giving someone else my order. Also, while most of the employees are really nice.There is a weird smell in there, but it's similar to other smoothies shops, so I'm assuming it's the ingredients and most likely proteins and such.

"SIX is a brand-new, eclectic, modern, upscale but laid-back American Bistro & Rooftop Bar on the 6th floor of the new JW Marriot Water Street Resort and I have a feeling it will be the newest hot spot in Downtown Tampa. SIX features a bar area, outdoor dining areas, outdoor lounge areas, and indoor dining offering amazing views of the rooftop pool, the water, the convention center, & the Sail Pavilion! 

The Shrimp Humphrey came with feta, ricotta, spinach, bacon wrapped shrimp, & madeira sauce. The portion size was a little small but it was tasty. 7/10 

The Focaccia Crusted Grouper came with seasonal mushroom broth, potato gnocchi, peas, and fresh squeezed lemon. 9/10 

The JW Cocktail consisted of Johnny Walker Black, Suze, Lemon, & Simple Syrup. 8/10 

The BDX Sour consisted of Bufallo Trace Whiskey, golden fallernum, yuzu marmalade, & Bordeaux. 8/10 

The Six Bistro & Rooftop Bar serves clam chowder, Focaccia, duck confit bruschetta, rock shrimp Ceviche, croquettes, shrimp Humphrey,chicken meatballs, 5 types of salad with 4 types of protein, burgers, cauliflower steaks, braised lamb shanks, roasted farm raised chicken, house-made tagliatelle, day boat scallops, seared ribeye, & bouillabaisse.  

Our server was very friendly, helpful in explaining the menu, and pretty quick. All the food was great and the views were really nice! I definitely recommend checking the Six out if you're in the downtown area! I look forward to enjoying another sunset and some good food here again soon!

"This is my updated review. 

I was one of the first people to review this location of the Naked Farmer when it opened. It wasn't the best experience. Jordan the owner of Naked Farmer reached out to me to ask if I would try them again. Jordan explained they definitely had some hiccups opening during a pandemic. I really appreciated the gesture and Jordan even gave me a credit to use toward my next purchase. Thank you, Jordan! I also found out they are opening a new location in downtown Tampa in October of 2021! Great news! 

They have changed up their menu items and options a bit and I really like the changes! This time I ordered 2 build your own Farmers Baskets. This comes with 3 harvest sides!! Nice! 

We both got the farro and summer vegetables base. They were out on our first visit but had it this time and it definitely is my favorite base. Really yummy! One bowl we got with the beef and one with the seasonal rosemary chicken. Both of these were great! I preferred the beef and my boyfriend preferred the chicken. I too liked the chicken but I'm weird and don't like much fat and the chicken had skin and fat on it. It did help with the flavor but I have to take it off. This is strictly a preference issue because the chicken I tasted was very good and my boyfriend loved it. 

I have to admit that the harvest sides are my favorite part of the meal! Again, I'm not sure if they put some sort of magic into these roasted sweet potatoes, but sweet, baby Jesus, they are good! Why can't I make them taste that good?!?! Anyway, unless you are some kind of freak who doesn't like sweet potatoes, get these and make your day much better! 

I also got the Mac and cheese. I hadn't tried this before, so I can't compare from my last visit. All i can say is this is delicious! The crunchy top did me in! Some Mac and cheese is too sweet for me. Not this one! Perfection! 

My third harvest side was the watermelon, feta, basil drizzled with chili oil. This was so much better this time! A decent serving of watermelon, feta, basil and I have to say the addition of the chili oil made this pop! I loved it as a fresh, sweet end to my yummy meal! 

My boyfriend got the charred broccoli with lemon and garlic. He thought it was quite tasty! 

The only issue we had is that we ordered the cilantro avocado undressing but got the vinaigrette instead. I like vinaigrette but I think it would be better for a salad and not our farro. It was too sour and didn't work at all with the other flavors. Luckily I did a taste test before using it all and realized it was the wrong dressing. 

Our order went much more smoothly this time. No problems ordering through the app or paying. Pick up was smooth and I really like how you get a text after asking if your order went smoothly. 

Thank you Jordan for being such a great owner and wanting all your customers to have a wonderful experience and meal from your business! I hope you will keep me updated on the new location opening up in October!",26,B,Naked Farmer,Naked Farmer,naked farmer,5.0

"I'm a fan of everything Ichicoro and have been to their Seminole Heights and St. Pete restaurants but I just recently started ordering from their Armature Works location during the COVID19 pandemic. 

I've only ordered the pork tonkatsu from this location. Tonkatsu is a Japanese dish consisting of a breaded, deep fried (tempura like) pork cutlet typically served with rice, shredded cabbage and a dipping sauce. Sounds like it would be greasy but if it's done correctly it's nothing but delicious pork goodness. 

This restaurant used to serve the tonkatsu with pickled veggies and slaw and they've changed the entree a bit since the first time I ordered it to now include rice instead of their slaw. If you want the slaw (which is actually good) you have to order it as a side. The pork portion size is generous but still pricier than what you get at other Japanese restaurants (gotta pay the AW rent!). Their sauce dipping sauce is thick, a bit tangy and mildly sweet. It's ok but not my favorite. 

The tonkatsu we had at Ichicoro Ane (St. Pete) was definitely better in terms of taste and quality.",0,A,Ichicoro Imoto,Ichicoro Imoto,Ichicoro Imoto,3.0

The regular bartender here is one of the most inattentive bartenders I've ever come across. Even on a slow night like this evening, you will have to wait.

He could definitely use a semester at bartending school or a lengthy class on customer service.

"Mac & Cheese. And they deliver. Traditional style and could use a lil more seasoning. But very wholesome.

Made to order, hot, reasonably priced, and filling. Reminded me of the penne pasta with cheese at Sal's Salumeria off Broadway in the Bronx, NYC. This is authentic homestyle cooked just right, made with pride stuff. It exceeded my expectations. I tried the Italian 9"" which came in a large tin with ricotta, hamburger meat, and mozzarella cheese over perfectly al dente macaroni (they call it Max here). 

My order came out fast and it's an open kitchen so you can see the action. There's a large menu board and daily special. You order at the counter (or you can phone it in) and soon it's delivered out to you. 

The owner was nice, friendly and passionate about the place. It's a good anti-Oxford Exchange (which is around the corner, University of Tampa is across the street) in the sense that it's low frills with just a few tables and not a lot of frou frou. Enjoy!!!

"I wrote a rave review recently, and some friends have visited a couple of times since.  But this is a report from their last visit a few days ago - two ladies for lunch.
The food was still excellent, BUT before going I would now call them to verify that they have enough staff, because my friends had a bad experience.  One guy and a kid helper who didn't help much.  People would come and wait 1/2 hour and hadn't ordered yet and left.   And I'd tell them that unless I saw at least someone in the kitchen and another competent person out front that I would leave.  And tell them that I would check the bathrooms and unless they were clean, I would leave.  No light in the ladies room, and told to use the men's room which was too disgusting to describe here.  A restaurant inspector once told me that regulations don't allow you to go in the kitchen at a restaurant, but if you look in the bathroom, that's an indicator of the cleanliness of the kitchen.

Prices might be a little high, I'm not sure.  Since I don't get out to yogurt joints often, I can't mentally compare the prices.  What I can tell you is that our little bowl of magic was about 3/4 full and it the cost was just under $5.

"I have a number of Puerto Rican friends and every so often I ask them for good restaurants. One that's popped up more than a few times has been La Caison on North Armenia Avenue. They mentioned that this would be the place they'd take their serious dates, grandparents or bosses to because the food is expertly prepared and the ambience is one that emphasizes tradition. There is also a dress code so don't expect to be seated if you're wearing a tee shirt and have bare feet.
I decided to go around 3 PM, too late for the lunch crowd and too early for the dinner patrons.
Perfect timing. 
The seating arrangements follow true to the six feet of separation and the waitperson was wearing a mouth and nose covering. 
Although the interior is a bit small it is colorful. To your left as you enter, for example, there is a framed prominent family crest flanked by two original paintings, each depicting a Puerto Rican woman preparing food to cook. I included these in an attached picture because they give a true representation of the cooking - all down home and professional.
I ordered one of their specials - a porgo frito or fried red snapper. It normally comes with sides of pink beans and rice but I requested platano fritos (ripe plantains) and a salad instead. 
The fish was tenderly done with each forkful smoothly separating the filet into bite-sized pieces. The experience was, to the best of my imagination, like getting the inside of my head and mouth massaged to the point where I could easily imagine myself sliding out of my seat. It was warm but not hot and very pleasantly digestible. 
The platanos, although not fried in butter, were moist and warm. I had no problem eating them and, in fact, had to convince myself to slow down.
Their salad is a basic one with leaf lettuce, tomato slices, a few thin onion rings and some sliced green olives which you can drizzle over with their house peach-based salad dressing (no strong sugary flavor).

One bite would have way too much crunch and the next would have none. The flavor was pretty decent. The 911 roll was advertised as spicy but there was no spice to speak of.

"Out of all the Mexican options in Tampa do not come to Crazy burrito. They are over priced, the staff is incompetent and they charge for salsa even though the sauces on the table are the same thing.

Okay. I am a bit of a road warrior and I've spent more than my fair share of time in airports all across this great country. 

Through my travels, I've learned the art of airport dining. You can't go for everything in you see, folks. Something told me the burger was gonna be cardboard, so I skipped it.

But the handmade onion rings...now, that sounded promising. Plus, I could see the humongous pan of thick, freshly cut onions being prepared in the kitchen. So, even though it was only 8am... I ordered onion rings and tt hey were friggin fantastic!

Six rings come in the order, and a buttermilk onion ring sauce. My kids  said the sauce was amazing! I say NO to all mayo!!! (Yuck!)

They were hot n fresh. Maybe, the breading could've stayed on a bit better and maybe they could get them a touch longer to get crispier. But even with that, they were Goody Goody!! And I wanna go back and order a batch just for me! (But who am I kidding, in motherhood, nothing is just mine, anymore - LOL!",32,C,Goody Goody,Goody Goody,Goody Goody,5.0

"The people here were very nice and welcoming. Granted they don't get much people coming in and out of their restaurant but they are at a seasonal location. 

Anyways the food was amazing. Was scared to try the alligator bites but like the waiter said it's just like tender chicken. It was fried perfectly and the breeding was interesting. The sauce it came wit just added to the flavor. The tuna ceviche was surprisingly good. I don't like raw fish like that but the combination with the fresh chilled avocado and the spicy chipotle was great! It was really a delicious textural different temperatures dish.

"If you're looking for a gem downtown you should check out Garrison Tavern!

I stayed at the Marriott hotel on Water Street and found out that they have a nice little gastro-pub downstairs near the lobby. Made a great little spot to grab some bourbon bbq wings and have a German style Garrison Beer. The short ribs were fantastic and surprisingly the Brussels Sprouts (I grew up detesting the little devils) knocked my socks off 10/10! 

They have a bunch of tvs and one of their walls is a giant screen. They'll even put a game on that bad boy if you ask them! (I watched a Bolts game and the players were bigger than in real life lol) They also have virtual top golf (also includes:hockey, football, baseball, etc) which I would've loved to try out if my friends had stayed down here with me. I just watched others play baseball and hockey on it instead. It was entertaining even to watch. 

Alex the bartender was super friendly and knowledgeable about the drink options for me. Talked me into getting a Kolsch Beer (German), it had just enough hops but the smoothness of a lager and I really enjoyed it. Marco did a great job the second time I went, it's nice to see when a server genuinely cares about your experience. And when I was in a rush one day the hostess, Cherie (I think that's how you spell it), took my to-go order for me and was very sweet. 

I wish I took pictures but I'm usually too hungry to think about it until my fingers are covered in wing sauce :)

"I ordered quarter St. Louis Ribs, pulled pork, and burnt ends for my meats.  The ribs were very tender and flavorful.  They did not have the ""bite"" of a competition rib, but were very good.  The pulled pork was okay.  It did not have much flavor, but was tender.  The burnt end were also very tender and decent flavor.  They used much less black pepper than a KC or TX burnt end which I am more used to.  I also ordered collard greens and cole slaw as sides.  The greens were awesome!  The cole slaw was not as creamy as I prefer, but not bad my any means.  This is one of the better BBQ restaurants outside of BBQ country that I have been to.

They have a wine for everyone and the prices are fair, plus they have fun flights with generous pours. The service is friendly and informative if you have questions and I've never been given a bad recommendation. The food is a little less exciting and I'd give that 3 stars, it's also quite affordable so I can't complain too much, but it's just not the star here--admittedly, maybe it's because I've tried the wrong things. The truffle fries were good, not too truffle-y which I liked. The chicken tenders were a very small portion but I only wanted a snack to split, so it was perfect, if a little heavy on the breading. All of their sauces were DELICIOUS; we tried the honey mustard, BBQ, chinichurri, and truffle aioli. I've also had the salad during a previous visit and it was not my favorite, just felt very one-note.",32,C,Cru Cellars @ Armature Works,Cru Cellars @ Armature Works,cru cellars @ armature works,4.0
"Lan's Deli is an office building cafe in Westshore (end of Cypress) that serves cheap and tasty sandwiches and such. I'm not saying this is 5 star cuisine but when compared to other office cafes, Lan's stands out to me. 

Let's start with Lan herself, a very nice lady who will remember your name and considering this cafe is a one-woman operation, she is really efficient. I normally don't have to wait more than 7 minutes to get my food after ordering. This is important because I only take 30 minutes for lunch. So I give her 5 stars for service.

The food is better than your standard sandwiches from office cafes. She uses a few different types of breads and croissants. For instance, she uses pumpernickel bread on some sandwiches. Didn't know if I would like that with my Beefeater sandwich but it is actually very good. She also puts a little twist on her chicken salad sandwich and whatever else she makes. As Lan is Vietnamese, she also makes a couple Vietnamese items on certain days - summer rolls with peanut sauce on Tuesdays and pho on Wednesdays (which might be her busiest day). What other office cafe has that? I'm trying to get her to make banh mi. She doesn't think there would be a demand for it but if you go, ask her for it and maybe if enough people do, she will add it. 

Another reason for 5 stars is the price. I stopped visiting another office cafe because they raised their prices to almost $9 a sandwich. At Lan's, all of her sandwiches are in the $5-7 range and they taste better! On top of that, the atmosphere is nice. It's in the middle of an atrium with 40 foot ceilings that has trees and lots of natural lighting from the glass ceiling. Very relaxing, especially since this office building doesn't have many workers. So 5 stars for Lan's!",36,C,Lan's Deli,Lan's Deli,L@n's Deli,5.0

"My neighbor and I have been plotting for weeks about going out one night and shooting some pool, and we finally connected this past week. Not far from where we live is Barley's Billiards and Grille located along Anderson Road, directly opposite the AMC Veteran's 24 movie theaters, and in the same little strip mall with a Subway and an Amscot check-cashing store.

Barley's is a surprisingly nice, upscale billiard hall with six well-balanced, regulation tables covered in new felt. You certainly can't blame the tables for any crappy bank shots! Along the right-hand side of Barley's is a full bar, where a number of people were sitting and relaxing while watching sports on the big-screen TVs all across the back wall and over the bar area. In one of the corners are two electronic darts boards which attracted a lively crowd, and on the back tables were a variety of board games to keep everyone amused.

There are drinks specials each night, and some discounts on various food items throughout the week. The night we were there (Tuesday) was $2 Taco Tuesdays, and you could order spicy shrimp, marinated beef or chicken, and marinated fish tacos for $2 each. The menu has a lot of bar appetizers and burgers, sandwiches, wings, tacos, and a few Asian options like eggrolls and tempura sushi rolls.

Barley's attracts a fun crowd of experienced cue-Masters and their friends who enjoy the relaxed atmosphere and the no smoking ban. They have league play on some nights, but also cater to amateurs. On Sundays they offer pool for $4 an hour, otherwise plan to pay between $5 - 7/hour depending upon time of day. Barley's features weekly lunch specials with 2 hours of free pool with your lunch order. They also have a special Happy Hour on Mon - Weds from 4 - 7pm with free pool during that 3-hour window of time.

If you enjoy shooting pool, then this is definitely your place. You'll see amateurs all the way up through some of Tampa very best players, and everyone is having a great time. The action at the tables is fun, and the full bar plus a good kitchen equals a nice evening. No one will get in your face an hassle you, but expect to hear wild cheering if you're able to successfully run the table.",24,B,Barley's Billiards & Grille,Barley's Billiards & Grille,Barley's Billiards & Grille,4.0

So far, I've had the Swann Ave Special, Italian, Hyde Park and Caprese. All are excellent sandwiches. I also really enjoy the pasta salad side item.

"The best dining experience I have had in a long time! I came here with a Groupon for $20 worth of food that I bought for $9.60. I arrived 45 minutes before closing (dinner time), but assured my server (Brandon) that I would be quick and would not be one of those customers who stay past closing time. He was very nice, friendly, accommodating, and easy to talk to.

First off, they provide peanuts at every table - similar to Five Guys. I ordered the Onion Rings ($5.99) and Shrimp Pasta ($12.99). While I was munching on the Onion Rings, Josh (a manager or owner, I'm not sure which) came by and had a nice chat with me. Apparently it takes them three days to make their onion rings, which explains why they were so good! Josh even gave me a free sample of their clam chowder - how nice!

The Shrimp Pasta came soon after, and wow was it delicious. The garlic bread that came with it was a nice touch. I am impressed by the portion sizes at Shells - it's a lot! Yet the prices are great. My Shrimp Pasta ended up becoming three separate meals for me. Three meals for $13 is pretty good by my book!

Josh also told me about their Wednesday $5 appetizer specials, and their lunch menu. Their lunch-time Shrimp Pasta is $7.99 but is only 25% less food than their dinner-size portion. I will definitely be coming back to Shells. The food is delicious and the service is great.

"We came to the Bizzou Brasserie over the Thanksgiving holiday while staying in the Le Meridien hotel in Tampa. This lounge is located on the second floor and had a really neat vibe. We went for happy hour on Wednesday night and sat at the bar. Matthew was our bartender and did an amazing job! He complemented our taste profiles perfectly. I couldn't believe everything that was offered on the happy hour menu and for an affordable price. That being said, we did order off the cocktail menu. I really loved the aviation cocktail, it was a perfect blend of refreshing without being too sweet. I also had it's all about time, wasn't a big fan but the colors are really pretty. For an appetizer we shared the French quarter dip. It was delicious! While it may appear a little fancy, being in a hotel I think really anything goes. They were so kind to stay open until midnight for us. We came after the lightning game so it was great to grab a bite to eat. The burgers were delicious as well as the flatbread.

"Glad Tampa is finally getting to be a big city with food trucks. We just need to get the city to make it easier for street vendors, but that's for another day. 

Had the Bourbon Mango Pork Kota, while friends had the cheeseburger egg roll, grilled veggie, and pittsburgh. Kota was pretty good but missing the great mark. 

If you are hungry the Kota may not put you over the top, but the bigger sandwiches may be much for some. Good flavor but needed something to pick it up like cilantro, peppers, something. 

Kota is 1/2 size of regular wiches but cored and filled. Chips were sweet and crispy. Kota was $6 so I opted to try a Lychee Lemonade instead of trying the Smashed Balls, too, not knowing the size of either. Refreshing drink with 3 lychees inside. yum.

"If you like pancakes/waffles/french toast(which I do) than this is the place for you!

The sausage was on the top of the omlet instead of the inside. I perfer a little more cheese and not cooked to hard. I've had better omlets else where. The banana nut carmel waffle had so much nuts in it and was really hard to taste the waffle. I think someone accidentaly poured to much nuts. However, The stuffed raspberry french toast with cream cheese was sooo delicious! I would definitely come back for that alone. The pancake, waffle, french toast doesn't come with sides. So if you like meat with your meals like I do than you'll have to order it as an extra. The omlet came with home fries and wheat toast. I ordered in advance for pick up. Customer service was great.

"We went to Bailey's this past week with my sister-in-law and her fiance, on their suggestion (who they also got a suggestion from). None of us had been there before but I know that we will be recommending it.

It was a Friday night at 7pm and we didn't have a reservation, so we had to take the first available, which was a seat outside in a nice little pavilion area. They have apparently just moved from a tiny house location to this new bigger area, which seemed to encompass almost half of a small shopping center on Davis Island. We didn't know about the BYOB otherwise we would have brought one (we just had the house white that was available), but our waitress said that they now have their liquor license and should have a full bar within a few weeks, so I'm not sure how long the BYOB will last...enjoy it while you can!

Since none of us had been to Bailey's before, the 4 of us ordered totally different things each so that we could taste each other's food. The unique thing about Bailey's is that they change their menu almost weekly, other than a few staples that apparently are always there. I had the Jack Daniel's BBQ pork sandwich, with a side of homemade mac & cheese and some couscous; my wife had the coc au vin with mashed potatoes and green beans; my sister-in-law had the meatloaf (more on that in a minute) with broccoli & cauliflower mashed potatoes and another side I have forgotten and her fiance had crab cakes with grits and some vegetables.

Overall, the 4 main courses were amazing. The bbq pork sandwich was sweet and tangy and served on a buttered roll and was way too big for one person to eat, though I did my best. My wife's coc au vin came with pearl onions and mushrooms and everything was cooked and seasoned to perfection, and you were really able to taste the wine in it. The crab cakes were huge and incredibly filling, according to my future brother in law, but the meatloaf was the real star of the night. The description puts it as the owner's mother's recipe and I don't doubt it - it was by far some of the best tasting ""homemade"" meatloaf I have had, with a nice thick tomato crust to it and some great spices that gave it a taste almost of a meatball. Highly recommended.

Our sides were a little bit more of a mixed bag - everyone agreed that that vegetables that were by themselves (green beans and others) tasted a bit like they were out of the can, even though they were highly recommended on the menu, but the mac & cheese and grits picked up the slack. Both were incredibly creamy and tasty and even if you don't like grits, you will LOVE these, as they just taste almost like the mashed potatoes, which were also quite good. My couscous ended up being not exactly what I ordered, as they feature a couscous style salad that is more of a Mediterranean flavor and that was made by the chef for me by mistake, rather than just the simple couscous. I'm not big on the flavors of it but everyone else seemed to really love it and there was more than enough to take home.

The 3 rules for eating at Bailey's are all: You must have desert. So of course, being good little diners, we followed the rules exactly and the 4 of us split two deserts: a peanut butter mousse slice of pie and an ice cream and nuts desert that is caramelized in rum for you at the table. Our waitress went a little heavy on the rum for the ice cream as that was all we could taste after the caramelizing but the peanut butter mousse pie was pretty incredible...there wasn't any left by the 4 of us at the end.

Service was pretty good overall - I have a feeling that by being one of the only groups of diners outside and with a full house inside, we got forgotten a couple of times, but since we were in no rush and our waitress was incredibly friendly and helpful, I won't hold that against them too much. The head chef (Mr. Bailey?) even came out to talk to us and thank us for coming, which was nice for him to do on a busy Friday night. The overall clientele of the restaurant seemed like a mix of a bit of an older crowd and a lot of the Davis Island residents, so it was a nice change from the trendiness you tend to see in other South Tampa restaurants.

I gave Bailey's 4 stars only because the sides were a little disappointing, but I think that with a constantly changing menu that you may end up with something totally different and think my 4 stars are crazy. Now that Bailey's is in a new location, I have a feeling that word will spread and they will get even bigger and better. Check them out for a great meal next time you're on Davis Island.",7,A,Bailey's Restaurant,Bailey's Restaurant,Bailey'sRestaurant,4.0

We have a pleasure to celebrate a friend be late birthday here. The setting is nice with beautiful art on the wall.

I would encourage put more tip money in the plate to support the scholarship for the school since they are not for profit. Come and try out their food since each week is different country until their semester ended of their serving. 

Tonight we have the Greek theme since I miss the season opener last week. The first course is the Greek Salad and The Lentil Soup. The Greek salad is a classic dish in many Greek restaurant. I like the pita bread on top of the salad. It is crispy and top with few pieces of sea salt. The lentil soup is garnish with spinach. The flavor has a twist mixture of the fragrant of food. 

The main course is the Pork Tenderloin serves with Orzo Pasta. The orzo pasta shape like rice cook with olive oil tomato with a bit basil leave. The pork tenderloin is seasoned and baked in oven. The exterior was well salt and the seasoning that went into the meat.  Then it is sliced and served to the customer.  

My favorite is the dessert. Tonight it end with Baklava. I have eat many of baklava and never like it because many of them are sitting too long or wrap in the plastic before it serve. The different of this baklava is freshly prepared with crispy layers of crush. The infill of nuts are crispy and perfect to enjoy.

"Let's be clear the old rise that Yelp closed is not closed just relocated.

Yet there is no way to give yelp feedback.  A paradox given they are in the feedback business yet apparently not open to feedback about themselves!  But this is not a review of Yelp.

So the rise has risen out of its own ashes of poor food and poor service into a beautiful new location that looks high end.  If nothing is different then they will have set higher expectations with the new facility, still deliver below the bar thus disappointing people even more.

So we get seated at a new table with fancy placemats that are dirty.  Oops.  The replacement mat is brought which is dirty.  Oops.  So far just like history, cannot keep their eye on the ball.

The food finally comes.  I am having the pear salad and my partner the chili.  She reports the chili is excellent.  Their Texas version has nice big chunks of beef.  My salad was good.  Apparently the pear in the name only means garnish.

While I am trying to complete my review a baby size fly (or something like it) is buzzing the table and eluding my claps.

I am starting with a good rating but there is a ghost in the wishing well here that needs to be released. Three managers ago we were told they knew what the problems were and they would all be fixed just by moving to the new location.  We now get to find out if that is magical thinking or have they really put the resources into fixing this place.  

OK start so far.

Second visit similar results.  They are running a limited menu at the beginning of the change, but each table only gets one copy of the breakfast menu to share.

Gravy and biscuits are much improved over previous version.  the soft boiled eggs were over done and they have gone back to the English muffins after switching to the better thomas' muffins.


Saturday brunch- looks like in spite of the fact the rise has years of data about their traffic and food ordered,  they can not predict the obvious.  We were seated promptly but told when we ordered that there was a 30 minute wait.  Too many people still ordering breakfast and not enough kitchen space to handle the volume. There is a shock people staying over at a casino get up late on Saturday and want breakfast.  All this on top of the fact they purposely limited their breakfast menu while the get settled in the new kitchen.  This problem was caused before it was built!

When the food arrives exactly 30 minutes after we order my eggs are hard boiled not soft boiled, that takes over 20 minutes to repair.

Management should see they are spending more money on staff time,  burning out their staff, and keeping their customers off the casino floor too long which the most costly part of it for them.

"I get all my ingredients for making Pho, Pad Thai, Thai Green Curry, Chicken Tom Yum, Mango Sticky Rice, etc. and ingredients are ridiculously cheap, so what more could you want? Go get shopping, cooking and creative in your kitchen!

My love for this place will never falter. The staff keeps this place fairly clean and are always busy, so it can be a little bit of a challenge to get help. Honestly, this is more of a place where you take care of yourself and requires you to chase someone down if you have a question or two.

You can purchase Pho starter kit for first timers. I prefer putting together my herbs because it's fun to do and I think it's cheaper, too!

I love coming here to get my Pho ingredients (star anise, cinnamon stick, cloves, coriander, fennel, cardimon pod, fish sauce, rock sugar, ginger, scallions, etc.) to make a satisfyingly yummy broth. Also, I'll pickup a couple pounds of beef bones (marrow, knuckle/leg bones/oxtail) for a rich flavor. For toppings, lime (Stable at my house!), cilantro, basil, bean sprouts are a must to complete the dish. I usually buy over 20 ingredients at this Asian market for a comforting, rich beef broth because this can be a one stop shop for making homemade Pho, which saves time! 

I get my glutinous rice along with full fat coconut milk and sugar, toasted sesame seeds or mung beans, from here to make Mango Sticky Rice and make it in a bamboo cone steamer, which they carry!

These are the core ingredients I get: shallot, garlic cloves, stalks fresh lemongrass, shrimp paste, coriander, fresh kaffir lime leaves, fresh galanga (Thai ginger)...this is the basis you need for Thai dishes, especially when I make Chicken Tom Yum and Green Curry, but you would omit lemongrass and add tamarind along with other ingredients for Pad Thai, etc.

You can get your fresh veggies and herbs at a really, really good price point along with ready to eat Vietnamese snacks to choose from, beef knuckles and organ meat as well as fresh seafood and there's even a small meat department.

This was the follow up after OutPost unfortunately. It was a Tuesday night and there were 25-30 people outside with a bartender and a server on staff. I went inside to make sure someone knew we were sitting outside. A few minutes later a friendly server greeted us and took our order. After 10 minutes a dude walks from the parking lot carrying the type of Vodka I had ordered(odd). 10 Minutes after that we recieve our drinks. I understood that there were at least 4 other tables with food and maybe she was weeded. The second server I didnt even see until we had almost left. 20 minutes for a drink is totally unacceptable we waited for our drinks longer than it took us to drink them. Waitress sweet though.

BArtender inside was kinda slacking. he couldve helped run food or drinks instead of talking to his one customer.

"Sadly, my last visit here cost them a star. Got there 11:45, ordered and we sat down at a nice table. I got a bowl (huge!) of the crab bisque and a half goat cheese/chicken panini. They were slammed, probably because it was a Friday.

My soup arrived, and I tucked in expecting heaven! Well, if heaven is very overspiced soup... yeah. So, I was hungry enough that I plowed ahead, in spite of it being so spicy. I'm diabetic and there are times when I have to eat whatever, and i could feel my blood sugar starting to fall - so I went with it. It was 'sip of soup' 'drink', 'sip of soup' 'drink'. Thats a lot of 'drink' given how big that bowl was. No problem, I thought - my sandwich will rock and thats OK!

My companion had a chicken ceaser - which she loved.

My sandwich finally arrived, and it was cold. *sigh* The fries were good, but I had forgotten to order them with low salt. So, they were borderline inedible for me. *sigh*

By that point, my sugar was fine, and I was over it. I had a lovely time due to the beauty I was with, but its hard to be bitchy and send stuff back in a situation like that.

When I asked for a box, the waitress asked ""was everything OK?"" - well....

So a manager popped by, and I explained to him the shortcomings of my meal. 17 bucks for weak food. He went to check the soup and came back with ""Oh I'm so sorry sir! I'm having the kitchen fix it right now. Way too spicy for sure""

""Thanks for letting me know. I'm sure you'll enjoy it next time"" And off he went.

Really? I'm sure you'll enjoy it next time? Not ""here's a card for your next visit"" or ""let me adjust your bill""?

Worse than the food fail was the manager fail. 

The next day, I microwaved the sandwich, and it was really good when it was hot. Too bad they got the sandwich and soup mixed up in that regard. I'll be back, but next time I'm going to explain how much this visit failed compared to other visits and let them know I need taken care of. Still really surprised that this happened at Nordstroms.

Its only multiple visits here that stopped me from dropping them to 2 stars.",29,C,Nordstrom Cafe Bistro,Nordstrom Cafe Bistro,nordstrom cafe bistro,3.0

"Black Radish Grocer is an all vegan grocer in the Ybor area. It is very small, with not a large variety of products. Each type of product may have one, two or three brands at the most. 

One wall of the shop features a cooler of meat substitutes, coldcuts, vegan cheeses, vegan drinks and produce. There is a small freezer that has some vegan seafood items. The other wall of the shop features vegan snacks such as chocolate, candies and jerky. The aisles in the middle of the store cover everything else. There are canned items, boxed goods, coffee and additional snack items.

I like that Black Radish emphasizes local when possible. For instance, the only brand of coffee on the shelves when I visited was King State. The cooler contained a couple different kombuchas, with Mother Kombucha being one of them. Catalyst Creamery, a local vegan cheese company, is sold here. You can also pick up some Oopsy Daisy Sweets. I also appreciate that even though I know my way around vegan grocery stores, Black Radish had items that I've never seen anywhere else.

Some of the items on the shelves were pricey, some were comparable to what you would find at other grocery stores.

I am excited to watch Black Radish grow. I hope they will continue to support local vegan products when possible and give back to causes they feel are important (I visited on a day when 10% of all sales were donated to the NAACP).",6,A,Black Radish Grocer,Black Radish Grocer,Black Radish Grocer Inc.,5.0
"I enjoyed a very elegant business lunch with one of my clients at The Tampa Club today. The club sits atop the 42nd floor of the Bank of America building in the middle of downtown Tampa, and the view is absolutely spectacular! This incredibly sophisticated members-only business club is definitely the home for the prominent movers & shakers in the local business community.

My 5-star experience started as I stepped off the elevator and walked through the carved-wood archway to the reception desk. My business associate had not yet arrived, but the receptionist had my name on her list and so I was invited to wait in the lounge until he showed up. Back in the day this room would have probably be called the gentlemen's smoking parlor, and I would have felt right at home with a brandy snifter in one hand as I looked at the stylish furnishings and took in the amazing view of downtown.

Once my friend arrived we ascended the staircase to the top floor of the club, and were seated in the main dining room. Our table looked down upon the Channelside District, the Tampa Bay Marriott and out over Harbour Island and right out into the Bay. It was truly a jaw-dropping amazing view.

The dining room was all white tablecloths and impeccable waiter service. My business associate was greeted by name as if he was an old friend of the maître d', the waiter, and the chef at the banquet table, and once I was introduced to our server I was also called by name throughout our meal. Very classy and memorable!

Lunch today was the Club's famous Prime Rib Buffet and we both opted to forego the luncheon salads and splurge on something tasty. The buffet started with a salad table which had a variety of lettuces and garden fresh veggies along with homemade dressings. Next in line were the prepared cold salads including fresh fruits and cheeses, followed by a selection of hummuses and bruschettas, hot vegetables and entrées, and finally the chef-attended prime rib carving station with your choice of au jus, as well as freshly-grated and creamy horseradish. There was no way in the world that I had room for dessert, but they had some incredible pastry selections to tempt the weak of heart.

The meal and the service were perfection, and it was just a tremendous day to look out the windows and enjoy the fact that we live in Florida.

"The meatball sub and Mac and cheese are so good. They have a huge selection of beers, wines, and my favorite, ciders. They always seem to be understaffed though. Service is usually slow so if you are in a rush this isn't the place to stop and grab a bite to eat.",12,A,Taps Restaurant Bar & Lounge,Taps Restaurant Bar & Lounge,Taps R3staurant Bar & Loung3,4.0
"This place is awful. The last 2 times was the same horrible experience. Over priced drinks because of a little flare. 

Floors are still sticky from a year ago. 

They say you need a reservation but we went on Saturday night and the place is half empty. 

The small filthy booth was disgusting. There is a reason the booths are very dark it's because they clearly don't want to clean. 

Furniture is all damaged and gross.",13,A,Ciro's,Ciro's,Ciro's,1.0
